Daniel Mannix Petrie\u00a0 (November 26, 1920 - August 22, 2004) was a Canadian television and movie director.\n\nPetrie was born in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada, the son of Mary Anne (n\u00e9e Campbell) and William Mark Petrie, a soft-drink manufacturer.\u00a0 He moved to the United States in 1945.\u00a0 One of his most famous credits was 1961's A Raisin in the Sun, which was nominated for the Golden Palm award at the Cannes Film Festival. He also directed Buster and Billie (1974), the Academy Award-nominated Resurrection (1980), Fort Apache, The Bronx (1981) and Cocoon: The Return (1988). He directed well-known television movies such as Sybil and Eleanor and Franklin, and produced a 1999 remake of Inherit the Wind. His films were rarely box office successes, but they often feature large well-known casts (such as 1978's The Betsy, starring Laurence Olivier and Robert Duvall), and his films are among the earliest screen appearances by such stars as Winona Ryder (Square Dance) and Kiefer Sutherland (The Bay Boy).\n\nPetrie died of cancer at the age of 83 in Los Angeles, California.
