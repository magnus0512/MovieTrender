He graduated from Louis Lumi\u00e8re National College and is the visiting professor of film at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. Three of his films feature the character of a nameless butcher played by Philippe Nahon: Carne, I Stand Alone and (in a cameo) Irr\u00e9versible. Carne was the recipient of the Critic's Award at the 5th Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival in February 1994.\n\nThe films of Stanley Kubrick are one source of inspiration for No\u00e9, and he occasionally makes references to them in his own works. No\u00e9 also cites the 1983 Austrian serial killer film Angst, by Gerald Kargl, as a major influence. He is married to filmmaker Lucile Had\u017eihalilovi\u0107. His work has been linked to the New French Extremity.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Gaspar No\u00e9, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia", "adult": false}
