Elias Merhige, (born June 14th, 1964) is an American film director born in Brooklyn.\n\nMerhige is best known to mainstream audiences for the 2000 film Shadow of the Vampire, and to underground audiences for the cult-classic 1991 film Begotten.\n\nAs he says in his audio commentary to the Shadow of the Vampire DVD, Merhige views cinema as the only meaningful art form of the present era. He regards literature and drama as once-needed forms which are past their time and which have been superseded by film. He is also very interested in the occult and the paranormal, and images and themes derived from these traditions suffuse his films.\n\nMerhige currently lives in Los Angeles, California.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article E.
