Until its use was formally discontinued in 2000, it was the sole pseudonym used by members of the Directors Guild of America (DGA) when a director dissatisfied with the final product proved to the satisfaction of a guild panel that he or she had not been able to exercise creative control over a film. The director was also required by guild rules not to discuss the circumstances leading to the move or even to acknowledge being the actual director.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Alan Smithee, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "adult": false}
