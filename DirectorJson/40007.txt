Born in Edinburgh, he has worked in British film since the late 1960s, first as an assistant director and later as an independent director himself. He has been described by critics as \"a solid and reliable filmmaker with... frequent flairs of brilliance\", but despite tackling such topics as the Hiberno-British struggle, or the assassination of John F. Kennedy he is generally not thought of as a political filmmaker. Rather, Mackenzie focuses more frequently on narrative, character and plot.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article John Mackenzie, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of  contributors on Wikipedia.", "adult": false}
