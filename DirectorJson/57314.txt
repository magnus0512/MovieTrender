The three worked together on a number of classic Disney shorts, including\u00a0The Band Concert,\u00a0Music Land, and\u00a0Elmer Elephant\u00a0and in all, Reitherman worked on various Disney feature films produced from 1937 to 1981, including\u00a0Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u00a0(Slave in the Magic Mirror) to\u00a0The Fox and the Hound\u00a0(co-producer). He did the climatic dinosaur fight in\u00a0Igor Stravinsky's\u00a0The Rite of Spring\u00a0in\u00a0Fantasia, the Headless Horseman chase in \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" section in\u00a0The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, the Crocodile in\u00a0Peter Pan, and\u00a0Maleficent\u00a0as a dragon in\u00a0Sleeping Beauty\u00a0(the former three he animated and the latter he directed). Beginning with 1961's\u00a0One Hundred and One Dalmatians, \"Woolie\", as he was called by friends, served as Disney's chief animation director. One of Reitherman's productions, the 1968 short\u00a0Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day, won the\u00a0Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. He also served as a producer and sequence director, and starred as himself in the 1941 feature film\u00a0The Reluctant Dragon. All three of Reitherman's sons \u2014\u00a0Bruce, Richard and Robert \u2014 provided voices for Disney characters, including Mowgli in\u00a0The Jungle Book,\u00a0Christopher Robin\u00a0in\u00a0Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree, and\u00a0Wart\u00a0in\u00a0The Sword in the Stone.  Reitherman directed several Disney animated feature films including,\u00a0One Hundred and One Dalmatians\u00a0(1961),\u00a0The Sword in the Stone\u00a0(1963),\u00a0The Jungle Book\u00a0(1967),\u00a0The Aristocats\u00a0(1970),Robin Hood\u00a0(1973) and\u00a0The Rescuers\u00a0(1977). He is also known for reusing animation in movies directed by him. According to\u00a0Floyd Norman, this was just one of his trademarks, and had nothing to do with time or cost savings: \"Woolie was our director on\u00a0The Jungle Book. Reuse was just Woolie\u2019s thing. He never did it to save money. I really don\u2019t think the \u201cOld Guard\u201d ever had any interest in saving money. I was never a big fan of reuse, but it wasn\u2019t my place to tell these old guys what to do. One final thought. It never seemed to bother Walt, and I never heard him complain about reuse.\" -From Wikipedia entry", "adult": false}
