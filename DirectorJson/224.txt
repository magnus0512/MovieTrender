He is one of the principal originators of what is commonly known as the body horror or venereal horror genre. This style of filmmaking explores people's fears of bodily transformation and infection. In his films, the psychological is typically intertwined with the physical. In the first half of his career, he explored these themes mostly through horror and science fiction, although his work has since expanded beyond these genres. He has been called \"the most audacious and challenging narrative director in the English-speaking world.\"\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article David Cronenberg, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "adult": false}
