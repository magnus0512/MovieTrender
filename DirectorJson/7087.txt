He is best known for writing and directing Disney/Pixar's The Incredibles (2004) and Ratatouille (2007). He also adapted and directed the critically acclaimed 2D animated 1999 Warner Brothers film The Iron Giant. Reviewing the Ratatouille DVD, Eye Weekly offered this characterization of Bird's work: \"It's very hard to think of another mainstream American director with a comparably fluid visual style or such a vise-grip on storytelling mechanics.\" He also directed The Simpsons ' episodes \"Krusty Gets Busted\" and \"Like Father, Like Clown\".\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Brad Bird, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia", "adult": false}
