Chu is an alumnus of the University of Southern California School of Cinema-Television. There, he won the Princess Grace Award, the Dore Schary Award presented by the Anti-Defamation League, the Jack Nicholson directing award, and was recognized as an honoree for the IFP/West program Project: Involve.\n\nAfter making his student short, \"When the Kids Are Away\", Chu was signed to William Morris Agency and attached to several high profile projects. Chu was hired by Sony Pictures to direct their feature Bye Bye Birdie but Sony never green lit the film due to budget concerns. Sony recently got back into business with Chu to direct their updated version of The Great Gatsby. He also is in a dance crew called AC/DC or Adam/Chu Dance crew. His father, Lawrence Chu, is a well-known chef and his parents own Chef Chu's, a popular restaurant in Los Altos, California. He also attended Pinewood School from kindergarten through 12th grade. Chu is currently directing the online series The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers.\n\nIn an interview, Chu addressed a question he is often asked, \"Why do all of your films have dance?\" He responded, \"I don\u2019t know why. It seems so obvious. But there\u2019s something about the dancers that motivate me the most. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just dance, but I do think that the dancers are amazing artists, and every time I meet a new dancer, that triggers something in my brain, and I\u2019m more creative than I could ever be. When I feel that creativity burst, I go with it.\"\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Eric Jon Chu, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "adult": false}
