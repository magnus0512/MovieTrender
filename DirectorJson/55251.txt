This festival has restored my faith in film festivals, Sundance is all about the films, the audience and the film makers. Every single screening is sold out. We were told that no one in the US knew who Ayrton Senna was, that there was no interest in Formula One, that we should forget about releasing the film here, so to win the Audience Award at Sundance is just fantastic, it makes us feel so proud. We hope this shows that there is an audience for SENNA in the US, both fans and people who have never heard of him before and I hope this is just the beginning of a long journey for SENNA in 2011.\u201d\n\nWinner of Best Documentary \u2013 Audience Award at the Adelaide Film Festival 2011\n\nSenna has been released in Japan and in Brazil where it had one of the biggest openings for a documentary film ever.\n\nThe film will be released in UK, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Australia, S.
