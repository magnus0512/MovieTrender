He is known primarily for his horror comedies, though he would prefer to be classified as an \"exploitation\" filmmaker (rather than horror). \"I never felt that I made \u2018horror films\u2019, he has said. \"I always felt that I made exploitation films. Exploitation films have an attitude more than anything \u2013 an attitude that you don\u2019t find with mainstream Hollywood productions. They\u2019re a little ruder, a little raunchier, they deal with material people don\u2019t usually touch on, whether it\u2019s sex or drugs or rock and roll.\"\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Frank Henenlotter, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "adult": false}
