His later career helped pioneer the concept of \"thirty-second attention span\" pacing over detailed content in his dramatizations of Rita Hayworth, Calamity Jane, and the Kent State shootings for which he won the Emmy.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article James Goldstone, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "adult": false}
