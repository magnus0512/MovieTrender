Philip Kaufman (born October 23, 1936) is an American film director and screenwriter. Although not noted for directing a large number of films, the films he has worked on have been recognized for their intelligence and independence. He is noted for directing films of eclectic subjects, ranging from realism to fantasy, and often incorporating satire or subtle humor as part of his \u201cartistic signature.\u201d He was born in Chicago, Illinois.  Kaufman has been considered a \u201crisk taker.\u201d He has successfully adapted novels of widely different types \u2013 from Milan Kundera\u2019s The Unbearable Lightness of Being to Michael Crichton\u2019s Rising Sun; from Tom Wolfe\u2019s heroic epic The Right Stuff to the erotic writings of Anais Nin\u2019s Henry &amp; June. According to film historian James Welsh, his candid treatment of adult relationships in Henry &amp; June was considered an \u201cartistic breakthrough by an unconventional filmmaker who was willing to take a chance and put his career on the line.\u201d  His greatest success was the blockbuster film The Right Stuff, where he directed and wrote the screenplay. It earned eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. And his best films have always had his personal imprint, \u201cstressing values of individualism and integrity,\u201d and always being \"clearly American.\"  Description above from the Wikipedia article Philip Kaufman, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia", "adult": false}
