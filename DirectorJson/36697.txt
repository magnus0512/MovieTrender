Real Monsters.\n\nHe was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1952, and after four years at the Pann\u00f3nia animation studios, emigrated to the West in 1975. While working in Sweden he met Arlene Klasky, an American-born animator. The two subsequently started their own company, Klasky Csupo, which produced many popular animated television shows. He was credited as \"animation executive producer\" and \"supervising animation director\" for several episodes of The Simpsons[4] in the early seasons before the show switched over to Film Roman.\n\nHis record label, Tone Casualties, founded in 1994, released several industrial, noise, ambient and experimental music releases, including discs by Holger Czukay, Drew Neumann, Paul Sch\u00fctze, Kuroi Mori, Borut Kr\u017ei\u0161nik, Wahorn, Controlled Bleeding and his own works.\n\nHe also directed two live action films outside of Klasky Csupo: Bridge to Terabithia for Walt Disney Pictures, and The Secret of Moonacre for Warner Bros. and Lionsgate.\n\nThe character design of Dr. Nick Riviera (from The Simpsons) is based somewhat on Csup\u00f3. The animators mistakenly believed the character's voice actor, Hank Azaria, was impersonating G\u00e1bor, when in fact the voice was actually a bad imitation of Ricky Ricardo from I Love Lucy.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article G\u00e1bor Csup\u00f3, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "adult": false}
