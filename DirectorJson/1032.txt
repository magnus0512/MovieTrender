This came shortly after seriously considering entering into priesthood. He entered a seminary in 1956 then opted to direct his focus toward film; he graduated from NYU as a film major in 1964.\n\nScorsese made his first feature-length film in 1967, \u201cCall First\u201d, which was later retitled \u201cWho's That Knocking at My Door\u201d, which was followed by \u201cBoxcar Bertha\u201d (1972). The Film \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d (1976) won the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, and received four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, establishing Scorsese as an accomplished filmmaker operating on a highly skilled level.\u00a0\n\nScorsese has been married five times. His first wife was Laraine Marie Brennan; they have a daughter, Catherine. He married the writer Julia Cameron in 1976; they have a daughter, Domenica Cameron-Scorsese, who is an actress and appeared in The Age of Innocence, but the marriage lasted only a year.

He has been married to Helen Morris since 1999; they have a daughter, Francesca, who appeared in The Departed and The Aviator. He is primarily based in New York City.", "adult": false}
