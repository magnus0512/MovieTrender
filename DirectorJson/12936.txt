Abrahams was born in Shorewood, Wisconsin, to a Jewish family, and attended Shorewood High School.[1] He is known for the spoof movies that he co-wrote and produced with brothers Jerry Zucker and David Zucker, such as Airplane! (for which he was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay) and The Naked Gun series. The team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker (also referred to as \"ZAZ\") really began when the three men grew up together in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Abrahams later produced movies on his own such as Big Business, and further honed his skills in parody with Hot Shots! and its 1993 sequel Hot Shots! Part Deux. He now lives in Eagle River, Wisconsin.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jim Abrahams, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia", "adult": false}
