A former radio DJ, he is best known for anchoring the spoof news and current affairs television programmes The Day Today and Brass Eye, as well as his frequent engagement with controversial subject matter.\n\nIn 2010 Morris directed his first feature-length film Four Lions about a group of inept British terrorists. Reception of the film was largely positive and received a respectable box office. Outside his central work, Morris tends to stay out of the public eye and has become one of the more enigmatic figures in British comedy.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Chris Morris (satirist), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia. \u200b", "adult": false}
