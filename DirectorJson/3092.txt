Keaton made her film debut in the 1972 screen adaptation of Woody Allen\u2019s Broadway play \"Play It Again, Sam\". That same year Keaton was cast in her first major film role as Kay Adams-Corleone in the Oscar-winning movie \u201cThe Godfather\u201d. Keaton established herself as a comic actor in her next two films \u201cSleeper\u201d (1973) and \u201cLove and Death\u201d (1975).\n\nIn 1977, Keaton veered away from her comedic image to appear in the remarkable \u201cLooking for Mr. Goodbar\u201d, which won her a Golden Globe nomination. It was that same year that she appeared in the title role of \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d, which many consider to be her best performance. The following year Keaton was awarded the Oscar for best actress in a leading role, as well as the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Film Award. In the early 1990\u2019s Keaton began to play more mature roles, though she reprised the role of Kay Adams-Corleone in the third \"Godfather\" epic, The Godfather: Part III (1990). She appeared in the well-liked \u00a0\u201cFather of the Bride\u201d (1991) and \u201cFather of the Bride Part II\u201d (1995) as \u201cNina Banks\u201d the wife of \u201cGeorge Banks\u201d played by Steve Martin. Some of her popular later films include: The First Wives Club (1996), Something's Gotta Give (2003) and The Family Stone (2005).
