The film, directed by Rob Reiner, was released on Christmas, 2007. The film tells the story of two men (Nicholson and Freeman) who are roommates in a cancer ward where they learn on the same day that they each have only months to live. When Freeman's character was nineteen, he wrote a list of all the things he wanted to do with his life before he \"kicked the bucket.\" Nicholson plays a millionaire who adds his own wishes to Morgan's list and the two men are soon skydiving, driving vintage race cars and riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle along the Great Wall of China.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Justin Zackham, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "adult": false}
