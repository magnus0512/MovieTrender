As a filmmaker, Davies is noted for his recurring themes of emotional (and sometimes physical) endurance, the influence of memory on everyday life and the potentially crippling effects of dogmatic religiosity on the emotional life of individuals and societies. Stylistically, Davies' works are notable for their symmetrical compositions, \"symphonic\" structure and measured pace. He is also the sole screenwriter of all his films. Contrary to the credits accorded him on IMDB.com, Terence Davies has never acted professionally.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Terence Davies,\u00a0\u00a0licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "adult": false}
