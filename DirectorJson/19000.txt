He also wrote the screenplay for the film Mindhunters, but the final script was heavily rewritten by others and bore little resemblance to Kramer's original work. He was also one of the filmmakers interviewed for the Kirby Dick documentary This Film is Not Yet Rated, in which he discusses the apparent absurdity of the fact The Cooler was given an NC-17 certificate by the MPAA simply due to a few seconds long shot of its lead actress' pubic hair.\n\nIn 2007, Kramer directed Crossing Over, a Traffic-like ensemble drama about immigration in Los Angeles that incorporated the storyline from Kramer's 1995 short film of the same name.\n\nKramer's first feature The Cooler was selected for competition in the 2003 Sundance Film Festival. Kramer was nominated for a 2004 Golden Satellite Award and a 2004 Edgar Allan Poe Award (along with Frank Hannah) for his screenplay to The Cooler, which also received a 2003 Special Mention For Excellence in Filmmaking from the National Board of Review.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Wayne Kramer, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "adult": false}
