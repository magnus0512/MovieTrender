Niccol (born 10 June 1964) is a New Zealand-born screenwriter, producer, and director. He wrote and directed Gattaca, S1m0ne, and Lord of War. He also wrote and co-produced The Truman Show, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay in 1999 and won him a BAFTA award for Best Screenplay. Many of his films, such as Gattaca, S1m0ne and The Truman Show view societal or political issues through a fantasy-science fiction lens. Lord of War, however, was a contemporary, matter-of-fact exploration of gunrunning.\n\nNiccol was born in Paraparaumu, New Zealand in 1964 and grew up in Auckland, where he attended Auckland Grammar School. He left New Zealand at age 21 and began directing commercials in London, England. During the production of S1m0ne, he met model Rachel Roberts, with whom he has a son, Jack in 2003, and a daughter, Ava in 2008.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Andrew Niccol, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "adult": false}
