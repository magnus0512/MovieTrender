Peter Jackson has done it.  He has created an all-encompassing epic saga
of
Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books, and after coming away from the final
chapter, how does this rate not only as a film on its own, but as a part
of
the whole?

Perfect.

I've never seen a series like this.  A trilogy of movies created with
such
love and care and utter perfection of craft that you can't help but walk
away and wonder how did Peter Jackson make this possible?  I have always
loved the original "Star Wars" and "Indiana Jones" series for their epic
storytelling, and just for just fitting in as a great moment in cinema.
This should be, will be, remembered with as much revered fondness for
generations to come.  They do not make films like these
anymore.

As a stand alone film, it picks up immediately where "Two Towers" ends,
so
brush up before seeing it.  I've read the books, and the anticipation of
seeing some of the more profound moments in this film made me kind of
view
it with a rushed sense of perspective.  I wanted to make sure everything
in
this film was done "right".  And when it happened, it was.  I will need
to
see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level.

The cast comes through once more.  The musical score retains its beauty,
elegance and power.  The special effects, notably Gollum again, are
nothing
less than breathtaking, and simply move the story along.  The battles are
monumentally huge and exciting.  There are some liberties taken with the
story, especially during the end with the homecoming, and yet, everything
that needed to be covered regarding the main characters was handled.
After
the greatest moment of the series resolves itself, the story provided a
breather.  And gives a good-bye to friends seen on screen for the last
three
years.  It was truly a bittersweet feeling in realizing that there will
be
no "Rings" movie in 2004.  I will miss this talented group of
actors.

As with the first two, the film is very long, but goes by without you
ever
truly realizing it.  This film is so much more than a simple "fantasy"
epic.
It's a story about strength of character, friendship, loyalty and love.
And while every member of the Fellowship has their part to play, I
finally
understood why some critics have said this series is a story about Sam.
It's his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory.  Sean
Astin
is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic.  As as
far
as the ending goes, they ended it the way that it had to be ended.
Jackson
ended this film the way it should have been.

I will miss looking forward to a new "Rings" movie, but these movies
provide
hope that high-quality films can still be made without special effects
taking over a story, bathroom humor, or a "Top 40" soundtrack.  George
Lucas
could learn a lot from these films about how not to alienate the
fanbase.

Each film has earned a "10" from me for the last two years, which for me
to
give is a rarity.  This one, however, is as equally deserving as its two
predecessors.  The Academy had better not look over this film for "Best
Picture" of 2003.  To do so would be greatly disrespectful of the craft
and
care that anyone involved with these films put into them.
<|_=00=_|>

Saying that this film starts where `Two Towers' left off is somewhat
misleading, for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helm's
Deep. `Return of the King' opens with a flashback of Smeagol (Andy Serkis)
obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into
the
creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat
lost
within the epic battles of `Two Towers,' at that's the ring. The first
installment, `The Fellowship of the Ring,' provided heaps of exposition on
the ring's importance and influence, and in `Return of the King,' we see
it
pay off, big time.

After the armies of Isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance
between Theoden (Bernard Hill), the king of Rohan, and the elves, the main
threat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of Mordor,
controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron has turned his eye towards the
realm of Gondor, the last free kingdom of men, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian
McKellan) must warn Denethor (John Noble), Steward of Gondor of the
impending attack, while Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), heir to the throne of
Gondor, and Theoden gather men to aid against the armies of Mordor. The
dark
lord Sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of
middle earth, and two hobbits, Frodo (Elijah Wood) the ring-bearer and Sam
(Sean Astin), must continue their journey, directed by Gollum, to Mount
Doom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed. Got all that? If
not,
you need to bone up on your `Lord of the Rings' before expecting to follow
this film.

Since all three epics were filmed simultaneously, each individually has
the feel of being part of a larger picture - except for this one. `The
Return of the King' is just too big, the most epic of a set of epic films.
Now that director Peter Jackson has brilliantly constructed the characters
and plotlines throughout the first two films, he puts them to use.

All of the characters have their best moments within this film. The
pair
of mischievous hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd),
are no longer the tree ornaments they were from `Two Towers,' but are
split-up, and take their characters in completely new directions. Aragorn,
played with an unmatched sense of honor by Viggo Mortenson, is about to
meet
his destiny as the future king of all men, while Andy Serkis continues his
expert portrayal of Gollum (Serkis' provided not only the voice of Gollum,
but also assisted during production by acting out the scenes of the
computer-generated character with his fellow actors).

However, the real acting triumph of the film is Elijah Wood as Frodo
Baggins. He continues his descent into corruption with an incredible
talent
that many could not pull off. Wood's performance is so critical to the
film
because it determines the ring's power to corrupt, which, needless to say,
is absolute.

The first two films established Jackson as an incredible visionary,
shooting vast landscapes from his native New Zealand. With `Return of the
King,' Jackson really gets a chance to show off. With, hands down, the
most
beautiful visuals of the trilogy, Jackson makes `Return of the King' a
gorgeous feast for the eyes, while never resorting to McG level
over-the-topness. Jackson stays very grounded in his characters, not
letting
the effects tell the story, but only assist the wonderful dialogue and
characters. Think of `Return' as a mix of `Fellowship' and `Two Towers,'
with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event
of this magnitude.

The bottom line, fans of the films will not be disappointed. Hardcore
Tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by
Jackson and the other writers, however, it is unrealistic to expect a
completely true adaptation of the novels, being that film is an entirely
different medium. Despite the alterations, Jackson consistently stays true
to the major themes and ideas from the original text, while adding some of
the finest filmmaking ever put to screen. `The Lord of the Rings: The
Return
of the King' is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect
films
ever made. Not only the best of the trilogy, but a crowning achievement in
epic filmmaking.    
<|_=00=_|>
I am, I admit, an unlikely convert to the religion of Tolkienism. I 
have never read the books, having, I thought, been put off them for 
life by the sort of obsessive freaks who read them when I was at 
school. (One classmate, then aged about sixteen, told me with great 
pride that he had read the whole of 'The Lord of the Rings' at least 
fifty times). I also have never been a great admirer of the 'sword and 
sorcery' school of fantasy writing or film-making; indeed, some of this 
genre (mostly those starring the current governor of California) struck 
me as being among the worst films ever made.

I was, however, persuaded to see the first in the trilogy, 'The 
Fellowship of the Ring', by its overwhelmingly positive reception from 
the critics, and was quickly won over by the scope of Peter Jackson's 
vision. I had been expecting some twee tale of elves, gnomes and 
fairies; what I experienced was a genuine epic (in the true sense of 
that overused word). Ever since December 2001, I have been waiting for 
parts two and three of the trilogy to be released. Neither has 
disappointed me.

The story of 'The Lord of the Rings' is too complex to be told in a 
review such as this. Suffice it to say that it revolves around a magic 
ring which will give its possessor immense power. The power-hungry Dark 
Lord Sauron (a figure who is never actually seen on screen) desires to 
obtain the ring in order to dominate Middle Earth. His enemies, led by 
the wizard Gandalf, are seeking to destroy the ring, which can only be 
used for evil purposes, not for good. At the beginning of the final 
part of the trilogy, Sauron's forces are massing for an attack on the 
kingdom of Gondor.

The film relates the story of the conflict which follows, and this 
leads to some of the most spectacular battle sequences I have seen, 
even more impressive than those in 'The Two Towers'. Inevitably, the 
film makes much use of computer-generated effects, but unlike many 
films dominated by special effects, plot and character are not 
neglected. The acting is uniformly good, and in some cases outstanding. 
Special mentions must also go to the camera-work, which made the best 
possible use of the magnificent New Zealand scenery, and to Howard 
Shore's memorable musical score.

So, looking forward to the Oscar ceremony, I have no doubt that this 
should be the best film and that Peter Jackson, who has amply fulfilled 
the promise shown in the excellent 'Heavenly Creatures', should be best 
director. Best Actor? I would find it difficult to decide between the 
competing claims of Sir Ian McKellen, who brings wisdom, kindliness and 
the required touch of steel to his portrait of Gandalf, and of Elijah 
Wood, who plays the brave and resourceful hobbit Frodo to whom falls 
the dangerous task of ensuring the ring's destruction. Best Supporting 
Actor? My own nomination would be for Sean Astin, as Frodo's loyal 
companion Sam, but several others might have claims, notably Viggo 
Mortensen or Bernard Hill.

Is this the best movie ever made, as some of its admirers have claimed? 
Possibly not- that is, after all, a very large claim to make. I have no 
doubt, however, that the trilogy as a whole is the first great 
cinematic masterpiece of the twenty-first century. It has certainly 
inspired me to start reading Tolkien's original novels. 10/10.
<|_=00=_|>

As a movie watcher, I tend to become bored with the constant, overdone,
overdrawn, underplayed, overdramatized performance and production quality
of
most Hollywood films. It's a trait that in recent years has sadly driven
me
away from most big budget American films. A decent idea will become
mangled
by the money making machine that is Hollywood, hoping to pump the most
raw
cash they can out of it before it drops dead in the street.

We all saw the catastophre of a failure that arose from the Matrix
Franchise. Such immense hype and professed genius only made the failure
all
the more poignant for those of us that really wanted and expected more
from
the franchise.

That all being said, I must say that The Lord of the Rings is an
amazingly
powerful visual experience. Not even just a visual experience. Peter
Jackson
has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into THE
quintessential epic. He supplements the brilliant storytelling of JRR
Tolkien with one of the most awe-inspiring collection of films ever
created.

The 7 hours of film that leads up to the Return of the King is only
precursor though, when you sit and watch this film. It's just plain
brilliance. Everything about the film is wonderful. The manner in which
Jackson has arranged the scenes, detracting slightly from the original
flow
of the novel really helps to keep the suspense strong in all three story
branches. The Tolkien humor is intact perfectly and the gallantry and
just
plain coolness of these heroes is plain amazing. (Check out Legolas in
the
BIG battle) It's all just too much for words.

If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that
one
cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time
here. I personally believe that this is the only way such a film could be
made, true to the source material and completely engrossing, but I found
myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional
final
minutes after 4 hours (including ads and previews) that I had spent in a
cramped seat. As such, this will be all the better (at least for me) when
it's release on DVD (can't wait for the extended...get to see the
Sauroman
scenes that they cut out).

As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling
and now cinema. Bravo Mr. Jackson.
<|_=00=_|>
Obviously, I'm aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is
actually one giant movie, but since it was released in parts, that's
how I'm judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and
since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a
little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.

At this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters,
and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their
knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting
weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can
honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the
edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites
including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic
that it is sure to stay for decades to come.

This is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that
seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo
did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an
incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the
battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad
emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the
extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson
gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.

These were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best,
in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An
absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal
appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm
one of them.

Sorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I
really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but
generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will
never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing.

My rating: 10/10
<|_=00=_|>

Frodo and Sam continue their quest to destroy the ring, led by the
untrustworthy Gollum.  Meanwhile the rest of the Fellowship prepare for
another battle to hold a human city against an onslaught of
orcs.

If you check my other reviews you will note that I wasn't a massive fan
of
the first two films - I loved them, but was not blind to their faults.
However, let me just lay my cards out here, I was totally blown away by
this
film.  For the vast majority (and more of that later) the narrative
flowed
really well where the other two films had struggled to really keep
consistent.  Here the various strands work well together and, while
characters have only brief times to tell stories, on the whole it manages
it
well.  I got the feeling that the film really let rip - it knew this was
the
ending and it did feel that everything came together in a collection of
noise and energy which really made it feel like the final part of a
trilogy
rather than just a stand alone film.

The one area where the film really stutters (and actually caused people
to
leave the cinema in annoying numbers) is ironically the place where
Jackson
is true to the book, and that's the final 20 minutes.  There is a clear
scene where the film ends, however it then runs for another 20 minutes -
which is a mix of scenes that all fade out like they were the end.  To
Joe
Public (ie me!) I would have been happy not to have all the loose ends
tied
up in the way the book does it - the film should have ended on a high
(with
the King being crowned etc) but instead it seems to crawl to an end in a
way
that is not in line with the momentum of the film (if not the whole
trilogy!)  This problem is minor on the grand scheme of things, but I
would
rather have left the cinema on my high than be made to wonder `when's
this
ending? Is this the end now? Oh, maybe this is it now?' - but I do
understand why it was done this way.

The cast, as they have been all the way, are excellent.  Wood's Frodo
changes well during this film while Astin is touching in his portrayal of
unerring friendship.  Bloom and Rhys-Davis had less to do but came into
their own during the battle scenes - adding both action and the odd comic
touch (`that still counts as one' being accepted by the audience as a
chance
to break the tension).  Mortensen is the title character and serves it
well,
with McKellen also continuing his strong role.  I could list through the
whole cast but I will stick with noting two things.  Firstly, both
Monaghan
and Boyd had bigger and more meaningful roles and rose to them well.
Secondly I continue with my belief from the second film that Serkis is
the
stand out actor of the trilogy.  His Gollum is so much more than an
effect -
he is tragic, fearsome, hateful and funny.  Praise of course goes to the
special effects for making this character tell so much with an expression
but to pretend that the work of the actor is secondary to the character
(as
opposed the look) is foolish.  He deserved one for Two Towers so I hope
an
Oscar goes his way.  It was a shame to not have screen time for Lee but
the
film works well without him and it was a brave move by the
editors.

The special effects do not stand out - and that's a compliment.  Even in
state of the art movies of late I have been aware that I could be
watching a
video game.  Here I only occasionally noticed that things were clear
computer effects, even though the majority of the film was!  This is how
they SHOULD be used - not as a draw in their own right but as part of the
film.  Whether it be the massive battle scenes that are spectacular or
the
animated spider or just the fact that I forget that Gollum is only an
effect, I cannot fault it's use of effects or the sheer visual feast that
is
this film.

I have tried not to gush because there will be plenty of others to do
that
without me joining them, but it is hard to really fault this film.  It is
the strongest of the trilogy and brings it all together really well, it
is
an emotional event more than a film and, if Jackson needs 20 minutes of
slow
closure to finish it to his satisfaction then I can give him that in
return
for all the hours of wonderful cinema that he has given
me.
<|_=00=_|>

This is the final movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and certainly
doesn't disappoint like some other trilogies *coughMatrixcough*. The
three
films had their principal shooting all done at the same time, which
lowers
their overall costs and keeps a good sense of continuity for the
films.

The special effects, first of all, are excellent. While there's a few
little
things (a reversed shot with smoke flowing back into chimneys and
occasional
lighting that's a bit off), by and large they're excellent. The most
impressive thing about them is the sheer scale. This isn't a small or
simple
scene; it often includes thousands of digital characters combined with
filmed actors and action, sweeping landscapes, and dozens of things
happening at once. This is a good reason to see it in theatres; even on
DVD,
there's little details that you can only catch when it's on a massive
screen.

The filming is good, although there are a few evidences of digital
smoothing
and cutting that can nag at the mind and eyes of a picky movie-goer.
There
are a few interesting shots, but most are fairly plain and straight on,
getting the point across without being dazzling. New Zealand's landscapes
provide a great backdrop for everything going on, and there really are
some
beautiful places, especially up in the mountains. I hear land prices are
quite good, what with the orcs warring and everything, so you may want to
look into real estate purchases now.

Sound has been said to make 75% of the emotional impact of any
production.
This is a loud 75%. All the sound effects are very well pulled off, sound
appropriate, and are generally loud. The Nazgul screeching was bordering
on
painful, but in a good way. Most everything has a distinct sound, and
it's
rare that anything feels out of place. In some of the battles, the roof
of
the theatre was shaking. The soundtrack fits the movie well, and Howard
Shore has done an excellent job, as with the last two films in the
series.

Performances all around were good, but Sean Astin as Sam and Viggo
Mortensen
as Aragorn really dominated the film. They performed their roles
perfectly,
and came away giving a good picture of the characters. Elijah Wood seemed
to
be stuck with the same terrified expression on his face through most of
the
movie, almost Max Payne-style, and it grew old quickly. Ian McKellen, the
ever-wise white wizard, had a fair bit of dialogue which he delivered
well;
my only complaint is he had too much in the way of wistful sayings
leading
to scene changes. Orlando Bloom, favorite of young teenage girls
everywhere,
had a few more action sequences (which got cheers from the aforementioned
girls) which were quite well pulled off, but his acting wasn't much
tested
by this film. John Rhys-Davies continued with Gimli's joking performance;
he's really too amusing to take seriously, but does a good job at
it.

For the old Tolkien fans, this movie stays quite close to the book,
although
they did have to omit some portions, most notably the taking and retaking
of
the Shire and the time spent in the Halls of Healing in Minas Tirith.
Hopefully some of this will show up in the Extended Edition on DVD.
Shelob's
attack was left until this film, and much of the time spent in Mordor was
shortened for the sake of pacing, and it was a good decision.

My favorite scene would have to be the battle at Minas Tirith. The
incredible scope of the battle, with the special effects, sounds, and
many
close-ups of pieces of the action, make for an exciting scene. The visual
effects especially are stunning; the 'oliphaunts' play a big part in the
action, and they're entirely created by computer. There's also some wide
shots with tens of thousands of digital characters marching on the field
of
battle, and even the individual actions have the masses warring as a
backdrop. It's worth your movie-going dollar simply to watch this on a
large
screen. It was also intermingled with some smaller events inside Minas
Tirith, so it's not pure battle for the whole of the scene, and it keeps
it
from being dreary or heavy-handed.

Overall, this is a movie well worth watching, and even paying to see in a
theatre. I'd recommend against bringing small children, as there are some
scary images, and they'd also be a distraction during the final movie in
what will probably remain the series of the decade. Not a particularly
great
date movie, either...this is a real, bring-your-friends big movie. Five
out
of five decapitated orcs (and trust me, there were a lot more than
that).
<|_=00=_|>

Feeling weary and battle-worn, I have just staggered out of the cinema
after
three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other
special
effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them -
probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising,
evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure
epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift
effortlessly
between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing
bloodshed,
beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and
cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human
bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the
unassuming credits flash by.

Return of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand
director Peter Jackson. Although I've seen the other two and read the
book,
I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn't done
either.

The storytelling is much more professional that the first one - which
maybe
laboured to introduce so much information - or the second one - which has
little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the
King,
there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation
of
Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie
then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness
of
the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman's
love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship
of
Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin & Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits,
the
strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on
things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and
very
varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the
screen
and provide key plot elements.

This is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques
and
the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's
Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a
fairy
story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before, and is even
unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the
Nasgul
stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the
battles
are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you
can
get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole
narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of
the
original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book
again!)

The worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long - but not
that
you'd notice . . .

***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***

Over the years, I've read Lord of the Rings four times. During the
holiday season of 2003/4, I watched Return of the King four times.
While I embraced ROTK as the third part of a dream come true, I was not
totally happy, left wondering why so many things vital were missing.
The 4-hour extended DVD version explains a lot.

My biggest beef was on so much missing about Aragon, and I found most
of them in the DVD. One of the vital elements in the Fellowship's
strategy is to draw Sauron's eye away from Frodo, and here Aragon's
role is crucial. The "last debate" in the movie is totally inadequate
in explaining the suicidal march to the Black gate but the DVD makes it
very clear, with the additional scene of Aragon revealing himself to
Sauron though the Palantir. He is the bait that Sauron cannot resist.

Another important aspect is that Aragon comes into the city of Minas
Tirith first and foremost as a HEALER, not as a king. The kingship
comes afterwards. This is again brought out in the additional scenes in
the DVD, although still missing a lot of details from the book.

Still disappointing, even for the DVD, is that so little is given to
the story of Eowyn and Faramir. The dialogue through which they come to
accept each other could very well be the most beautiful in the entire
book. The few shots in the DVD that trace the development of their
relationship are far from adequate, although that's a least a slight
improvement from the film version.

Another disappointment is Aragon's arrival at the Pelennor Fields,
which is hopelessly lame compared with the original treatment in the
book: amidst the despair of the Rohan and Gondor soldiers in witnessing
the approaching black ships, Aragon's standard suddenly unfurls at the
main mast: "There flowered a White Tree, and that was for Gondor; but
seven stars were about it, and a high crown above it, the signs of
Elendil that no lord had borne for years beyond count. And the stars
flamed in the sunlight, for they were wrought of gems by Arwen daughter
of Elrond; and the crown was bright in the morning, for it was wrought
of mithril gold." 

The treatment of Gandalf's confrontation of the Witch King in the DVD
departs from the book, in which the two are locked in a face off, then
Rohan's horns are heard and the Witch King swings around and leaves.
What in heaven's name is in Peter Jackson's mind when he had Gandalf's
staff broken by the Witch King. But this did explain a mystery that has
been bugging me for a year  why Gandalf had to snatch a spear from the
guard when he saved Faramir from the pyre of Denethor.

Enough on the DVD.I shall be remiss if I do not pay tribute to Peter
Jackson for the wonderful film he and his dedicated crew have created.

Most inspired is the lighting of the beacons to summon help from Rohan.
In the book, this is observed by Pippin in the ride to Minas Tirith. To
satisfy Pippin's curiosity, Gandalf explains the background to him in a
somewhat factual manner. Jackson turns this into one of the most
exciting moments in the film, with aesthetically superb shots of the 13
beacons (yes, I counted them) being lit up in succession, accompanied
by beautifully rousing music score, culminating in Theoden's heroic
utterance of "Rohan will answer". Watching this has to be among the
most uplifting moments one can experience in a cinema.

Most poignant is the Faramir's suicidal attempt to retake Osgilaith,
under the orders of an unloving father. Starting from the soldiers of
Gondor filing out of Minas Tirith in what looks almost like a funeral
march to the letting loose of the swarm of arrows by the orcs in
Osgilaith, every image of this scene is so hauntingly heartrending. It
reminds me of John Woo's favourite scenes, although here, the music is
Pipppin's actual singing rather than adapted background music,
rendering the tragic mood even more devastating.

Directly opposite in mood is Rohan's charge in the Battle of Pelennor
Fields. Even if this mission is, in a way, equally suicidal, the spirit
is sky high, radiating dauntless heroism and lust for battle. This
scene also reminds me of the legendary battle scene in Spartacus (1960)
which is universally recognised as the model in depiction of battle
strategies. Rohan's charge in Pelennor Field, no the other hand,
exemplifies heroism unsurpassed.

Although ROTK is first and foremost the King's story, we should not
forget, in the overall scheme of things, the ring bearers (no typo here
because Frodo did acknowledge Sam as a fellow ring bearer in the end of
the book). Elijah Wood and Sean Astin (particularly Astin) have played
their roles to perfection. Towards the end of the quest, when Frodo's
strength was almost fully spent, to hear Sam say "I cannot carry it
(the ring) for you, Mr. Frodo, but I can carry you" and not be moved,
one will have to be a hopelessly and irreversibly hardened cynic. The
background music, incidentally, is "Into the west".

It is certainly a good sign that the general audience worldwide has
reacted favourably to the long aftermath following the destruction of
the ring, indicated that their capacity to appreciate has not been
impaired by the proliferation of Hollywood style slam-bang endings.
Viggo Mortensen's line to the Hobbits "My friends, you bow to no one"
is delivered with sincerity and conviction. The final scene at the Grey
Havens is graceful, touching, stylish. However, there is one shot that
I must mention: Galadriel's final enigmatic, alluring, half-smiling
glance at Frodo before she disappears into the ship. Cate Blanchett is
among the most versatile actresses around today and in LOTR, she is
Galadriel incarnate.

Just as Peter Jackson felt that LOTR had to be made as one large,
three-part, cinematic piece, I decided to write my IMDb review of all
three movies as a single, multi-part essay. Click on my screen-name and
hit "Chronological" to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two
Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my
review, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and
very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting,
cinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat.

Which of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood  and the
same holds true for Tolkien's books. When I am immersed in the story,
ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole
experience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense,
evocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers.

Frodo, Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies,
nerves, and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle
earth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas
Tirith, and preparing for even more deadly battles to come.

The heroism and romance are incredibly moving - when was the last time
you saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie
rubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking - even moreso than in the
previous two films.

The casting and acting are superb.

The film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy's
well-earned crown.

Return of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs
in LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy, however, you may be able
to predict some of what will occur, but never all of it and you'll
never guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and
paradoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien's grand plots is present
throughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK, however, is the
varied ways and means of heroism  both intentional and unintended, and
Tolkien's examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is
subtle. Amazingly, it all comes through in the films.

Even more than the previous two films, Jackson and his writers took
liberties with the story-line. Like the others, however, this serves
the film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By
reordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices
which are consistent with Tolkien's world and characterizations, the
film-makers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and
themes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The
lengthy epilogue in Tolkien's book is greatly reduced, reordered, and
somewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually
appear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien's epilogue are
disclosed in the Two Towers, though not directly depicted. But all of
the really important components of the epilogue are, at least strongly
implied if not well illustrated in ROTK.
