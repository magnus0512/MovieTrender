Here's a very funny spoof on The Godfather story. This is a Leslie
Nielsen-type silly parody, except the late Lloyd Bridges played the
lead role instead Nielson.

Actually Jay Mohr was more of the lead actor in here, narrating the
film and taking Al Pacino's Godfather role while Christina Applegate
took Diane Keaton's character. 

There are a number of laugh-out-loud lines in this movie and a number
of overdone slapstick scenes. As with any comedy in which the material
comes at you at a rapid pace (see the Marx Brothers films from 70 years
ago to see some of the origins of comedic mayhem), you get a lot funny
and not-so-funny. They come at you so fast you can hardly keep up. I
found that there were a lot of funny lines written on background
buildings, street signs, etc. on this film. You almost have to
freeze-frame some scenes to "read" all the jokes, much less hear them.

This movie did do something that Hollywood films rarely have done: poke
fun at a Democrat. Usually, the cheap shots are reserved for
Republcians (Nixon, Gingrich, Reagan, Bush, etc) but here we have the
famous "But I never had sex with that woman!" line delivered in a
obvious reference. Well, good for them. About time the Liberals were
recipients of a cheap shot or two. It only happens about once every 25
years in films. So, I give this film points for being "fair and
balanced."

Also points should be awarded for having several actors from the actual
Godfather films make appearances here, too. The film was dedicated "in
loving memory" to Bridges, so I assume this was his last movie. Well,
he certainly went out with a laugh.

While many reviewers gave this film mild or bad reviews, they all seem to
miss the attention to detail -- the artistic attempt not only to recreate
the look and atmosphere of THE GODFATHER, but also the look of the periods
depicted.
 
I found the film delightful. I was expecting what I got -- a spoof from the
AIRPLANE folks. They didn't promise Shakespeare so don't expect iambic
pentameter.

It certainly took a long time to get to see the first spoof on the ever-so
-serious mafia flicks! However, it was worth the wait - Jim Abrahams has
 certainly not lost his touch. Although there is an abundant number of
 really bad jokes in the picture, and many times you've heard them before 
(in Airplane!, Naked Gun etc.), one cannot help but like it. For one thing,
 Mafia! looks fabulous (especially the Sicilian scenes). At times sparks
 really fly in terms of funny dialogue and character interaction - I
 especially enjoyed Christina Applegate's 'presidential' performance.
 Although Lloyd Bridges will be fondly remembered (and missed), I would have
 preferred to see Leslie Nielsen in Don Cortino's role.

Jim Abrahams, the director of "Jane Austen's Mafia", is a man that
knows a thing, or two, about what to give the public as he has already
shown in his acerbic satires. This one, came without any warning the
other night and frankly, either we were in a giddy mood, or we were
ready to laugh looking at this spoof on the different Godfathers films,
as well as others, most notably, Goodfellas and Casino. Francis Ford
Coppola and Martin Scorsese might have laughed at seeing some of the
material they directed seen in a different light.

The casting was excellent. LLoyd Bridges, for whom the film is
dedicated, gives a great performance as the older Vincenzo Cortino. Jay
Mohr as the younger Cortino is good. The same can be said for the rest
of the cast that do some amazing funny turns.

The only suggestion is to stay tuned to the credits because of the
funny lines in between the names of the people involved in this film.
If you're in a mood for fun and want to see some light fare, this is
the film for you.

Jim Abrahams has written several of my favorite fast-paced comedies,
like "Hot Shots" and "The Naked Gun", and of course my favorite
"Airplane!". This was the first movie that i felt it was obvious he was
losing his touch. The comedy is not as fast-paced here as it was
before, nor is it as spot-on. Spoofing the "Godfather"-movies shouldn't
be very hard really. Those movies are as potentially silly as great
movies always are, walking the thin line that greatness is.

The problem here is that i think they missed so many things that could
have been spoofed, and they included some things that didn't need
spoofing. The best part of the movie in my opinion is the one with the
young Cortino coming to America. The more contemporary parts are less
funny and more silly. Mostly i find it to be a lack in the script
department as both Lloyd Bridges and Jay Mohr are pretty suitable for
their parts.

In the end this is about 50 percent embarrassing and 50 percent funny,
much like many of Leslie Nielsens later movies. It's far from "Hot
Shots" and "Naked Gun" but then again such comedy is not what it was.

This film is a nice tribute to the late (great) Lloyd Bridges in his final
role as the main Don Conrtino (he keeps mixing it up though) who must pass
on his business (mob) to his son Tony (played hilariously by Jay Mohr).  A
great spoof as always coming from ZAZ man (A man actually) Jim Abrahams who
casts Bridges for the 5th time.  He also brings to the screen zany yet funny
parodies of films (gnagster in general) including- GoodFellas, Casino, The
Godfather Trilogy, Jaws, Jurassic Park 1 & 2, and countless others.  Plenty
of gags and two great performances save this film from plot destruction. 
One of the funniest spoofs ever.  A+

Young Vincenzo Cortino, son of a Sicilian postman, delivers a package
for his father and accidentally sees something he should not see. In a
donkey's, well, he is smuggled out of town, where he tries to reach a
ship headed for America. There, Vincenzo works his way up to the top of
the Mafia. One day, his youngest son makes a mistake and has to leave
town. A little later, he ends up as a casino boss in Las Vegas. But the
heads of the other families want old Don Cortino out of the way. So,
they shoot him 47 times and send a *very* attractive woman to distract
his son from his casino work. Will he fall for her or will he return to
Diane, who, by the way, had run for President successfully in the
meantime? Not every joke works, but many of them are indeed quite
hilarious. If you liked Jim Abrahams previous films, i.e. Hot Shots
1&2, you'll probably like this film. It spoofs everything from "The
Godfather", to "Jurassic park 2", to "Forrest gump". It was also
entertaining watching many people who were IN the Godfather spoofing
they're own characters! My rating for "Mafia!"--8/10.

ABOUT THE DVD: Touchstone has released a reasonable DVD for the film.
The image is presented in 1.85:1 and generally isn't a bad picture but
has a surprisingly high amount of grain and dirt (This is especially
obvious during darker sequences) but the picture is sharp,colors are
good, and blacks are solid. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is as fine as I
could have hoped for. Audio is crystal clear and there's plenty of
surround sound effects to keep your rear speakers occupied. For extras
we are given a tiny production featurette, which consist of cast
interviews, film clips, and some behind-the-scene footage. This
featurette runs a little less than 2 minutes. The disk is adequately
closed-captioned with substantial paraphrasing. My rating for the DVD:
7.5/10.

More comedy than I expected.  The one liners were hilarious.  It had its
stupid parts, but so stupid you had to laugh at the stupidity.
<|_=00=_|>

A worthwhile spoof of gangster movies (especially the godfather and casino)
with several really funny scenes that will keep you laughing. I enjoyed this
when I saw it and would recommend it. Good script and good
performances.

** 1/2 out of ****

Wow!  You'd think by now Jim Abraham's material would be worn out and
unoriginal.  Think again.  MAFIA! has got to be among one of the funniest
parody films of the 1990s.  This movie had me laughing for hours after I
saw
it, and even now when I think of some of the gags (especially the games in
the casino) I can't help but to crack up.  Also, the acting is BRILLIANT.
Kudos to everyone who starred in the film!  They all pulled off the
ludicrously hilarious gags and delivered the most funny lines while keeping
a straight face the entire time.  I could never do that.
