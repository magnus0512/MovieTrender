Stella gets her groove back, alright, but the film is still in need by the
time you get to the end credits. Angela Bassett gives a kick-ass
performance
in the title role as a fortysomething woman who can't decide what to do
when
she falls in love with twenty-one year-old Taye Diggs while on vacation at
a
resort in Jamaica. Do 'im is what I say: if a woman like Bassett looks
that
good at the age of forty she deserves the best of everything. Besides,
Diggs
doesn't look nearly young enough for the part, and that keeps reality at
bay
for the two and some odd hours that the film runs at. The scene where
teenage girls get in line behind the couple at a movie theatre and give
Stella dirty looks for robbing the cradle always puzzles me; if I were
that
young an age and found myself standing behind Angela Bassett I'd be asking
her what kind of skin creams does she use and does she work out and maybe
there might be a portrait hidden in her attic that has all her sins
hanging
off it? Whoopi Goldberg gives the best and funniest performance in the
film,
but even she can't prevent the script by Ronald Bass and Terry McMillan
(upon whose novel this is based) from seeming like it's two or three
drafts
short of being finished. Watch it if only for a great soundtrack and some
beautiful photography of Jamaica's beaches.

Angela Bassett ("Waiting to Exhale") is talented and buff as Stella, a
single mother/career woman who's in need of a vacation.  Stella decides to
head for Jamaica with her best friend, Delilah (Whoopi Goldberg in a fine
supporting role).  Stella meets 20-year-old Winston (Taye Diggs).  They fall
in love, in-spite of Stella's emotional insecurities.  Terry McMillan
adapted from her novel based on her real-life experience.  I hate to say
this, but unlike "Waiting to Exhale," this overlong movie barely holds up to
the book, because of too many plot holes and too many unnecessary
characters.  On the contrary, Diggs turns in an impressive performance as
well.  My evaluation: ** out of ****. 
<|_=00=_|>

On a rainy, dreary day recently I popped this movie in looking for light
and comedic entertainment.  I was disappointed.  The movie starts with
Stella in a bad mood, with a magnificent job and a home that I noticed was
so nice, it had a reflecting pool.  I watched as Stella moaned and
complained about her ex, her job, her life, ad nauseum.  Angela Bassett's
portrayal of Stella was one of anger however I admired her buff physique,
left over from her Tina Turner portrayal which was excellent.  So I tried
to
find sympathy for Stella.  However, the director never gave we, the
viewers,
any reason or background to feel any sorrow or empathy for Stella.  She
had
it all.  When Stella takes her vacation to Jamaica and meets William
Shakespeare (Taye Diggs), it was hard to work up any enthusiasm because
she
was so angry, angry at the world.  However, the scenery in the film was
breathtaking and the age difference between the two seemed a bit much but
did not interfere with what could have been a great love story.  It
bothered
Stella more than it did me.  Still Stella remained ungrooved.

Caution ***Movie Spoiler***  Upon returning home from a dream vacation,
Stella loses her job and upon the advice of her good friend Delilah
(Whoopi
Goldberg), goes back to Jamaica which told me that losing her job did not
affect her high-flying lifestyle.  If only Stella appreciated her
circumstances as much as I did.  In summary, I saw Stella as not having a
"groove" and Bassett carried her character through the movie with such
anger, I felt myself recoiling from her verbal barbs and angry displays
toward William, his parents, and all those around her.  Only when she
finds
out Delilah's secret, does she drop the angry attitude and pity party to
help someone else.  Because we were never given a reason to feel any
compassion or sympathy with Stella, it is my opinion that Stella Never Had
a
Groove to get back.   Bassett stomped her way through this role as if Ike
were chasing her in that other movie; and I would have much rather had
more
access to Delilah's world.  Taye Diggs did what he does best which is to
look great. All in all, How Stella Got Her Groove Back is less that what I
expect from actress Angela Bassett.
<|_=00=_|>
Angela Bassett does an outstanding job. To those of you who can't
understand why Stella needs her groove back, you have only to look up
the word mundane. No matter how much money you have or Chanel suits you
own that doesn't mean you have true companionship. We all want a real
connection someone to hold us, love us and tell us it will get better.
And that transcends age and socio economics. Sometimes people are right
on time. No one can go through the world completely alone. We never
know what or how long any relationship will last so I suppose the most
important thing is to seize the day. Make your own reality and Stella
does that with dignity and with pride and admittedly with hesitation
and fear. That's the sign of a very real character! Someone who is
vulnerable. Someone you can understand even if you're not in the same
situation.

Stella pushed the envelope-- and in that, if only that, it has merit.  By
showing that an all black cast can attract a wider audience (and
interestingly, it's usually white folks who don't like the movie.. one
begins to wonder why?) and a black actress, Angela Bassett, prodigiously
talented, brilliant, and as a bonus, beautiful, can convincingly portray a
woman who is torn between what she has always been taught is right, and
what
her heart is telling her is right.. is a timeless story.

Add to that the crackling comic relief of Whoopi Goldberg, and two very
funny sisters representing opposing views and lifestyles, and you have a
nice mix.  More envelope pushing?  One of the sisters is married to a
white
guy -- nothing is made of it, it just is.  The point made, of course, is
that interracial marriage isn't something odd or different or in need of
explanation or commentary.  One of the better ways to attack
institutionalized racism, racism that is bred into us as we grow up, is to
show images that combat those assumptions and to make those images as
nonchalant and matter of fact as possible.  This was done very well in
Stella.

Of course, if one doesn't like romantic comedy, or if one nurses
prejudice,
consciously or subconsciously, the movie won't be appealing.

I, however, found it charming, funny, enjoyable, and delightful. I loved
Angela Bassett's performance, I am in awe of her talent and her beauty
(yes,
a woman can appreciate another woman's beauty.. we need not attack each
other, we can be sisters, can we not?) and I loved Whoopi Goldberg's comic
relief.  Taye Diggs?  Well, we shall see.  He's certainly easy on the eye,
and he did a credible job with his role.  I'd like to see him in more
before
I decide if he's good, great, or somewhere in between.  Based solely on
Stella, I think he's good, and very promising.

The movie did not track the book as much as I would have liked -- I don't
want to say in what ways because I don't want to ruin it for those of you
who are going to go and read the book.

Do read the book if you haven't -- it's excellent, wonderful reading.  My
favorite, in fact, of Terry McMillan's work.

Another point; Stella is depicted a stock broker.  Some found that to lack
credibility.  Why?  Are those folks trying to suggest that there are no
women or black women stock brokers?  I can tell you that there are, and
introduce you to a few if you'd like -- I know several of them.  And
money?
Yes, there actually are well to do, single, black, mothers who are
professionals in a number of fields including law, medicine, academia,
business, government -- everywhere.  Not enough, but they're there, and
they're forging the way for more to come.

Someone else said that it wasn't credible that the Winston character would
fall so quickly in love with the Stella character.  Why not?  Stella was
portrayed as beautiful, intriguing, very intelligent, she looked no older
than 25 -- why would a 20 year old not want to be with a woman like that?
Why would any man not want to be with someone like that?  Of course it was
credible.

The movie was humorous (remember Ms. Thang "How nice that you're visiting
with your mother."  rofl, that was hysterical..  "oh yes, I've missed my
mother very much"..  (pause)(wicked grins followed by a long kiss that had
nothing maternal about it) .. as Ms. Thang flounces away, having received
her comeuppence very nicely.  I guffawed and loved it.

I'm truly mystified by those who didn't like the movie.  I admit to its
flaws, and the fact that it didn't track the book in some ways.. but it
had
so very much going for it.. everything from the envelope pushing of
interracial marriage, and the age difference.. where usually it is the man
who is older and professional, and the woman who is younger, and no one
finds that odd or different.   How many men are married to women 20, 30,
years their junior?  Society says nothing about that..  A 20 year
difference?   How often do you see a 45 year old man with a 25 year old
woman?  Every day, everywhere.  It's something that goes without
comment.

Here we have it reversed, and we see how hard it is for the female
character
to break the bonds of that double standard.  But she does.  Isn't that a
role model, a positive break from the typical older male/younger female
scene that we usually see and take in stride as completely acceptable and
quite normal.  Reverse it and everyone gasps.. "Isn't she old enough to be
his MOTHER?!?!"   While the men who are old enough to be their wives'
fathers (and grandfathers) pass without a blink of the eye, without a
comment.

But the social commentary, the envelope pushing -- it was there and it was
good, but the movie's humor, the love story, the laughter.. that's what
made
the movie great fun.  It could have just won points on social commentary,
but it didn't.. it won them on purely cinematic/acting grounds.  The fact
that it also contained social commentary was simply a huge bonus.. and we
know that psychologically, folks are more likely to absorb social
commentary
when it is presented in a way that isn't a polemic, a lecture, a
heavy-handed "after school special."

My vote..  On the book- 9/10
On the movie 8/9 or better.

Comments on this overly long review?
 > I don't usually come back to see how my comments are
received.  Flame mail?  Please don't, because it's a negative waste of
time.. but real discussion I always welcome, whether the other person
agrees
or disagrees, as long as the issue is discussed, and personal attacks are
not made.

Someone suggested watching White Palace, and said that it is the same
story,
but grittier, with Susan Sarandon (a great actress) and James Spader.  I
think I'll rent that next ;)

Picture if you will, Stella (Angela Bassett). She's single...she's
rich...she's got a great job--but, alas, no "on paper" man in her life
that will make her feel complete. So, she goes off to Jamaica with her
oldest and dearest friend (Whoopi Goldberg) in desperate search of her
"groove." In the land of sand and sunlight, she happens upon Winston
Shakespeare (Taye Diggs), who is half her age and finer than frog hair,
and she is in a dilemma about exactly how she should handle the
situation. I wish I had her problems, trust me.

If I were Stella and had someone like Winston chasing after me, I'd be
on him faster than a duck on a june bug...however, practical Stella is
all caught up on the age thing...is anyone still with me? He's hot,
he's young, and he's after me, and I'm going to QUESTION that? My first
question would be where do we put the furniture, but, no--it takes the
death of a good friend to make her embrace the fact that she should
give into something as, uh-hem, debatable as Taye Diggs...OK, ladies,
are you with me? In unison--"GIVE ME A BREAK!" If you're still on the
fence, rewind and watch that pool scene again. I'm waiting. OK--now,
we're all on the same page.

This premise is flawed as flawed can be. I don't care if she has a
child--any woman with a child should have her thinking cap firmly in
place atop her head to know if he was a true, purebred dog, you'd have
known it by the next morning, and still wow your girlfriends with the
tale. He has been nothing but gallant, and yet we're supposed to
sympathize with her...I don't think so.

Stella creates her own drama while most of us would have been riding
off into the sunset. In the end, the Terry McMillan autobiographical
version didn't go EXACTLY as planned, but, hey, in a perfect world
Stella had it going on from the get go. The "groove" could be, and in
the movie was, reaffirmed in the shower. If my only problem is we don't
like the same movies, I can assure you I would have forgotten about it
by the first shower scene. But, if having to see Regina King made it
all work out, I'm all for it. She's great as always.
<|_=00=_|>
The first time I saw this movie I wanted to immediately hop a plane to
Jamaica! I don't think it was the "meet the man of my dreams" part, but
the scenery. It was just breathtaking (although the men aren't too bad
to look at either!). As for the story, it was a good distraction from
typical reality, because, let's face it ladies, we believe that doesn't
happen everyday (especially to ourselves). The soundtrack was another
good part of the movie, I just loved it. This movie is the kind that
gives you hope for true romantic love, but in this cynical day and age
most people don't let themselves be pulled in, or fooled, by the
seemingly unrealistic situation. For those of us with a little romance
still left, this is a wonderful movie. For those without, I'm sorry.
(These are my thoughts excluding the latest headlines, I don't want to
spoil my original feeling toward the movie).
<|_=00=_|>

Angela Bassett delivers another wonderful performance (is she not one of the
greatest actors of out time?), but unfortunately, it's not enough to raise
this movie to the level of greatness I expected from it.

There's no doubt, the film is beautiful to look at and the performances are
good all around. But the script is lacking that certain something that makes
you believe the whys and hows. We can certainly understand why Stella fell
in love with that 20 year old--he's gorgeous, sincere and very mature for
his age. But the crucial information we're missing is why he falls for her.

He approaches her because of her physcial beauty, but stays for an unknown
reason. Why WOULD a 20 year old be so willing to pursue a woman twice his
age after a casual meeting? Why is he so mature and understanding at such a
young age? We'll never know and that's what kept me from believing this
film.

Another problem is the seemingly pointless demise of one of the characters
(I won't say who). This event didn't carry the story forward and acted more
as a detractor from the plot that anything else. It should have been used to
help the other characters develop, but it instead that little subplot
dissolved into oblivion.

Overall, I would certainly recommend Stella. It was an enjoyable and sincere
story. But it could have been so much better.
<|_=00=_|>

Have you ever noticed how the excuses for seeing a really bad movie have
an
eerie similarity to the excuses for adultery? I didn't really intend to
see
it, it just sort of happened, I never really wanted to, but I was parked
in
front of the TV and there it was. I thought it might be okay. I was wrong.

It is unclear to me why anyone thinks that Stella (Angela Basset) lost her
groove in the first place. Stella is rich, successful, unbelievably
beautiful, smart, independent, and a fashion plate. We open with her
dancing
and grooving to the radio, yet we are expected to believe she needs her
groove back.

It only gets worse from there. I don't want to talk about it.
2/10

Angela Bassett was, of course, well-known by the time she made this
film, and here she proved once again why she is one of America's better
actresses. But the real story here was the film debut of Taye Diggs. As
an old white guy, I first saw this film when it premiered on cable, and
I thought Diggs was certain to become a popular actor. Now, 25 films
later, not to mention an active career on prime time television, Diggs
has become just that -- a fine and respected actor with a captivating
on-screen persona that just always seems to work.

Here it's the 21 year old Jamaican fellow who seduces (and I mean that
in the best sense) the 40 year old businesswoman from San Francisco.
The romance sizzles, despite reservations, while Whoopi Goldberg
provides a bit of light-hearted comedy. The question, of course, is
whether the age difference will divide two people in love. And the film
does keep you guessing as to which possible ending it will be.

Diggs' character's last name here is Shakepeare, and while this film
hardly reaches the level of a Shakespearean tale, it's engaging,
romantic, and great fun. But that doesn't mean it's all love and roses.
True love never is, and meanwhile Whoopi's character is dying. So this
is not just another feel good movie; there's some drama here, including
making a relationship with a diversity of ages work.

I give this film much higher marks than the overall rating here. It's
easily worth a "7".
