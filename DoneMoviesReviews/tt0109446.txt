'The Client' is perhaps one of the many films that won't be enjoyed as
much after one has read the book. I, having not read John Grisham's
novel, quite enjoyed it. Sure the movie has its flaws in the form of
plot holes, caricatures, obvious clichés etc, but it essentially
manages to keep the viewer engaged. 'The Client' is further backed up
by strong performances. Susan Sarandon makes full use of her powerful
screen presence and easily stands out. No wonder she's an exceptional
actress. Reggie Love is one of her most memorable performances (among
the so many she's already given). The late Brad Renfro, as the young
Sway, is very competent and does impress in several scenes. Tommy Lee
Jones is funny (both intentionally and unintentionally). From the
supporting cast, Mary-Louise Parker leaves a mark. William H. Macy
barely has more than a few lines but has a dignified presence. The
villains both look and act like caricatures. In a nutshell, it's an
interesting film with a flawed but gripping plot and marvelous
performances.

Susan Sarandon should stick with the tough 
minded lawyer more often. Perfectly cast in 
the role of Reggie Love, she brings a certain 
charm to a role which could have lacked in 
that department. And to make matters even 
tougher on her, she was almost outshined 
by Brad Renfro, who made quite an impression 
in a film such as this. While the film was put 
together in a rather conventional way, with 
Tommy Lee Jones playing an over clichéd 
character, the film is still rather gripping. A 
decent film to have in your collection, and 
one of the better John Grisham book-turned-movie 
adaptations.

Wow, what a cast! And they all deliver the goods too. Susan Sarandon is
an exceptional actress. Watch the scene in "Dead Man Walking" when she
visits the family of one of the victims. She doesn't just sit quietly.
She actively "listens" to them. And Tommy Lee Jones uncovers the comic
side of his dashing political lawyer. Even the eleven-year-old kid
gives a spot on performance, anything but cute, which is a relief. The
smaller roles are equally well done although there is less to be done
well. J. T. Walsh is always good. Mary-Louise Parker never makes a
wrong move as the stressed-out mother. Ossie Davis is a monumental
presence as the judge. Bill Macy is given only a few lines.

The script isn't bad either, especially in the first half of the film,
in which the characters are being established. There are, alas, three
clichés.

The bad guys LOOK like move bad guys usually look. They dress in black,
have long greasy hair, are engraved with threatening jailhouse tattoos
of barbed wire and things, and they never seem to enjoy themselves.

There are also two stereotypical scenes which really should have been
avoided. In the first, the boy, Renfro, is trying to sneak out of a
hospital. He pokes his face through a door into the reception room,
where he sees his mother and two cops walking around. In the shadows he
also spots the man he knows is trying to murder him. So what does he
do? Does he run to his Mom and the police for protection? Certainly
not. He does what aay potential murder victim would do. He dashes away
from safety, down several flights of an empty stairway, followed
closely by the squinter with a knife. The scene that follows is lifted
straight out of "Coma," with the killer being locked in a refrigerator. 

The other stereotyped situation is towards the end, when (just by the
most improbable of coincidences) Sarandon and Renfro reach an empty
boat house at the same time as three of the heavies. The two innocents
try to avoid being discovered. There is a lot of tiptoeing around on
creaky boards, a foot chase through some bushes, one of those scenes in
which one person holds a gun on a second, and the second smiles and
says, "You don't have the guts to pull the trigger," and walks up
closer to the muzzle.

I've pointed out these weaknesses not because this is a bad movie. It's
really pretty good. But the cast is so outstanding that any weakness in
the story is the more highly illuminated. 

See it, if only to see the range of facial expressions into which Jones
is able to fashion his face.

   ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***
This movie is completely formulaic, melodramatic, and contrived.  Everyone
but William H. Macy overacts to the point of charicature, which is
appropriate, since the film is a charicature of its genre.

To be specific, I think the movie fails on 3 fronts:

1) The plot is rife with logical nonsequiturs.  At the very core, the
entire
basis for the movie falls apart with any scrutiny.  The kid is only a
threat
to the mob if he DOESN'T talk - once he talks, the damage is done, and
he's
of no interest to the mob (I don't think the mob kills kids for telling
the
cops what they know!).  So, to protect himself, the first thing he would
do
is squeal.  Even ignoring the big plot lapse, there are several aspects
that
leave you scratching your head, like why is it that the DA, who's trying
to
convict the mob assassin, is the BAD GUY in this?  Why is the kid so mad
at
his lawyer?  Why did the kid break out of jail - it was the only place he
was safe!  These nagging questions just go on and on as you watch this
movie.

2)  The actors overact.  In the case of Tommy Lee Jones,he does a great
job
in creating a slick, manipulative DA (see above), but it is so cliche, as
to
be cartoonish.  Susan Sarandon does a good job, also, but it's not really
a
role that should have been oscar-nomination material - aside from her past
life troubles, there's not much there for her character.  My complaint
with
her is that her character is, again, cliche.  The most egregious bit of
overacting belongs to Brad Renfroe, though I blame the director.  As
opposed
to sympathizing with him, his yelling and cursing tantrums made me want to
slap him.  He was way over the top.

3)  The movie was sheer formula; predictable, familiar.  Little kid takes
on
the evil and/or incompetent adults - and, of course, wins.  Throw in the
rediculously cliche mob wiseguy, the slick media-savvy DA, the
good-hearted,
smart-as-a-whip, beautiful female attorney, the wise, self-confident
unflappable southern judge (black, for good measure), and the secretly
menacing cop, and voila!  It's basically a 60's Disney movie on steroids.
The cute, snappy repartee between the lawyer and the DA, wherein the
(female, of course) 2-years-out-of-law-school domestic relations lawyer
goes
toe-to-toe and holds her own with the powerful, iron-fisted DA, typifies
this movie.

Judging by the vast majority of other comments, I can see that most people
weren't as put off by this rather typical John Grisham-Hollywood
concoction
as I, so it must be entertaining to a large audience, but please don't
confuse it with good cinema.
<|_=00=_|>

Back in 1994, I read this book and just like other John Grisham's novels,
with the exception of "The Pelican Brief", once I started reading, I
couldn't put it down.

Director Joel Schumacher and Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman did an excellent
job keeping the movie within the storyline without doing a horrible "hatchet
job" most do to novels. 

In addition, there was an excellent flow to the movie.  It kept moving
along;  There wasn't very many slow moments in it and it kept me on the edge
of my seat.

The casting was great as well.  I liked Susan Sarandon as Reggie Love, Brad
Renfro as Mark Sway, Tommy Lee Jones was a perfect fit as the "Revered" Roy
Foltrigg.  Will Patton as Sergent Hardy, was an excellent sleezy and
conniving officer.

When I saw Anthony LaPaglia as Barry "The Blade" Muldano, I didn't envision
the greasy sleezeball he portrayed, but someone more tougher or perhaps more
thuggish.  But Anthony LaPaglia fit just fine.  

This is a movie worth renting.

<|_=00=_|>

"The Client" is an enjoyable and well executed thriller overall. While the
directing, script and overall product are far from amazing and sometimes
quite bland, the Oscar level performances compensate for the easily
over-seeable flaws. 

Perhaps the child of the title, Brad Renfro, can be annoying in parts he
gives a decent enough performance nonetheless. Too bad about the drinks and
drugs problem he has today. Susan Sarandon gives another terrific
performance, this time as an alcoholic lawyer. Tommy Lee Jones' character
doesn't have much to do with the plot but he's a welcome addition to the
film, even though. 

While it is easy to find fault with the film it's easier to just sit back
and enjoy it. I chose the latter so I thought it was a good, if not
spectacular movie overall. 6.8/10.
<|_=00=_|>

Mark Sway is a real hero here, although he is not only a mere child, but a
disadvantaged child in the middle of adult power structures breathtaking in
their deviousness and casual cruelty.
The theme of youngsters forced by
circumstances into adult roles and responsibilities,
particularly in being more level-headed and mature
than their parent(s) has become as strikingly
common in contemporary literature as it was strikingly uncommon until about
a generation ago.  But there are ample
parallels to real life in pre-Romantic history.
It is really our modern assumptions of prolonged childhood
and
adolescence which are abnormal in the fuller perspective of human
experience.  Aren't we on the verge of these concepts'
retreating from the apogees to which western culture
pushed them in the 19th and early 20th centuries?

If so, this film is on the cusp of the trend.  Yet
it might never have worked but for the director's good fortune in locating
Brad Renfro for the lead role.
What a find!  His earthy, protean spunk and obliviousness
to any cute brown-nosing towards his elders, simply because they are elders,
make him entirely convincing in the part.
He is, I hope, on his way to being a great actor, but perhaps it will
continue to be this film which shows his freshness most clearly.

Not that it isn't very taut cinema in other regards.
The build up of drama in the opening scenes is superb, with acting,
cinematography, and the score all combining to provide a seamless
experience.  As one critic put it, it starts like a house afire, and the
fire never goes out.  This is a film one can see again and again, noticing
additional fine touches each time.

The Client is a good film with moments of extreme greatness especially
for a courtroom thriller such as this. But there are also scenes where
they should have been added into the editing room. The film was
excellent in the beginning, slows to a crawl in the middle, and picks
up in the end. If it stayed like the beginning, this film would have
been flawless.

After a 11-year-old kid and his brother witnessed a suicide, the kid
hires an attorney to help protect him and his family from threatening
mafia members and a stubborn Federal District attorney.

The acting is very good in this film. Susan Sarandon seemed like she
was born to play this role. She was just perfect! For a kid who never
acted before, Brad Renfro was brilliant as the snobby 11-year-old.

Overall, this is a slightly above-average crime thriller. Sarandon
steals the show as her role of the attorney. Joel Schumacher directed a
masterpiece compared to the Batman films he would take over after this
film. I rate this film 8/10.
<|_=00=_|>
First off all, you should always read the book first. I think it is a
pretty good adaption. John Grisham fans should not be disappointed by
the choice of actors for the parts in the book. Especially Tommy Lee
Jones, a personal favorite, plays his part well, and his scenes with
Sarandon are the best part of the film. They keep testing each other
and have some verbal clashes but in the end you can see Jones'
character isn't as bad as he seems and he clearly respects Sarandon's
efforts. Only negative comment for this movie is that it never seems to
reach the suspense it is aiming for and so it becomes good
entertainment for one evening but forgettable soon after.
<|_=00=_|>
I was hooked from the start when, because of the great writing, acting
and directing, I felt concerned about the characters even though I knew
they really weren't in danger because they were the crux of the movie.
And that pleasant surprise continued right to the end of the film with
its clever writing that had me alternately enthralled or chuckling
(appropriately) at plot twists. 

Another pleasant surprise was that it had a PG-13 rating. Aside from
the rough language many teens actually use, there was no unnecessary
gore, sex or violence. Ironic given the Mafia plot line. You get the
point & feeling without the unnecessary graphic element most other
directors would go for.

I suspected it would be a great movie with Tommy Lee Jones and Susan
Sarandon in it & I wasn't disappointed. The one deduction was for some
obvious plot holes.

The shattering information that the lead died as a teenager in real
life of a heroin overdose just makes it more of a tragedy that his
talent is gone. But he did himself proud with this, his debut.
