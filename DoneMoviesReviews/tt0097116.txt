Watching this wonderful film will make you believe that true happiness is
out there, somewhere.The romantic love that gives you butterflies in your
tummy. You will laugh, cry and cheer. The casting is great and Lloyd Bridges
gives a performance to remember him by. I found it overall entertaining and
left me with a nice warm feeling (and a runny nose). Life should be so
sweet.

"Cousins", a pleasing knock-off of Oscar nominated French "Cousin,
Cousine",
tells of a man who has an affair with another woman while their partners
are
doing the same; concomitant relationships, one carnal and the other
romantic.  Full of quirky Euro-Am ethnic family members, this lively and
sweet blast from the past is a light-hearted blend of sentimental,
romantic,
funny, and poignant moments well worth a first look or revisit.

I loved the 1975 French movie "Cousin, Cousine" (roughly pronounced 'koo-ZAN
koo-ZEEN', for the non-francophiles).  It was a very funny, very sexy and
"tres French" movie.

So I rolled my eyes when I heard of this American remake, especially when I
learned that Ted Danson would play the male lead.  Nothing against Mr.
Danson's abilities, but I assumed the casting of a television star --
"Cheers" was still going strong on NBC at the time -- meant that bigger
names had identified this film as a stinker and were staying
away.

I was happily surprised when this remake turned out to be as funny, warm and
romantic (if a tad less sexy) than the original.  In fact, it's nearly the
same movie, and in this case that's a good thing.  Thankfully Paramount
didn't feel the need to alter too much.

Like "Four Weddings and a Funeral" (which came after), most of the action in
this movie takes place at various ritual gatherings of family and friends. 
Danson and Isabella Rossellini play cousins by marriage who are each saddled
with attractive but less than desirable mates: hilarious performances by
Sean Young and William L. Petersen.

In fact, everyone is good in this movie.  It should have led to better movie
parts for Mr. Danson, but unfortunately it wasn't a financial success. 
Lloyd Bridges as a family patriarch is a revelation.  Again, if the film had
done better at the box office, he might have earned an academy award
nomination.

"Cousins" is a large-cast movie that leaves one feeling good without
ignoring the pain in life.  It's "wedding as microcosm" and everyone has a
part to play.  It's unusual to see a movie with so many age groups
represented, and everyone equal.  It's not a teen film, but neither is it an
anti-teen film.  It's a film about the swirl of life.  Babies are born, old
people die, couples form and break-up... and all observed from a slightly
removed point of view, so that we see ourselves and also see that we
shouldn't always take ourselves too seriously.

Don't let your preconceptions keep you away from "Cousins."  It's a
wonderful little/big movie.

Well made American rendition of the 1975 French farce, "Cousin-cousine,"
with Danson and the enchanting Rosselini playing cousins by marriage who
meet at a wedding, develop a relationship and then fall in love. Wonderful
performances from
Lloyd Bridges and Norma Alejandro help move this glorious film along that
glows with humor, warmth and the sheer joy of life.

I can't put my finger on it, but this is one of my favorite movies.  Could
be the music, could be the story, but most likely it is the wonderful
character development.  You know these people by the end of the movie.  It
is also much funnier than I expected.  This movie really snuck up on me,
which is probably why I enjoyed it so much.  I had never heard of it when I
first saw it and was therefore expecting nothing.  So, I guess this
commentary just doomed the movie to mediocrity for all those who see it for
the first time after reading my opinion.

This picture has all the elements you need for a great romantic movie. 
Mostly it will make you laugh and tug at your heart strings.

You really start to feel for Larry (Danson) and Maria (Rossellini).  Larry
and his wife Tish (Young) care for each other but aren't in love, and Maria
and her husband Tom (Petersen) seemed to be trapped together because they
have a young daughter.  

The story gets started when, at the wedding reception of Maria's mother Edie
(Aleandro), Tish and Tom sneak off and fool around together.  In the mean
time back at the reception, Larry and Maria meet and begin talking, and when
their spouses show up together, are both suspicious, but say nothing.  Then,
the next day, Maria goes to visit Larry to get his opinion of what happened
the day before.

From there, we get to go on their journey as they become friends and then,
more than friends.  And there's quite a bit that will make you happy and sad
along the way.

This is a great movie for a lazy Saturday afternoon...

I am not a great lover of "art film" and I remember finding Cousin
Cousine pleasant but very self-conscious and lacking credibility.  This
North American rewrite takes itself less seriously and is, to me at least,
much more entertaining.  The writing is good, the cinematography is good
and
the principals perform well.  Of course, we begin with the ridiculous
premise that the husband of the lovely Isabella Rosselini is a lecherous
creep and that the more sympathetically portrayed wife of Ted Danson so
insecure as to be attracted to him.  But we get over this and enjoy the
romp.  Isabella is, to me at least, beautiful as ever and the supporting
cast is terrific.  Sean Young, Lloyd Bridges and Norma Aleandro are great
but the quality extends all the way down to the short appearance by the
plump lady who played the dancing teacher "Mrs Greenblat".  This is a fun
romantic comedy worth seeing.

Schumacher has never made a better film; this one is filled with good humor
and lovely dialogue, and filmed with great love at a variety of interesting
locations. All four principal characters
are well-played, with Rossellini a standout because of her character's
lovable good nature. A real treat for lovers of comedy or romance, with a
perfect, perfect ending.
<|_=00=_|>
You wouldn't think that Ted Danson would translate well to the big
screen, but he is magical in the role of Larry Kozinski. Isabella
Rossellini is her usual beautiful, understated, elegant self in the
role of Maria. When the two are on screen together, the sparks fly.
Sean Young, Norma Aleandro, Lloyd Bridges, Keith Coogan, and William
Petersen round out an excellent ensemble. The real star of this picture
is the soundtrack. Every time the theme song is played, I cry and cry.
It is so beautiful. I could watch this movie every day and find
something new every time I watch it. This movie is sly, sophisticated,
funny, sad, and very, very real. If you haven't seen it yet, you have
missed a gem. It is definitely a must-see.

I can't imagine why this movie has only received a rating of 6 in this
database.  If you read the comments, everyone liked it.  There were so
many
neat little things going on it in I decided to look up both the director
and
screenwriter.  I want to make sure I see more of their
stuff.
