I have no wish to comment on the historical accuracy or otherwise of this
film, as it is the story that held me enthralled, not the attention to
fact.

The first time I saw this film, I nearly had to pick my jaw up from the
floor.  A hollywood movie.....that doesn't spoonfeed me the plot like some
overbearing nanny?  An original (for a big studio) plot device?  Whew, let
me just sit down for a minute.  Here's how it normally goes:  Hero (young,
handsome and likeable) must compete with rival (villanous, evil rogue) in
contest of high stakes.  Guess the outcome.  But in this underrated gem of
a
story, we find two equally heroic protagonists, all thoughts of friendship
lost as they are forced into a dangerous competition of courage and
strength.  One, fighting for the woman he loves, the other for his life.
This forces the viewer to watch in an agonized state of uncertainty.  Who
do
I want to win?  Who deserves it more?  What will happen to the loser?  This
was the first film in a long time that truly forced me to get involved with
the characters, not in a cliched good versus evil kind of way, but a good
versus good "how the hell are they going to get out of this one?" kind of
way.  Okay, so some aspects of the film do not deliver with the same power,
and some of the accents do tend to waver a little, but the beautifully
constructed central storyline held me until the end.
<|_=00=_|>

I am saddened that so few people seem to have seen
this film; It is worth watching for the lush photography alone.. It takes
some getting used to the accents of the actors, and many lines may not be
clear on first viewing.

I have read many books about Easter Island and the
mystery
surrounding its statues.. This film attempts to answer some of these
mysteries (how the statues were moved, why work stopped so abruptly on then,
what happened to all the trees on the Island,
etc.)
First read up in an encyclopedia on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) and then
watch history (or at least a good guess at it)
come to life. Film making and story telling at it's best,
along
with an athletic competition at the end unlike any you have ever seen.


<|_=00=_|>


Rapa Nui is more than just a bunch of Polynesian (and Hispanic!) actors
running around half-nekkid.
It's an allegory about the dangers of theocratic government, and a tale
of class struggle.
Rapa Nui is the Polynesian name for Easter Island, that famous dot in the
Pacific Ocean with the mysterious statues.  We get to see how these things
were carved - and why.  The Long Ear tribe has effectively subjugated the
Short Ear tribe, forcing them to carve Moai (statues) in order to placate
the gods.
Director Kevin Reynolds uses the island and the carving of statues as an
effective backdrop to illustrate the enmity between the tribes, as well as a
power struggle for eventual spremacy of the island.
The film is driven by visuals and ideas.  The writing hardly ever rises
above so-so, and it's jarring to hear Polynesian-looking people with
British, American and Latino accents.
But the film has a certain power to fascinate, and for that alone I
recommend it highly.
<|_=00=_|>

The island itself is stunningly beautiful and the film makes good use of
this, especially the race at the end which is compelling in its apparent
difficulty for the actors.
As for the accuracy of the film it is mainly based on guesswork, so the
whole racial element is for the benefit of drama. What surprises me is that
some of the other reviewers wonder how an advanced civilisation can be so
racist! Take a look at your own society and wonder!
As well as a love story there is a competitive element, and an explanation
about what happened to the island. If Easter Island interests you this film
will entertain. As for the nudity, don't be so prudish!

After watching this movie one can only wonder why hasn't anyone heard
of this what was happening in 1994 the overshadowed this movie. Was it
a lack of promotion the presumably R rating?.

I found this to be an excellent film all the characters main and
supporting are very intriguing the setting is breathtaking , and the
actors all played their roles superbly and with passion.

I did not find a problem with the English speaking actors I feel the
director wanted to get the point of the movie across without tiring the
audience out by having to read subtitles.This is a movie after all not
real life, one cant expect things to be exact.

This movie is far different then most of what Hollywood churns out the
plot is simple as the time the movie takes place the story is very
believable and understandable with some historical elements thrown in. 

As one watches this film they will come to see that's there's no simple
answer to the protagonist problems they will have to take them selves
back to that time and place.

As far as a love story goes i feel its an epic one easily as touching
if not more so then Star Wars or Titanic, Also similar to 10,000 BC.
Its shame that such a good movie seems to have gone virtually unheard
of.
<|_=00=_|>

The studios should be applauded when they take on a movie that involves
an
all new setting and topic, and encouraged to do so more often. We have
plenty of stupid eye candy car chase movies and murder mystery flicks for
those who enjoy that stuff. Rapa Nui goes somewhere else entirely. The
road
less travelled as it were.

Set on Easter Island, isolated as it is literally thousands of nautical
miles from its nearest neighbour, the movie fleshes out the most pivital
time in that islands history, as we understand it from the archeological
evidence available. The residents had every reason to believe they
represented the only life in the universe. Those of the population with
vision must have been appalled to watch their religeous zealots
engineering
the destruction of the only habitat in the world. The protagonist seems
to
be one of those who sees the folly and wants to prevent it.

** spoiler coming?**

I am not the first to note that this film weakens its message by
allowing,
even fostering unintended humour at places where it is not appropriate.
The
head engineer of statue construction falling to the ground and flailing
in a
tantrum when the chief glibly states the statue, carved and transported
with
many months of tremendous labour is dismissed and ordered broken up as
being
"too small", and that chief, when he complains to his obviously self
serving
and manipulative with doctor/adviser,"I've been coughing up and vomiting
blood lately. Do you think that means anything?" "No, replies the
adviser,
it's nothing". It seems as though the screenwriter thinks the viewer must
have some levity to break up the serious subject matter. The humour takes
away much more than it adds to the story however and hearing a couple of
audience members guffawing from time to time when we should be
sympathising
with the frustration of the main character has the effect of pulling the
rug
out from under the mood. Even the 'last cutting' scene is overblown and
rendered campy when this scene, of which perhaps the most empathy might
have
been drawn of any in the entire film, is played out almost as satire.

**End of spoiler**

So much for the 'It could have been better' part, the movie does
deserve
kudos for tackling new ground. The cinematography is beautiful, the love
story plausable and the main characters earn our support. Bravo for being
daring enough to make this flick. I just wish it had been
distributed.

<|_=00=_|>
A victim of razzing when new and ever since. However, breathtakingly
filmed, especially the brutal tribal competition. One of 4 films (and
the most unclad) that Jason Scott Lee made in a short time, and even
more athletic than his Bruce Lee biopic, 'Dragon', although
dramatically J.S. Lee's most memorable performance was as the Inuit
halfbreed Avik in 'Map of the Human Heart.' 

Sandrine Holt as his beloved is luminous, while Esai Morales is the
villain-- -again. A plot-nudging iceberg is obviously a construct but
only a brief story device before it floats away. Sadly, the stateside
DVD has been withdrawn, leaving only South Korean copies (in English,
however) with some manufacturing glitches fore and aft for collectors
unwilling to settle for used merchandise..

... and I am very glad I did.

I had not seen the movie prior to going there 6 months ago, for two
reasons: people told me it was boring, and when I started watching it,
I was bothered by the orangey hue of the movie.

I'm glad that this time I persisted. By no means a classic, it
certainly is entertaining, and the actions scenes are genuinely GOOD. 

I went to Rapa Nui because I was mesmerized with the idea of an
ultra-isolated island where an ecological tragedy happened because of
huge stone heads. In fact, I read extensively about the island before
visiting it. The reading I recommend the most is Jared Diamond's book
"Collapse", which draws from reputable scientific sources and Mr.
Diamond's encyclopedic knowledge of geography and biology.

I was hoping to find an island of archaeological interest. What I found
was an open-air museum that exceeded all my expectations about
archeology, and also a very pleasant and delightful place to visit.

There is no crime. There is no pollution. The only (tiny) beach has
white sand and blue water in a perfect temperature. The natives are
incredibly nice and even the tourists were interesting (because,
really, who goes there?). Now I have a toddler-sized moai in my living
room and many wonderful pictures with stones, moai, sunsets, stones,
blue sea, volcanoes, moai, and lots of more stones.

And the trees? Around the only town, Hanga Roa, there are many of them!
Traumatized with the haunting tale of environment destruction, people
are starting to plant crops, and the hotels have beautiful gardens, and
the whole town is shady and breezy because of all the trees. It's not
all dryness and destruction.

I also believe this movie is underrated. Don't go by the negative
interviews! The orangey colors of the movie, though lamentable, don't
detract from the overall experience, but if you can find a better copy,
by all means do so.

To judge from the derision heaped on this film, one could be forgiven
for thinking it must be totally unwatchable, however, that definitely
is not the case. The film was shot on location and despite liberties
taken with history, it is an absorbing look at a mysterious culture
that has virtually disappeared.

1400 years ago, Polynesian seafarers settled on the most remote island
on earth, Easter Island or Rapa Nui as they called it. Although most of
what is known about their history is speculation based on
archaeological evidence, it seems the island went through an intense
period of statue (moai) building, followed by an equally intense period
of tearing them down. In the course of which, Rapa Nui was denuded of
trees and its society decimated by warfare and famine. To regulate
their dwindling resources, the islanders conducted an annual ocean race
with the winner's tribe ruling the island for a year under their
leader, the Birdman.

Kevin Reynolds' movie is about these events. In fact, every event in
the island's history is in the film. What took over 1000 years to
unfold takes place in what seems like a single season. Time compression
is one of the major criticisms of the film.

The writers constructed a Romeo and Juliet love story around the
characters played by Jason Scott Lee, Sandrine Holt, and Esai Morales.
This aspect of the story is quite effective due to their convincing
performances. Less convincing are passages of silly dialogue between
Eru Potaka-Dewes, and George Henare playing the reigning Birdman and
the High Priest respectively. However, these are exceptions; the rest
of the script effectively moves the story along and explains why things
are happening to this doomed culture.

The making and moving of the moai are highlights of the film as is the
birdman competition; an event so gruelling that by comparison, a modern
triathlon seems about as difficult as an egg-and-spoon race. The film
recreates the event at the actual location: the cliffs at Orongo. Today
it is forbidden to scale these cliffs but it seems the film was shot
before the restriction existed.

The score by Stewart Copeland, the former drummer of the band Police,
features a blend of choral, orchestral and new age elements. A
traditional score may have worked but this one is inspired, delivering
a sense that time is running out for Rapa Nui.

Much bare skin is exposed in the movie and nearly all the women appear
topless. Gratuitousness is another charge levelled at the film, however
the alternative would have been Dorothy Lamour sarongs. Historical
evidence suggests the costume designers got it right, which probably
pleased the marketing people who no doubt had an eye on the box office.

Rapa Nui offers a very different cinema experience. It is not without
the odd gaffe, but it is also totally unique and utterly compelling as
well.
<|_=00=_|>
The inhabitants of Rapa Nui forged one of the great cultures of
antiquity. They settled a small, utterly remote island in the South
Pacific and developed a unique, centuries-old way of life known
worldwide for creating monumental stone statues to evoke and venerate
their ancestors. There is nothing like their astonishing achievement in
the annals of civilization.

Writer/director Kevin Reynolds distorts and insults the noble heritage
of this island and its proud people with this tawdry epic. RAPA NUI
seizes on lurid mythsecocide, internecine warfare, starvation,
cannibalism, and genocide--to depict past life on the isolated isle as
a dismal, dog-eat-dog existence of bottomless despair and cruelty. 

Not so. To wit: 

-There is no archaeological evidence of cannibalism on Easter Island.

-The Long Ears and the Short Ears, supposedly separate races or clans,
probably never existed, and thus never engaged in genocidal warfare. On
the contrary, Rapanui society must have been highly cooperative to
carve, transport, and erect the colossal statues, as well as to
cultivate crops given the island's harsh winds and challenging growing
conditions.

-The infamous cutting down of the 16 million trees that originally
covered the island was to clear space for agriculture and grazing. Once
cut, wood was put to many uses. Rolling the gigantic statues on logs
was not the sole or main purpose of clear-cutting, which took place
over centuries.

-The religious/political cult of the birdman replaced the veneration of
ancestors when the prodigious feat of making statues was no longer
sustainable. Statue-carving and the birdman race were not
contemporaneous.

-Likewise, the statues were not being toppled as they were
simultaneously being manufactured. Probably 200 years passed between
the end of statue production and deposing statues in clan rivalries.

Okay, viewers may not care about historical accuracy but just want some
rousing entertainment. Alas, with RAPA NUI, they are still out of luck.

It's supposedly a love story, but the heroine is out of sight, shut up
in a cave for most of the movie. She looks hideously disheveled when
she finally emerges. Yum.

The Short Ears' seemingly voluntary enslavement makes no sense. Why do
they put up with brutality and suffering to make statues for the
priestly class? How accommodating they are! The Long Ears' power rests
on the religious imperative to appease the ancestral spirits. But such
moral suasion hardly offers a compelling motive for the Short Ears'
elective servitude.

Rapa Nui's troubles are often regarded as a microcosm for the dangers
of reckless exploitation of the environment. But the film's depiction
of class struggle within an enclosed society with finite resources so
lacks subtlety that it is hard to take seriously as a cautionary tale
for today's world.

This picture contains one of the most preposterous deus ex machinas in
film history. Everyone on the island wants to escape, to sail over the
horizon to find a better, happier land. Ah, but there is no wood left
to build boats. The answer for the delusional high priest and his
gullible followers? Board an iceberg that suddenly appears.

An iceberg.

Really.

At latitude 27 degrees south--nearly tropical watersthey might just as
well have found mermaids to carry them away.

As for the cast, the acting is on the see-and-say level. Everyone runs
around in skimpy costumes, which at least makes for eye candy. Only
Gordon Hatfield, as the heroine's father, creates a character with some
depth who appears to possess emotions beyond rage, fear, and longing.
His performance is the best part of the film, along with the birdman
race, which seems quite authentic (except historically, the race was
over when the first sooty tern egg was found on the offshore islet. The
finder did have to bring it back up the cliff intact, but doing so was
not part of the race).

Despite being filmed entirely on location, there's a sense of
artificiality about the statues. The bogus meter starts running early
withthe opening credits as the camera tracks up the cliffs of the Ranu
Kau volcano to three statues (nonexistent in real life) standing high
on the narrow crater rim. Ridiculous. That's the last place the
islanders would ever have dragged them. Statues stood on low ground,
facing inland on wide platforms. These Hollywood replicas teeter on
lofty heights gazing out to sea. Makes for a dramatic shot but absurd
archaeology.

Statues the Short Ears carve in the film look fake, big props lacking
the contours and color of the originals. When the biggest one is
vengefully toppled, the film cuts away the instant before it crashes.
Styrofoam just doesn't shatter like rock when it hits the ground.

Production of this $20 million flop in 1994 has had lasting effects for
today's inhabitants of Rapa Nui. The sudden influx of film money into a
hardscrabble sheep ranching existence brought about a startling
transformation in island life, shifting the entire basis of the economy
to tourism with remarkable swiftness.

In a rather eerie redux of past ecological disasters, the island's
resources now strain to accommodate 90,000 visitors per year.
Discotheques rock until dawn and internet cafés dot the streets of
Hanga Roa, the only town, which 30 years ago was a dirt road lined with
shacks where there wasn't even a telephone. Now luxury hotels charge
$1,000 per night. The standard of living in what was formerly a very
sleepy place has improved exponentially.

RAPA NUI, this violent, almost sadistic movie that debases the island
has, ironically, presumably made it a more livable locale. Producer
Kevin Costner and Warner Brothers join smallpox-carrying European
explorers, Peruvian slave traders, Chilean colonialists, rapacious
sheep ranchers, missionaries, and archaeologists to create the latest
turning point in this fascinating island's tumultuous history.
