Having seen "The Pledge" without knowing much about it, I got something
other than what I bargained for. But that's not necessarily a bad
thing.

If you're looking for a good whodunit, avoid this movie. If you're looking
for a fast-paced thriller, avoid this movie. But if you're into seeing an
intense character study bolstered by impressive acting and clever directing
(kudos, Sean Penn), you've come to the right place.

I read one IMDB review calling this film Nicholson's worst ever. This is not
true -- that reviewer obviously never saw "Man Trouble" -- but I can see why
some folks really don't like this movie. It doesn't deliver what you'd
expect, and what it does deliver is neither conventional nor uplifting. In
fact, it's pretty depressing. But if you ponder the story afterward, you
realize there's a certain dark justice at work here. Like, blacklight
dark.

So then, "The Pledge" is not a light and frothy piece, but if you're the
type who thinks watching some poor b**tard's descent into madness is
entertainment, have at it.

Sean Penn proves himself a first-rate director who gets moving, deep
performances out of all his actors.  And what a supporting cast - in
addition to Nicholson (at his most subtle, something he doesn't always do),
there's Harry Dean Stanton, Benecio Del Toro, Tom Noonan, Vanessa Redgrave,
Robin Wright Penn, the list goes on and on with the best charactor actors
around.  Del Toro does something completely different once again.  The story
is very moving and almost at the level of a Greek tragedy.  Beautifully shot
and edited with good use of score.  The best drama I've seen in quite a
while.
<|_=00=_|>

Faithful to the book in most regards, the film is excellent, and
Nicholson's
performance is beyond reproach.  While the denouement may have had issues
(not with the point or the meaning, but rather the delivery), the film is
still outstanding.

Nicholson's relationship with the girl (he is beautiful as an aged
father)
and his inexorable obsession with the murderer are perfect in the film.
Sadly, Penn's pacing is inconsistent, as is the sense of "detective" that
Duerenmatt was careful to give his novel: the film's heartbeat ranges
from
driving to rambling, and most thematically appropriate may have been a
measured beat which is lacking here.

Nonetheless, the film is gripping, and captures the point, spirit and
feel
of the novel perfectly.  It may not pull off the trick of being both
faithful and profitable, but the film is true, and the acting
impeccable.

Saw this film on cable last night (only the last hr. or so) & it was
extraordinary. Nicholson gives both a moving & harrowing performance as
an old, hard-drinking, washed up police detective. Though his character
is in the dregs, he still manages to compel our empathy. Not since
"Ironweed" has he attempted a character so thoroughly seedy.

His relationship w. Robin WRight & Wright's daughter is affecting; and
the plot developments around the child murderer stalking the daughter
are riveting.

The film concludes in a downbeat way that only a director like Sean
Penn would have been brave enough to attempt in this era of happy
Hollywood endings. Though we as audience know that Nicholson was right
in his suspicions of the murderer, none of the characters (including
Nicholson's) realize this. At the end, everyone gives up on Nicholson,
believes he is nuts; & he in turn reverts to a life of booze &
unintelligible muttering. It is heartbreaking to watch. As you watch
Wright flay Nicholson for letting her daughter be a lure for the
murderer; and we watch Nicholson react w. sullen silence to the
onslaught, we are twisted into paroxysms of sadness for him. You
realize the moral complexity of the situation: in order to keep faith
w. other parents who've lost children to this murderer, Nicholson has
endangered the daughter of a woman he has come to love. And she in turn
comes to hate him when she learns what he has done. This is a profound
moral dilemma.

Penn has created a masterful film, proving yet again that he is one of
our better directors. "The Pledge" is one of which he can rightly feel
proud.

I had rather low expectations for The Pledge - even though I've admired
Penn as an actor (Dead Man Walking, Racing With The Moon, etc.) I
really didn't care much for his writing/directing attempts (Indian
Runner and The Crossing Guard) so I finally got around to watching this
on cable and I was not prepared for how intriguing, intelligent and
emotionally powerful the movie was. Yes, obviously, from other people's
comments, this isn't every one's cup of tea. Fine. You want quickie
thriller, wall to wall action - go watch Con Air or something. Popcorn
movies are fine. People need to turn off their brains and escape every
now and then (Unfortunately for big budget movies - its more NOW and
very rarely THEN)> So that is why I really enjoyed the slow pace and
the ambiguity of the plot - it left things out there for you to find,
to discover, to ponder. Nicholson - who is so capable of just phoning
it in lately or just doing a gig for a paycheck (Anger Management -
YIKES!!!) - but here he really delivers a strong, aching performance.
He is surrounded by excellent actors (especially Del Toro, Eckhart and
a very impressive tiny scene from Mickey Rourke). I know there are huge
fans of the German book and the movie - I will seek them out. But I
have watched this film twice and it is even more powerful the second
time. One CAN be driven mad by NEVER knowing something so ghastly,
something so important.
<|_=00=_|>

I have been an admirer of Sean Penn's previous directorial efforts ('The
Indian Runner' and 'The Crossing Guard'), but he has really surpassed
himself with this one. Re-teamed with Jack Nicholson he has helped that
legendary actor create his best on screen performance since his 1970s peak
('Five Easy Pieces', 'Last Detail', 'Cuckoo's Nest', 'Marvin Gardens' et
al). Nicholson has always been sensational but over the last ten years or so
has sleepwalked his way through way too many movies, culminating in his
irritating and mannered performance in the cliched and sentimental claptrap
'As Good As It Gets'. 'The Pledge' has obviously recharged his creative
batteries. He is simply stunning in this film.

Nicholson is supported by a superlative array of actors, ranging from Aaron
Eckhart ('The Company Of Men') and Sam Shepard ('The Right Stuff') to
British vets Helen Mirren and Vanessa Redgrave, to Nicholson's old cronies
Lois Smith ('Five Easy Pieces') and Harry Dean Stanton ('The Rebel
Rousers'). While the cast is packed with familiar faces, none are
gratuitous, all are first rate, and contribute to the overall excellence of
the movie. Special mention must be made to the memorable cameos of Benicio
Del Toro, and an as especially compelling performance by Mickey Rourke. Long
underrated and often ridiculed, Rourke once again shows just how compelling
he is as an actor.

'The Pledge' sticks out like a sore thumb in today's climate of wall to wall
action movies, dumb comedies, and contrived "blockbusters". This is a real
movie, with outstanding acting and a haunting story. Sadly fewer and fewer
movies of this calibre are hitting the big screen, so treasure
it!

THE PLEDGE / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four) 

By Blake French:

	Don't go to "The Pledge" expecting it to be a suspense thriller with a lot
of fast-paced action and the tension peak high. By the misleading trailer
and TV ads, I was personally expecting the above. "The Pledge," directed by
the underrated actor and producer Sean Penn, is more of an unraveling drama
than a genuine nail-biter. The film is a lot more than a conventional, run
of the mill chiller. It vividly describes the process in which a person goes
through before he reaches the state of insanity. The movie is most outwardly
about obsession and commitment, more subtly about loneliness and depravity.
This is one the most unusually absorbing movies of the new
year.

Sean Penn is often overlooked as a Hollywood figure. He is an actor more
often then he is a director (his most memorable directing feature was "The
Crossing Guard"), but his work quite variegated. In 1998, Penn Portrayed a
Sergeant in Terrence Malick's acclaimed war drama "The Thin Red Line," and a
drug addicted Hollywood casting agent in "Hurlyburly." In 1997, he portrayed
Michael Douglas' estranged brother in David Fincher's mystery thriller "The
Game," and a down-on-his-luck drifter in Oliver Stone's gritty film noir
"U-Turn." He delivered his most powerful performance in 1995 as a man on
death row in "Dead Man Walking." Now, with "The Pledge" he is harrowing and
intense, even though the script is often slow moving and monotonous. The
stark edge and superior direction give the movie an authentic feel and
emotional vigor. Sean Penn once again proves himself to be an excellent
filmmaker especially behind the screen. 

	The enormously talented, Academy Award winner Jack Nicholson stars as the
retiring Reno homicide detective Jerry Black. Jerry is a superb
investigator, and when he examines his final case, the sexual assault and
murder of an eight-year-old girl, he promises the victim's mother he will
find the individual in charge of the atrocity. Police quickly bring in a
mentally handicapped American Indian (Benicio Del Toro), who was found
fleeing the crime scene and previously served time for rape and various
other crimes. It appears that the officers found the man responsible, and
when he confesses to the crime and kills himself, the other officers,
including Jerry's friend, Stan (Aaron Eckhart), and their boss (Sam
Shepard), consider this an open-shut case. Jerry has a gut-feeling this
person is not who they are looking for, however. 

	The remainder of the movie is not about a police investigation, but more
about Jerry Black's reaction to the events that have taken place. His
obsession with catching the killer eventually leads to him going crazy,
after he betrays his new friends, a single mother (Robin Wright Penn), and
her young daughter. I personally desired more material involving the
investigation instead of the development of the relationship between him and
Robin Wright Penn's character, but that is not what the movie intended for
us to watch. Regardless, the story arguably begins at its strongest point,
and gradually losses much momentum as the mystery is not fully explored, and
certain elements feel setup but are not paid off.

	Some of the production's technical areas are also very astonishing, like
the original music by Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer, and the cinematography
by Chris Menges. Such ambient factors make for a sleepy and tranquil mood
similar to the one in "Fargo." This film's soundtrack contains enthralling,
refreshing, and captivating instrumental tones. Jack Nicholson is
tormenting, riveting. He is the central of the movie, and it doesn't
pretends otherwise. His performance provides energy for the
story.	

"The Pledge" is the type of movie that leaves us pondering about the
opportunities passed by and the chances missed by the characters, the ironic
coincidences, and the perplexing twists. The ending leaves us with more
questions than answers, but that factor contributes greatly to the emotional
impact the film has. "The Pledge" could have been more than it is, but
considering the temptations the screenwriters overcame, it is more than what
most of us would expect. 


<|_=00=_|>
Unsatisfying endings usually make for box-office bombs and I suspect
this one bombed, too. I don't particularly care for them, myself. I'd
rather feel good at the end of the film, but I really liked this movie
in a strange kind of way. It's weird but it's original and it stayed
with me for several days afterward. On the second viewing, knowing what
to expect, it didn't haunt me but it was worth that second look....and
probably a third one in a few years, too. I didn't care for some of the
anti-Christian tones in here, however. That is my only complaint of the
movie. A key character - a minister - is made to look evil (typical
film-world bias).

The rest of the film has a lot to offer: a great performance by Jack
Nicholson; a very nice music score; good cinematography; interesting
characters and a different, almost-shocking twist at the end.

The best part of the film is Nicholson. As usual, Jack is very
interesting, playing a low-key role here. The story might be too slow
for a lot of folks but it kept my interest all the way. On the second
viewing, I appreciated the music even more - a great soundtrack!

If you are looking for a crime film that is different, check this out,
but don't blame me if you don't like the ending.
<|_=00=_|>

The ending of this movie stinks.  It is the equivalent of telling a child a
very suspenseful tale of a prince and a dragon.  You build up skillfully to
a climactic battle, and as the prince is raising his sword, you say, "But
the dragon suddenly had a brain aneurysm and died, leaving the prince
looking like a fool who lived unhappily ever after.  Hey... sh*t happens,
you know?"

Before the sneers and mutterings of "philistine" begin, let me say that I
know what the screenwriters and the director were going for -- Greek
tragedy: a good man, a Hero is brought to ruin by a fatal flaw in his
character.  The problem is that here, as in all storytelling, a tragic
ending must also be a satisfying one for the audience.  No matter how sad
the hero's fall/demise, no matter what plot twists occur, one has to be able
to say, "Well, that's tragic, but it had to happen.  It was inevitable." 
It's a storytelling tightrope, from which the screenwriters and director
fell from great heights, crashed and burned.

In trying to throw a curve, they threw a spitball; they cheated.  A deus ex
machina ("Machine of the Gods") is a phony dramatic contrivance where the
Gods step in at the end of a story and make everything right again.  The
hero is off the hook.  What happened to the serial killer here was worse
than a deus ex machina.  He is killed by coincidence.  That's just
cheating.

I would like to suggest what would have been a truly tragic ending.  Make
Jerry Black a lonelier man.  One whose two failed marriages have left him
without hope of having a family.  Then he meets Lori and Chrissy.  His
unexpected love for them grows to *almost* the size of his obsession with
catching the killer.  Give him a true choice between love & obsession and
let him pick the wrong one.  Then let him catch the goddamned killer.  And
after he does, this Hero, having fulfilled his task, turns for love and
adoration to Lori, who lets him have the same speech she does now and whisks
herself and her daughter out of his life.  Black then fully realizes what
his heroic choice has cost him, and ends up lonely, embittered and perhaps
mad.

That would have been a satisfying ending, because the way things play now,
here's what the audience is thinking, "He deserves to catch the killer.  He
does not deserve to have this family after endangering Chrissy so
horribly."

The ending of "The Pledge" is badly, terribly wrong, as it trashes what up
until then was one of the finest suspense films I've ever seen and one of
Jack Nicholson's greatest performances.  

<|_=00=_|>
The Pledge is one of the few films directed by the now respected (if
not by the makers of Team America) actor Sean Penn, and it manages to
simultaneously remind us why he should direct more, and that Jack
Nicholson can act.

Let's face it, it's been a while  our Jack acting, that is. Most of
the time he just tilts his head, gives us a manic stare and says
"Here's Johnny" in that patented (exclusive rights to Nicholson and his
younger avatar, Slater) drawl.

Ostensibly, The Pledge is a detective story, with Nicholson playing a
retiring police officer (Jerry Black) trying to track down the killer
of a young girl. Quickly, a Native American is brought in and induced
to confess, although we're never sure whether the confession related to
an earlier crime. He then shoots himself. Job done, according to most
of the police officers, but not Jerry. He doubts the confession, and
has pledged a solemn oath to the girl's mother to find her killer.

The Pledge is not really a detective story, though, and there will be
no prizes for guessing the killer's identity. The staggeringly obvious
choice of Tom Noonan (of Manhunter fame) is proof enough of that.
Admittedly, Hollywood is capable of just such crassness of casting
where suspense is required, but not, I suspect, Penn.

But suspense is at best a distant second in this film; it is more a
study of pursuit and how a goal can blind us to the present, and to our
actions. Nicholson's performance is truly breathtaking, and one wonders
how it could have made barely a ripple when the film came out. Gone is
the trademark uber-performance. In its place we are given subtlety, a
man playing his age with dignity, and an uncompromising take on
obsession, loneliness and folly. If there is a problem in the film it
is in his relationship with the much younger Wright Penn. It's
implausible, but somehow the gravity defying Nicholson manages even to
make that convincing.

The film is watchable for Nicholson's performance alone and it could
easily have been a vehicle project. Credit to Penn, though, that he was
able to assemble such a distinguished cast for. Robin Wright Penn
(okay, maybe she wasn't so difficult), Helen Mirren, Vanessa Redgrave
and Mickey Rourke all give fine vignettes. But perhaps the most amazing
performance was Benicio Del Toro as Toby Wadenah, the accused Native
American. I knew he was in the film (one of my reasons for watching it)
but I had to double take when I saw him. His performance was
breathtaking and worth watching the entire movie, just for the 5
minutes he was in it.

Sean Penn's directorial style is similar to Clint Eastwood's. He leaves
a lot of space in The Pledge and the film proceeds at a measured pace
coming in at just over two hours, which allows the actors plenty of
room to work. His characters are mainly working class or lower middle
class. The camera-work is starkly beautiful rather than pretty, and
focuses on a bleak America that gets little airtime from the soft focus
brigade in California.

Penn is also, like Eastwood, brave enough to tie up the ends loosely at
best. The ending may be downbeat, but it is uplifting to see that
American cinema is still capable of making films like this. 8/10
