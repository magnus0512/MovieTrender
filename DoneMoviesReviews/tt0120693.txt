After reading several negative reviews analyzing this and other stoner
movies as being stupid, mindless and lacking in plot. HELLO!!! This is
a stoner movie about stoners getting stoned. Who cares about plot or
social messages or that other deep crap. You want depth go see a
Bergman or a Fellini film, lighten up and smoke a joint. I'm glad to
see stoner comedies back in fashion after suffering through
pretentious, preachy, boring 80s anti-drug dramas that are never truly
grounded in reality and where the characters always either predictably
OD or just simplistically kick their addiction. So rent this movie (or
watch it currently on cable), fire up one and enjoy

Half baked is hilarious movie to me. Its a pothead manifestation film
that doesn't take it self seriously and is pretty hilarious throughout.
Dave Chapelle is very funny in the lead and to me is a better lead
comedy actor than the likes of Martin Lawrence and even Chris Rock.
Guillermo Diaz is also very good as Scarface. Rachel True provides good
eye candy and decent performance as the female lead. This is not an
Oscar film, but hilarious to watch with buddies and after watching it 3
times it doesn't get old. Its a funny screenplay, decent comedic
direction and good performances, worth a look for any fan of comedy,
pot or cinema.. 9/10

Hilarious...or is it?...flick concerning an apartment full of pot-smokers
who get themselves in trouble with the law and end up going on a series of
the most funny adventures ever put to celluloid.  This is a gas for the "in"
crowd.  Others probably won't get all the jokes, but it is still damn
entertaining.  I know people who worship this movie...of course, they've
more than "smoked themselves retarded."
If you're "feelin it," then you'll laugh your @ss off, I
guarantee.

Half Baked is funny for all the wrong reasons.  We laugh at the antics of
pot smoking dumb asses because they are doing all the wrong things.  But, it
is hilarious nevertheless.  Especially with the funny acting of Jim Breuer,
Dave Chappelle and Harland Williams.  Even the cameos are humorous-
including Jon Stewart, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Willie Nelson, and Tommy Chong
(Chong is perfect as a small role in the movie).  The plot seems kind of
basic, but its spiced up for laughs and for people who know what being a
dope head is like.  Hilarious all around.  A+

I had never heard of this movie 'Half Baked' until I was channel
surfing cable this afternoon and came across it. While I had heard the
name Dave Chapelle because of the television show recently airing, I
was not familiar with two of the other three main characters. The guy
playing the character in jail I have seen before. In other words, I am
not up on who these people are/were. I am of the Chech and Chong 'Up in
Smoke' generation of drug themed flicks. Saw them all back in the day.
However, I found this movie much funnier than those ever were. Much
funnier. The Scarface character was hilarious, but I found the Brian
and Thurgood parts funnier and quite believable in an over-abundant
way. I have read here many stating the cameo parts were the film's
highlight. Not in my opinion. The main characters owned this one. As an
aside from a 40 something, it is nice to see that this country(USA)has
come along the road far enough whereby having a couple white guys, a
black dude and a Cuban sharing a habitat together doesn't come across
as contrived. The stoner parts all looked familiar to me. Funny movie.

My friend, (a known pothead), lent me this film and said it was funny, i
was
sceptical, a. becasue he is always stoned and once had a laughing fit at a
commercial, b. because he thinks WWF wrestling is the best thing on t.v,
but
i watched it anyway, i'm glad i did, it was hilarious, i'd highly
recommend
this film to anyone, unless they are specifically looking for a good plot
or
if they are dead against drugs, i've read some of the comments on here and
they haven't been that good, maybe you have to know someone like the
people
in this movie to get it. 8/10

This movie is hilarious.  Extremely stupid, but still hilarious. And even as
unbelievable as it is, there are people actually like this, heck I know
several of them.  The thing that makes it so funny is the fact that a bunch
of funny parts in the film actually happen.  So if you want to see funny
realism mixed with over the top fantasy, this is your film.

Very funny movie. Of the recent 'stoner' flicks, this is probably one
of the best. (Probably second in my book to Dude Where's My car?)
Ejoyable, entertaining, and weird characters. Dave Chappell is
hilarious as always. There are a ton of cameos by great and well known
comedians throughout the piece, all paying their homage to the great
herb.

I myself am not a pot smoker but laughed my rear off anyways, even if I
didn't get all of the 'inside' stuff that others may refer too.
Chappell is great playing several outlandish characters in the movie.
The situations they get themselves into are great and even better how
they get out of them.

There is ample potty humor as well as pot humor to boot. Well worth the
rental fee and your time.

The trailer for this movie looked really dumb, so I didn't see it in
theaters. Then I heard about Bob Saget's cameo (and what he says), and just
wanting to hear Saget say that made me rent the movie. Surprisingly, it's
not a bad movie. Oh, it's dumb. It's sloppy. It's *obsessed* with marijuana.
But I laughed several times in the movie, and the characters are very
likable. Best watched with a group of friends who don't mind drug
humor.

Only a true pothead could have thought up the script for HALF BAKED.  Tamra
Davis is an underrated director, with other cool movies like BEST MEN and
his other retarded comedy masterpiece, BILLY MADISON. Dave Chapelle, Jim
Breuer, Guillermo Diaz, and Harland Williams all give incredible, insane
performances. The spoofs on other films like JERRY MCGUIRE, DEAD PRESIDENTS,
SUPERMAN, as well as the old "Batman" show, are perfectly weaved in. There
are numerous cameos by tons of varied people: Snoop Dogg, Jon Stewart,
Janeane Garafalo, Willie Nelson, Stephen Baldwin, Clarence Williams 3, Tommy
Chong, Bob Saget, and others, they're all funny in their own ways. The Guy
on the Couch was the most interesting character, for mysterious reasons.
