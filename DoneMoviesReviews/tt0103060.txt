Good times once again as we return with our turtles in a half shell,
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze is the popular
sequel to the very popular and successful movie Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles. We had some minor changes to this film, while the first movie
was a success, parents complained of it's dark nature and mild cursing.
So this film was a little brighter and family friendly, while it drug
the film down a little for some odd reason I still loved this movie.
Not only me but some of my other friends loved it as well, I don't know
if it's because we grew up with this film or whatever, but we still
have so much fun watching it despite it's cheesy themes and the fact
that Vanilla Ice makes a cameo with the ever infamous Ninja Rap that he
knew the lyrics and dance too before he even knew the song existed.

The Turtles have been forced to live with their friend the news
reporter April O'Neil because the Foot Clan know the whereabouts of
their lair in the sewers. While the Turtles are looking for a new home,
they encounter a pizza delivery boy named Keno, who is trying to fight
off a band of robbers by means of his skill as a martial artist, where
the Turtles intervene on his behalf. The Foot Clan, no longer as large
as it was in the first film, have retreated to a large junkyard, where
Master Tatsu, Shredder's second in command, attempts to take control of
the gang, but is challenged by Shredder himself. Shredder was thought
to be dead. He now appears physically deformed and obsessed with
obtaining revenge, to achieve which he sends a Foot member to pose as
an intern at the news network and trail April. April is shown making a
report on the efforts of an industrial organization known as TGRI to
neutralize pollutants that have resulted from their experiments.
Splinter, seeing the report on television, shows the Turtles and April
the canister of "ooze" that had caused himself and the Turtles to
mutate into their present forms, revealing that it was made by the
TGRI. The Turtles infiltrate the TGRI offices to seize a sample of the
ooze, only to encounter Tatsu and the Foot. Despite the Turtles'
efforts to stop them, Tatsu and the Foot escape, taking the last
canister of ooze and Professor Jordan Perry with them. Shredder later
instructs Perry to use the ooze to transform a snapping turtle and a
wolf into monsters, creating the characters Tokka and Rahzar.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze is silly and
over the top, but it's still a really fun movie and has all the action
and good times the first one had. I absolutely loved the scene where
the turtles try to trick Tokka and Rahzar with the donuts, inside the
donuts are the cure to make them small again, but of course they don't
fall for it after a while and the turtles have the butts handed back to
them, big time. I also love the little flaw where the last film
Shredder is crushed in a garbage truck, he comes back to life, but he
becomes super Shredder where nothing should kill him at all, except for
a bridge that falls on him and the turtles, but the turtles manage to
survive, lol. It's all good though, this is just a fun movie and I'll
always watch it, besides you have to keep that Ninja Rap alive.

7/10
<|_=00=_|>
The sequel to the smash hit 1990 TMNT, starts off greatly with an
introduction to a new character (Keno) and has a great pizza scene
showing how the city loves New York pizza as well as metaphorically
showing the viewers watching that this indeed is a turtles movie...The
opening music is great and is perfect for the city scene.

The plot is not as well thought out as the original but still does the
turtles a good name for them...I still feel they rushed it a little
seeing that the movie was in production right after the 1st movie went
into theaters...I seem to feel the super shredder was the turning point
in the franchise, meaning that it went from a sort of Tim Burtan feel
with TMNT 1, and ended up with a corny kid focused feeling with the
introduction of the super shredder..and the ninja rap didn't help
either..all though I thought it was cool....I just wished secret of the
ooze was more of a dark TMNT movie....which the 1st movie held on to
strong.

The addition of Professor Jorden Perry and the whole TGRI company was a
great idea to explain the chemical spill and the mutation the turtles
went through. His mature nature and serious tone helped the movie
maintain a sense of maturity as well as stability in the plot.

The acting was great in this one as well and the comedy was just as
good as in the first movie. Although Corey Feldman did not voice
Donetello in this one, the replaced voice actor was great...I even
might say that the actor that voiced Don in TMNT 2 is just as good as
Cory Feldman's voice acting in the 1st and 3rd movie.

IN conclusion, TMNT: Secret of the Ooze is a great sequel that is both
funny as well as serious and is a great movie for any age. The only
thing that bothered me was that is was slightly too focused on the
youth audience and didn't stay 100% with the original's dark
atmosphere.

The fearsome foursome turtles go after the glowing cannister that
mutated them as babies. While the turtles are trying to find the
meaning of their lives and the ooze is slipped into the hands of the
evil Shredder (Francois Chau). Shredder asks the help of an unwillingly
scientist (David Warner) to make his mutant allies, Rahzar and Tokka.
The Turles seeks help with the young pizza deliver boy-Keno (Ernie
Reyes, Jr.). The Heroes dive into action and of course, Pizza! 

Directed by Michael Pressman (Doctor Detroit, Some Kind of Hero, To
Gillian on Her 37th Birthday) made an entertaining sequel. This is a
bigger budgeted film than the first movie. As usual, the highlight is
the animatronic characters by Jim Henson's creature shop. The plot of
the sequel is extremely silly but never boring. Paige Turco replaced
Judith Hoag from the original and Turco is appealing in the film. Too
Bad, Elias Koteas didn't return for the sequel and Corey Feldman didn't
return to voice Donatello also. The film was a hit like the original.
The only flaw in the sequel is the ending, which it is a mess.
Rapper:Vanilla Ice appears in a embarrassing cameo. This sequel is
amusing for the kids and fun for the fans of the comic book series.

The turtles have thwarted the evil Shredder and his army of ninja thieves
and are now searching for a new home.However,it soon emerges The Shredder is
set to return to wreak more havoc,and has the ways and the means of
unleashing a terrible new threat to the crime fighting awesome foursome.As
they set out to stop him,the turtles come to learn more about where they
came from and the secrets of their origin...

At the time of the original film's release,the TV series and the toys were
at the height of their popularity and so a feature film was
inevitable.However,it was a relatively low budget Golden Harvest production
that went on to become the most successful independent film of all time.GH
still played quite a huge part in the proceedings with this second
instalment,however the first film had been a major success,a sequel was as
inevitable as the original adaptation that preceded it and so now,a
worldwide big major studio like Twentieth Century Fox wanted to have a cut
in the stakes and so stepped in to cash in on the franchise.And hey,nobody
makes family blockbusters like Twentieth Century Fox,right?Well,maybe
Universal.

Anyone who would regard Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 as pointless is,in
essence,unable to see past their own nose.The law of physics practically
states that any successful (especially family based) action film will have a
follow up,in the interests of franchising and,well,basically making
money.And it's certainly the family that TMNT2 appeals more to.It's a much
lighter,sillier and more family friendly feeling outing,in comparison to the
dark,grimy feel of the original.The Shredder,for instance and most
significantly,manages only a fraction of the dark,menacing vibe he gave last
time and for the most part completely lacks substance here.There's a scene
in which the Tokha and Rahzor monsters clamber up and cuddle him that
forcefully strips him of all the fear and respect he commanded from the last
film.To a degree,the same could be said of Tatsu,although in fairness,he did
carry a slightly bumbling quality to him in the original.That's not to
mention a number of woefully under-used supporting characters,such as April
and Chief Sterns.And what the hell happened to Casey Jones?!?

Of the new characters the new film introduces,Ernie Reyes Jr. emits a fairly
engaging charisma as kung fu fighting pizza delivery boy Keno and David
Warner is impressive as bumbling professor Jordan Perry (or maybe the film
holds too much sentimental value for me!)

One of the main compounding factors of the film (in my eyes) was the plot
(or,rather,lack of it) that at best feels very slight and at worst feels
practically non-existent.The film is very short,so the feeling of it all
being slapped together to make money is never far in doubt.Yet,for all
this,the film still manages to carry a charm all of it's own.The
script,though patchily assembled,still manages to be engaging throughout and
the Jim Henson creature shop creations are as well made,colourful and
pleasant to the eye as you'd expect.And hey,when even a Vanilla Ice cameo
can't spoil it,something has to be right.***

<|_=00=_|>

This film opens with tremendous confidence and energy. The humor of the
Turtles may be so 1990 but I still dig it. The opening scene in the
shopping mall is way funny and a great way to introduce is to the
sequel. At the time the style of the Turtles wasn't so stale, so the
plot may seem a bit childish or dumb now.

I have no doubts that if this movie were made today it would not be
subtitled 'The Secret of the Ooze'. One can hardly expect high art from
a movie called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II but they could have
subtitled it something a little less crass. Apparently taking place
right after the first movie (where's Casey) it wastes no time bringing
back the Shredder and the rest of the Foot Clan.

This time Shredder aims to steal the cannister of ooze that mutated our
heroes so he can make his own monsters to avenge his defeat. The result
is Tokka and Rahzar and it seems like a half-attempt at a live-action
version of Rocksteady and Bebop. As you can imagine, this plot isn't
very clever. But the movie never really lulls so long as our heroes are
on screen.

Look out for a cameo by Vanilla Ice (looking alarmingly like Dolph
Lundgren) at the end. It's so dated it may be difficult to watch but as
long as your alone you won't have to cringe.

The DVD has wonderful motion menus as well as a great 1.85:1 anamorphic
picture with Dolby 5.1 sound. Extras are thin but still it's a great
buy.

<|_=00=_|>

Well, this second film was more kid-oriented and played more for laughs,
but
I still got a kick out of it. Paige Turco made a better April than Judith
Hoag (and what a cool apartment April has!) and Ernie Reyes Jr. (whatever
happened to him?) is a lot of fun to watch too. What WAS the secret of the
ooze? I haven't seen the film in years!

Re: Vanilla Ice. Yes, his very presence is laughable, let alone his
"performance". But in his defense, he's less embarrassing here than in
1991's other blockbuster smash hit, Cool As Ice!
<|_=00=_|>
There really is no point in going over everything once again for
newcomers who should really watch the harmless and entertaining first
movie anyway.

This time around we get a new April O'Neil (Paige Turco, a vast
improvement over her predecessor), no Casey Jones, a little bit of mad
science, a returning Shredder, some little athletic kid who kicks
people to the ground in between delivering pizza and some great enemies
for the turtles to try and destroy. Oh, and as the title would suggest,
there's a more prominent role for the ooze that helped make the turtles
what they would become and that's the main thrust of the plot: that
ooze and how it is to be used/abused by those who get their hand on it.
Simplicity itself.

This is, let's be frank now, not a great movie. And yet, somehow, it
kept me entertained throughout and actually left me with a big grin on
my face in places. Perhaps it was the familiarity of the characters,
perhaps it was some of the genuinely half-decent action sequences,
perhaps it was even just the excuse all these years later of STILL
being able to laugh at Vanilla Ice (oh, do watch for that scene as it
is priceless).

Nostalgia is all well and good in small doses but, thankfully, this
movie was amusing, light and entertaining enough in a standard family
movie way to pass the time without too much pain.

See this if you like: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Double Dragon, Tank
Girl.

When I saw the first debut of the turtle's  movie I did not want to miss a
second. And I did'nt. When the 2nd one came out I loved every second as
the
1st, and to this day I still have the collection, and the credit I want to
give to is the puppeteers and the suit performers they were awesome
bringing
those characters to life. Great Job. My full respect for these movies is
still strong. Some say I'm too old to watch it still. I don't think so!
TMNT
Rocks. Let's keep it that Way!
<|_=00=_|>
I just finished watching this movie. I thought about watching it,
because I recently saw the first one which I also wrote a review on. I
also felt like watching it, because you remember how the turtles like
pizza and in this one, one of the main characters is the pizza delivery
guy, Keno. While watching it, a lot of the movie didn't entertain me
that much. It might have a good storyline, dealing with the ooze the
turtles mutated from. But, a lot of the movie seemed too kiddish for
me. Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of kid entertainment. Like my
favorite movie in the entire world, which I also left a review on is a
movie called Junior High Spy, even though that movie has bad acting. I
also feel like if you want to go to places like Disney World, you still
have some of your youth inside. Sometimes if something is too kiddish,
it just seems too cheesy to watch and doesn't entertain you as much.

Now, there's the first one which is entertaining. I enjoyed the first
film, I like the dark atmosphere in the film. I also like how they show
the Foot Clan and teen boys from back then entertaining themselves.
This movie is the 2nd in the series, and we miss the days when the
turtles were stuntmen in costumes. This movie while meant to be a
sequel from the first, seemed to leave things out as sequels often
times do. I mean, April seems to change in this one. Yeah, she's played
by a different actress. But, in this one she lives in a nicer apartment
in a nicer area of the city. She also seems to appreciate antiquity in
the first, which isn't shown in this one. Also, Danny was a main
character in the first film who even hung around April in a deleted
ending scene. It doesn't look the same without him, or his Dad Charles
Pennington, especially at April's Channel 3 News. It also isn't quite
the same without Casey Jones, even though Keno probably replaced his
role. The foot also seems different in this film than the first.

What else do I want to say. I saw the 3rd one recently, as I have a Blu
Ray set with the first 3 TMNT movies. I saw on wikipedia how the 3rd
one got mostly negative reviews, including one review of somebody who
considered it only entertaining for kids and almost as if that movie
was written by kids. I don't think so. The 3rd one seems less cheesy,
and it takes us back to 17th Century Japan. Also, I felt like the plot
for that movie was hard to understand, even as an adult. That movie
could also look like you're watching a different movie when you see
ancient Japan. It also is nice to see the turtles in the past, and not
in their typical urban environment, and a villain besides Shredder.
That movie couldn't be written by a kid, I don't think most kids are
really familiar with the Samurai in 17th Century Japan. This second one
seems more like it was written by a kid, as it's a plot a kid could
come up with.

So, the movie entertained me a little. I mean the Go Ninja Go Ninja Go
sequence was cool. The climax while it could have been better was cool.
But, a lot of the movie seemed slow pace, and cheesy. I'm sure the
first one will entertain you more than this one. If you like history,
like me you'd probably prefer the 3rd one. So, for entertainment
purposes and remembering the turtles from when they were men in
costumes, I give it a 5.
<|_=00=_|>
In the early 90s, everywhere you went you'd see something related to
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The craze took the country by storm
and kids like you and I were nuts for it. The first feature film was
both a hit at the box office and with youngsters, so it was only
natural that we get a sequel, right? New Line Cinema wasted no time and
the following year we were given number 2. It too was a hit, but was it
even as good as the original? Some seem to think so, some even like it
more. I like it, but nowhere near as much.

Pros: Acting is decent. More of that corny, yet endearing humor. Moves
at an OK pace. As usual the Jim Henson people did a nice job on the
animatronics. Some breathtaking shots of New York City. The fight
scenes are fun, plus the choreography has improved. A pretty cool final
showdown.

Cons: Lacks some of the energy and fun of the first. Putting everyone
in the middle of a Vanilla Ice concert just dates the film. Plus much
of it feels like they were trying to pad the running time.

Final thoughts: This first of two sequels isn't bad, in fact it's
pretty darn entertaining. But like a lot of sequels that came out a
year or less after it's predecessor, it feels like it was made for
money and nothing more. Still if you're a fan then it's worth seeing.

My rating: 3/5
