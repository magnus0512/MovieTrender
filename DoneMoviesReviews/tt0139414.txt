I love watching this movie. I love this dialog in a "horror" film. I
got myself a copy on DVD and watch it at least a few times a year.
There are some classic lines between the city folk vs. the bumpkins.
Fonda's line about the sarcasm being too subtle is great (while
spraying RAID in the middle of Maine). Betty White is building her
career these days being the tart-mouthed old broad (see "Boston Legal"
- another David Kelley production). Also, the interplay between Oliver
Platt and the actor playing the sheriff are priceless.

Contrary to what others have written - I think the special effects go
just fine with the overall campy and comedy feel of the movie and the
amount of gore is also appropriate. More would change the tone of the
film from the comedy which I enjoy, to one more of a gross-out nature.

Just a favorite of mine. Try it if you, for example, liked "Love at
First Bite" - you will probably like this too.

When a diver is cut in half by something under the water of a quiet lake in
Maine, Sheriff Keough calls in the Rangers, Jack Wells and a New York
palaeontologist, Kelly Scott to investigate a tooth found.  Wealthy
crocodile hunter Hector Cyr swoops in to insist that the creature is a
crocodile.  A claim that looks increasingly likely when the body count
begins to rise.

You really need to be in the mood for a film like this or else you will
likely hate it.  If you love Tremors then you might be the sort of person
that lake Placid is aimed at.  The film's strength is that it is a big silly
B-movie and it knows it. The film lets us know very early on that it is not
100% serious and this then frees us up to enjoy it rather than moaning about
the sheer unlikelyness of the whole affair.

The plot is daft of course, a Jaws rip off from opening sequence to final
attack.  The fact that the script has a great sense of humour makes this OK
Â– so when an old woman feeds a cow to the croc then it's fine because that's
just what you'd expect in this film.  Likewise the humour gives rise to
plenty of funny lines which add to the feeling that the film is about fun
more than scares.  `Is this the man who was attacked?' says Cyr, holding a
toe found by the water `he seemed taller' replies the sheriff.  Of course at
some point the ending must come and it is as overblown as you'd expect, but
even then it has it's tongue in it's cheek (fishing with a
cow!?).

The crocodile effect is a mixed bag.  In some instances it is good while in
others it is over animated and not realistic.  For the most part though it
works well enough.  The cast are not that good but deliver wooden
performances in a good way (if that's possible).  Platt steals every scene
he is in by getting all the funny lines (`yeah well they conceal that sort
of information in books' being a put down I fully intend to use given the
chance).  Pullman is given a less glamorous task of being the leading man
while Fonda is like Ally McBeal in the woods!  Gleeson is great fun bouncing
off Platt and Betty White is so crazy that it's hard not to
laugh!

Overall this is a big budget silly B-movie that laughs at itself.  If you
are not in the mood for that, or can't accept it for what it is then you'd
do well to avoid this film.  For all others there is enough good lines and
silly fun to be had here to help you enjoy it, even if you do forget it
shortly after watching it.

I loved this dopey movie. Funny,with an absolutely hilarious performance by
Betty White, an appealing Bridget Fonda (for the first time in memory), and
very likeable Brendan Gleeson and Oliver Platt. Bill Pullman was fine but
the least of it. What's not to like? I mean, who wouldn't want to save an
alligator that's biting people in half in an unspoiled lake 25 miles from
anywhere in the middle of Maine? There are so many BAD time wasting movies
out there, so much violent, or inane, or vulgar, or sadistic junk that this
tongue-in-cheek tale with its dotty characters and clever ending just has to
be viewed as one of those times to sit back and smile broadly without guilt.
This is hard to pull off, and not to be minimized.

"Lake Placid" is one of my all-time favorite movies ever. The dialog is
sarcastic and funny no matter what's going on, which keeps it light
even with all the people getting eaten every now and then. All the
lines between Hector and the Sheriff are especially noted. Most of the
comebacks I use whenever possible in everyday conversation. Hector's
dream is awesome, though. I love Oliver Platt.

The best part is that it isn't trying to be a scream-out-loud sort of
monster horror movie, it's just having fun. The acting isn't the best,
but the way all the lines are delivered makes up for it, and adds to
it's charm. It really reminds me of one of those cheap Sci-Fi channel
monster movies with the horrible effects, only 10 times better and the
effects are more real, of course. Not perfect, but better then the
Sci-Fi channel. It looked like a crocodile to me. 

So while you can sit there and try to pick out everything that's wrong
with this movie, it's better just to sit back and enjoy it. It's not
pretending to be intelligent and so the movie is best viewed knowing
that. It tells you that itself within the first 10 minutes.

I love genre-bending movies, and especially those that mix horror with
comedy. That puts me dead center of the target demographic of this
film. The plot is pretty silly and there certainly isn't enough action
for anyone looking for scares. What saves it is the script. It's witty
and never takes itself too seriously. The characters are all foils for
one another, setting up some of the most entertaining dialog of any
movie I know.

The plot revolves around a 30 foot Asian crocodile somehow winding up
in a lake in Maine - go figure. What makes the movie are the characters
assembled to do something about it. Bridget Fonda is an annoying
paleontologist who's never before ventured out of her museum. Here, she
plays both the archetypal fish out of water as well as potential
romantic interest for the local game warden, played by Bill Pullman.
The essential characters are rounded out by Brendan Gleeson's dour
sheriff, Oliver Platt's rich and eccentric mythology buff, and Betty
White as the colorful local little old lady with a secret or two.

As I said, reduced to a plot outline, it's pretty unimpressive, but the
verbal barbs that fly back and forth between the characters are what
make the show. It's an "action/horror" movie I could watch with my eyes
shut and still enjoy.

I can't tell you how much fun this movie is to watch.  The cast of
characters and their interactive dialog is just terrific.  It has been
called a bad B Movie.  I hardly think that this is accurate.  This film
is made with skill and charm.  If you laugh you do so because it
was intended that you  laugh.  That's unbelievably hard to achieve.
It's an intelligent effort with excellent Directing.  I love these
characters and the casting is perfect.  Bridget Fonda shows us
what young actresses can really offer a film.  Betty White is at her
best.  Oliver Platt is facinating. Pullman is a great straightman.
The Sheriff made the picture credible. This film will last and be
seen again and again.  I wish that I had made it.

My wife told me to get this movie.  I told her it got terrible, terrible
reviews.  Well, we got it, I wound up watching it and enjoying it much more
than I thought I would.  More a comedy than a horror movie, it was pretty
stupid, knew it was, and treated itself accordingly.  Loved Brendan Gleeson
as the sheriff, and Betty White's part, though small, was wonderfully
eccentric.
<|_=00=_|>

Finally got to see this flick on HBO last night.  It was entertaining.
These days it's tough to find a really good film because of all of the
hype
so your expectations of any movie can be too high.  With Lake Placid what
you see is what you get.  It was fun although the closing credits with the
actor's interviews would lead you to believe this was an Oscar contender.
The special effects were much better than the Deep Blue Sea.  The other
comments for this movie are on the mark highlighting the Oliver Platt and
Brendan Gleeson characters.  Betty White was a hoot.  If you see this
movie
don't take it or yourself too seriously, just have fun.
<|_=00=_|>


As evident from most of the other reviews, people who
have connected with this movie, as I have, connected quite solidly.  It
was
one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  I have not been scared by a
movie since I was 13 years old, so horror movies that take themselves
seriously, like The Blair Witch, are extraordinarily boring and annoying.
But a comedy which isn't trying too hard, as a dumb Adam Sandler movie
does,
to make you laugh but still makes you laugh is an excellent film.  Lake
Placid is it.  The best part was that I couldn't garner a single thing
about
how good or bad the film was from any of the reviews I had read before I
went to see it.  Brendan Gleeson as the hic Sheriff really deserves most
of
the credit for making this film awesome.  But, of course, since he is not
a
big name, you don't ever hear anything about him.  Instead you hear about
Bill Pullman, who is nothing special in this film.
<|_=00=_|>
Campy monster-movie fast-food that pokes fun at itself. Absolutely
devoid of any message, but chock full of absurd parody.

Any movie that opens with a gruff county sheriff listening to "I Think
I Love You" while he fishes can't be taken seriously. And it gets far
goofier than that. The dialog is a relentless parade of one-liners
between the five principals: a paleontologist (Bridget Fonda), a Fish &
Game guy (Bill Pullman), a croc-worshiping professor (Oliver Platt),
the sheriff (Brendan Gleeson), and an eccentric hermit (Betty White).
Oh, and of course, a big creature with a big attitude and a big
appetite.

Great character development; and all of the characters are over the top
except maybe Pullman's, whose routine nice guy persona balances with
the nuts. It's a toss-up who has the most joke lines or who delivers
them with the most punch; as they reel off sarcasm at the speed of a
machine gun. You can almost see the actors winking at the audience, and
they obviously had fun making this. Even the monster (which usually
looks real) performs like a seasoned comic. The only complaint to note
is that once in a while the endless arguing may wear you out.

The story, which utilizes subtle references to big creature movies like
Jurassic Park and Jaws, actually manages to go somewhere. There are a
few clever surprises, and the closing scene is rather unique.

No cerebral activity will be necessary in the course of watching this
movie. Just settle down with some popcorn, and get ready for some good
comic idiocy.
