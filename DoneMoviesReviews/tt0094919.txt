*** stars out of ****.

I liked this more than most people and don't understand why it's so hated.
It is a good film, in my opinion. The special effects are great, the 80's
score ROCKS, the acting is good, gore level is good, everything is
fine.....it delivers the bloody goods!
I recommend it to horror fans! it's better than you'd think.

Two years after the first Krite attack on the Browns's farm, everything
was peaceful in Grover's Bend but there are some remaining Krite Eggs
still left and Brad Brown ( Scott Grimes) has traveled from Kansas City
to visit his grandmother for Easter vacation. Soon the Eggs hatch as it
makes trouble as the Krites has returned and the bounty hunters from
space Ug ( Terrence Mann), Lee ( Roxanne Kernohan) and former town
drunk turned bounty hunter Charlie ( Don Opper) head back to Earth,
will they rescue the humans with the help of Brad or will everyone end
up on the space monsters's menu? 

Very entertaining and action packed sequel that is almost better than
the original and THE only sequel in the series worth watching. What
works here for this sequel is there's more action, bigger special
effects, off-the-wall humor, a more intense and dramatic score, Mick
Garris's directorial debut and of course there's a memorable moment
where Lee the faceless bounty hunter from space looks at a Playboy
magazine and transforms into a beautiful nude blonde centerfold babe
played by B-movie beauty Roxanne Kernohan. Look for Eddie Deezen ( best
known for Mandark on "Dexter's Lab" and Eugene from "Grease") as a
restaurant manager and there's an amusing Freddy Krueger in-joke since
the movie is from Freddy's home known as New Line Cinema.

The Critters have always been cool little monsters, they aren't just
little omnivorous monsters that eat anything that won't run away and
then chase after it. They are smart, clever monsters with their own
language and strategies. The interaction between the characters work,
the acting is great. The gore effects are effective. The story is a
cool continuation from the first movie. The new batch of Critters are
cool and the rampage continues to be fun. But there is one character
that gets killed this go round, but I'm not saying which character. It
was hard watching that character get it. But other then that, I say
that Critters 2 could be anyone's main course of a video feast. 9
STARS.

Two years has passed... Brad Brown (Scott Grimes) is trying to move on
by visiting his grand-mother (Herta Ware) for the easter holiday. The
Bounty Hunters (Don Opper and Terrence Mann) are traveling back to
Earth. Because the Critters were not completed destroyed. The Alien
Eggs were not destroyed. Since Easter is coming, a small town somewhere
in Kansas will discover that the Easter Holiday isn't everything.

Directed by Mick Garris (Pyscho 4:The Beginning, Sleepwalkers, The
Stand) made an enjoyable sequel with better special effects and a bit
more explicit violence. The film looks more like Joe Dante's Gremlins.
This film was a box office disappointment. Critters 3 & 4 were direct
to videos, because of the disappointment returns of Critters 2. The
film also has likable performances by Tom Hodges, Liane (Alexandra)
Curtis, Lin Shaye and Barry Corbin. Eddie Deezen (From Grease 1 and 2
Fame) has a bit part. Filmmaker:Tom Mc Loughlin (Friday the 13th Part
6-Jason Lives, Date with an Angel) has a cameo. Written by the director
and David Thohy (The Arrival, Pitch Black). (*** Â½/*****).

Critters 2: The Main Course was made in 1988, this one had alot of
critters
in it. so the end for the critters aren't over yet as we all wait for the
3rd and 4th to comewhich came out in 1991. I did enjoy this movie as part
of
it was like a cowboy style. I give this movie 10 out of
10.

The Crite eggs hatch on Earth and terrorize the hick residents of the
sleepy hillbilly hamlet of Grover's Bend on Easter Sunday. It's up to
affable teenager Brad (an engaging performance by Scott Grimes),
reformed town drunk turned bounty hunter Charlie (an equally likable
portrayal by Don Opper), tough bounty hunter Ug (the supremely cool
Terrance Mann), and crusty ex-sheriff Harv (a hilariously gruff and
profane Barry Corbin) to stop the ferocious little furballs before it's
too late. Director/co-writer Mick Garris gets the pace cracking in the
lively and exciting second half (the opening half alas drags quite a
bit), stages the Crite attack set pieces with real flair, tosses in
numerous witty dialogue references to other popular movies ("Who we
gonna call? Critterbusters?"), and injects a wickedly funny sense of
twisted black humor to further spice up the proceedings (the definite
sidesplitting sick comic highlight occurs when the sheriff gets munched
by the vicious hairballs while dressed up as the Easter Bunny!).
Moreover, this bigger budgeted sequel boasts better and more elaborate
special effects, with the famous giant man-eating Critterball rating as
one truly impressive sight to behold. The solid acting by an able cast
helps a lot: the lovely Liane Curtis is quite fetching and appealing as
perky newspaper reporter Megan Morgan, Tom Hodge contributes an
amusingly obnoxious turn as snotty punk troublemaker Wesley, plus there
are nice contributions by Herta Ware as Brad's feisty grandmother, Lin
Shaye as the ditsy Sally, and Eddie Deezen as a nerdy fast food
restaurant manager. Insanely foxy and sexy blonde B-movie queen Roxanne
Kernohan positively burns up the screen as alien bounty hunter Lee in
ravishing human guise as a delectable (semi-nude) "Playboy" magazine
centerfold. Mick's wife Cynthia Garris has a brief bit as prison warden
Zanti and sings the uproariously goofy "Hungry Heifer" jingle. Both
Russell Carpenter's slick cinematography and Nicholas Pike's spirited
score are up to par. A fun and worthwhile sci-fi-/horror creature
feature.

I liked this one. Unlike most sequels, it did not deteriorate at all in
quality at ALL. The critter effects were awesome and the ropes pulling
the critters(as in the goofs) were actually not very visible at all.
Just a warning to younger readers; it is not as appropriate as its
proceeder or it's two sequels: in one scene, a woman is seen topless
for about half a second and then she is seen covering herself, there is
also a little more gore in this one, but keep in mind it is a comedy so
it is also a little light and funny. It was a fun movie and the
critters grouping together was cool. The female bounty hunter's death
was surprising. The acting was believable and the story was fun. Over
all, if you liked number one, you'll like number two. I recommend it
for all 12 and up.

With the news of more aliens still on Earth, the bounty hunters set off
to find the lone human they can trust to help them corral the beings
before they spread throughout the town and become too much for them to
handle.

This here turned out to be quite an exciting and enjoyable
horror/comedy that has so much going for it that there's just no
shortage of fun to be had here. The fact that this one decides to get
the creatures out quite early with the discovery of the eggs and the
town becoming aware of what's going on with his reappearance to their
total dismay and a series of isolated attacks that clearly signal the
creatures are back and ready to continue their rampage as before, only
making the creatures as completely oblivious to the others around them
makes for a rather fun time with the different attacks not being
recognized until the mid-way point results in some nice fun. With the
different tactics of trying to get the creatures under control still
providing a lot of laughs as well, it makes for much more fun to be had
when it plays off the previously established guidelines for the series
as well as injecting a lot of clever and sometimes creepy points in
this to add in a horror angle when all is said and done makes this one
a lot more entertaining and enjoyable. There's enough gore in this to
appeal to the more traditional horror fans with their attacks on the
townspeople in the diner, the church and the final attack in the
storage locker not only provide some fun moments throughout with their
fun combination of mixing light-hearted action with some rather
gruesome moments to add up to a bunch of fun times. While there's some
flaws here in that the continuous jokes about the events in the first
film are used to make it appear that he's just insane and should know
better about spreading such information around get tiresome quite
quickly, there's enough to like here that it's enough to overcome the
few flaws.

Rated PG-13: Language, Violence and Nudity.

One of The good things about this movie
is that the
like-able characters from the first CRITTERS
movie returns.
This one is way more gory than the
first one,
but it is still worth a look.

CRITTERS 2 has to be one of the best Sci-Fi/Horror films ever made!!  It's a
blockbuster!!  It is full of great Special-Effects, Fun Characters, and it's
an all-out good time!  I'm surprised that this film doesn't have more
recognition. There's action, suspense, and the countryside town of Grover's
Bend gives the film a great Atmosphere.  Scott Grimes is back as Bradley
Brown, who returns to Grover's Bend to spend Easter Vacation with his
Grandmother.  Unfortunately, some of the Critter Eggs that had been
undiscovered in the Brown's old Barn are about to hatch and the Town is in
for a Big surprise!!  Also returning are Don Opper AND Terrence Mann as the
space-hopping Bounty Hunters who come to finish off what they thought they
had destroyed before!  The Town that never believed Brad Brown suddenly
learns that the Critters are real and must all join forces to try and stop
the critters before they become Lunch!  The Critter Effects are Top-Notch
and the film is fun and exciting!!  Just like the first CRITTERS, Part 2 is
a cult classic and deserves better recognition!!!
