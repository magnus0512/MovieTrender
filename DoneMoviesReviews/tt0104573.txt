This is one of the few, probably the only film in the urban youth genre, a
la 'Boyz in the Hood' and 'Menace 2 Society' that I can truly appreciate. 
This film is as gritty and true to the life as the other films mentioned,
but the story and acting in this film rises it above the rest.  Tupac Shakur
was excellent in his role as Bishop....he came through with a very intense
and harrowing performance.  If you need any convincing as to his talent,
this film will show that.  This was arguably Omar Epps' best performance, he
was VERY convincing as 'Q'.  Where a movie like 'Menace 2 Society' was just
a showcase of the gang life, 'Juice' mixes that with an interesting and
true-to-life story.  It shows the struggle of black youth in a whole new
light; I can't help but feel for Q and his friends because that is something
that could happen to anyone.  A classic for fans of hip-hop
culture.

This is a hip-hop classic that I could definitely relate to being from
NYC,
and having been in a click of four friends since grade school.  The film
has
a great pace and rhythm from start to finish, never a dull moment.  Tupac
displayed the raw talent and anger that resides in most inner city youth
who
simply want respect.  Unfortunately respect came at a price, which the
film
was precisely able to convey, through strong performances by Tupac, and
by
Omar Epps, as the aspiring DJ, in their first featured roles.  Samuel L.
Jackson has a noticeable role as a pool hall owner, and young Queen
Latifah
does her thing as the Ruffhouse MC.  Ernest Dickerson does an excellent
job
with capturing the energy of Harlem in an honest way, not dressed as a
stereo-typical slum or focused on the historic 125th street, but neutral
to
lay the groundwork for the true challenges that living in Harlem has to
offer these four young men. A classic!!

Juice is an urban drama set in early 90's New York City.  It is the story of
four friends who each look to gain respect in the neighborhood one way or
another.  Q(Epps), Raheem (Kain), Steel (Jermaine ...), and Bishop (The
Late? Tupac)have good chemistry as the group of friends looking to earn some
props around the way.  The standout performances were from Tupac and Epps. 
There are many cameos by famous hip-hop celebrities in the film.  The story
is good and there are many memorable lines for those who enjoy this genre. 

The cinematography by Dixon gives you the feel of Harlem during that era. 
This will go down as a classic hip-hop film with a great soundtrack. 
All-in-all this film is a must have if you are a fan of the genre, and a
decent pick-up if you are not particularly fond of these types of films. 

Peace,

Juice is a classic film about four friends and the chocies they make and
the
consquences. The cast all give memorable performances in particular Tupac
Shakur as Bishop. The film also features a young Omar Epps. The soundtrack
is also one of the best soundtracks ever made for a hip hop film. I love
this movie.

Wow, the memories. This is one of my favorite hip hop flicks. I'm also
a Tupac fan and I can honestly say when I first saw this movie.. I
hated Tupac because he made the "bishop" character so real... A little
too real.. Some say Pac's problems started after he made this
film...That he was living out the character... Looking back on it now
as I'm older I think the character helped him release some of the
darkness in his past. I miss Tupac.. When I look at these watered down
rappers ... i.e. 50 Cent.. and how he's still around.. It tells me
people are attempted to fill the Pac void.. There will NEVER be another
Pac.. Please believe it.. Anyway...I watched the move again recently
and it's great the music and the vibe and movement of the film is
gritty and honest. It really shows how small situations in the hood can
become a big problems.. Pac was excellent and raw. Omar Epps was
excellent as well.. I love the movie...It never gets old.

Juice is a film about 4 friends growing up in Harlem, it tells the
story of how far you will go to get respect and how possessive the need
to be respected can be. 

I enjoyed this movie, a good solid hood film. The acting is superb,
especially from Tupac and Epps. Really strong leading performances. The
transformation of Bishop from the start to the end is played out
perfectly by Tupac.

The movie has a great urban old school feel with a belting hip hop
sound track. It's funny, tense, emotional and gritty. Watch this if you
are into this type of genre, even if your not, its definitely worth a
watch.

Top performances from Epps and Shakur make this film watchable, the story
a
fairly mundane one of street youth gangs drifting into crime in search of
kicks, streetcred and "juice" (or power). Shakur is the nutter who leads
the
way on a downward spiral, eager to get involved in any crazy venture and
leading his more cautious friends down with him, Epps the good kid hoping
to
escape the ghetto life through his DJing skills. Uniformly good acting
especially from the two leads, cameos from Queen Latifah and Samuel L.
Jackson, tense atmosphere and a funny, slang-heavy script all act in its
favour, but a lack of originality and a rather mediocre ending bring it
down
a notch or two. Worth a look if it's your scene though.

Juice is one of the Best Black Crime (Hood) movie of its time. Starring
the late Famous Rapper Tupac in a surprisingly great performance. Out
of all the rappers, i would say 2pac is the Best Actor out of the lot.
Ice Cube is another good actor, DMX, 50 Cent and Snoop are OK. Omar
Epps gives a good performance, who delivers some great speeches at the
police station questioning. Juice tells the story of the lives of 4
teens in Harlem. After a robbery goes wrong, they end up in a murder
investigation. There are some great Hip Hop tunes in this movie.
Special appearance from Samuel L Jackson and Queen Latifah. This is
worth the watch, if you enjoy your action movies.

Power...Respect...JUICE.  How far will you go to get it?  Juice is a great
story about four Harlem friends who crave the respect on the streets they
call juice.  The friends are tired of running from gangs, the police,
security guards and so fourth.  They decide they are going to earn the
right
to walk the streets they feel they should.  So the gang of four decide to
grab a gun and stick up the local convenient store.  And all havoc breaks
loose....?  I don't want to spoil it for you.  Includes a great cast of
Omar
Epps, Tupac Shakur, Samuel L. Jackson, and Queen Latifah.  Go out and rent
this movie as soon as you can.  Wait scratch that   go buy it as soon as
you
can.

Its hard to belive that Omar Epps was only about 18 while shooting this film
& 2pac was only around 20, anyways this movie basically is a different style
of african american movies, not showing that everyone in the hood deals with
guns, but 2pacs personality had an amazing change in this movie, it was so
realistic & his acting is just great. This is Omar Epps & 2pacs debut in
movies & both acted very natural. This movie is a lot more convincing &
realistic than Higher Learning, ive actually noticed that 2pac is an
excellent most of his movies r heaps good e.g. Above the rim, gridlock'd &
Gang Related. Anyways i was surprised at how good this film was. I rate this
movie 8.5 / 10
