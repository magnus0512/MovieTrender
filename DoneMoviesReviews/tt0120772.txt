Finally a truly great film from a star of TV's Friends.
Jennifer Aniston is fantastic as a single woman who becomes pregnant and
wants to raise the child with her roommate George, who is gay.
Unfortunately
for her, she ends up falling in love with him. This sets up what is a
nonstandard ending to a romance movie, but the payoff is satisfying enough
that you aren't in the least disappointed.

I thought that this film was terrific.  I read the book years ago, and
 actually thought that the movie was better.  First of all, it makes more
 sense to look at the storyline from Nina's perspective, since she has much
 more at stake than George does. Secondly, the character played by Nigel
 Hawthorne was beautifully written and played, and he didn't even exist in
 the book.  I also disagree with the assertion that George was "boring" in
 this movie.  I thought that Paul Rudd gave a wonderful and moving
 performance, particularly at the Science Fair when he tells Nina how much
 he would love to be a father.  Don't believe the critics -- give it a
 rental.  It's a terrific film.

It's amazing how this sensitive film can be realistic all the time. Although
this is, indeed, a love story, there's no need to give the viewer happy
solutions just to make them fulfilled. Every second of the movie is real,
every emotion, every fact. Justice to Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd.
There's an amazing cast here, including Mad About You's John Pankow and
veteran Alan Alda (all great) but the movie belongs to Jennifer and Paul.
They make you think no one else could do a better portrait of Nina and
George - they were born to do it. Anyone can relate to them at some point.
Congratulations not only for the two, but also for the entire crew who made
this movie - including, of course, the great sensibility of director
Nicholas Hytner. A job well done.

Despite a downright peculiar finish which gives new meaning to the term
'feel-good', "The Object of My Affection" is a careful, perceptive and
insightful comedy-drama about a straight woman and her gay-male best
friend living together. Keeping the obvious sex-jokes at bay, the movie
strives to create three-dimensional people and works most of the time.
This is due in large part to Jennifer Aniston, an easy presence on the
screen. The set-up is pure formula, but the results are occasionally
offbeat, squirrelly, sometimes funny and moving. Story thread with
Nigel Hawthorne as an elderly gay man who gets dumped-on shows the
casual cruelty inherent in gay relationships, and this is handled with
quiet taste. Not everything works in "Affection", but it is remarkably
pleasant and (for better or worse) hetero-friendly. *** from ****

They say you can't help who you love, and people have used that line
forever to make terrible decisions about romance. This movie explores
the idea that while you might not be able to help loving someone, you
can still choose how you respond to that feeling. Choosing wisely is
the difficult part! :) The characters (and not just the main characters
- there are some great sub-plots and well-rounded side characters here)
learn a lot about being realistic (and how & why that can be difficult)
when it comes to romance. Many aspects of this theme are played out,
and in more ways that you'd think just from reading the back of the DVD
cover.

I highly recommend this if you like that class of chick flick that goes
beyond the obvious to ponder some of the deeper questions about love
and the things we do to find it, keep it, and occasionally break our
hearts over it. Like other beautiful movies of this kind (eg, While You
Were Sleeping, French Kiss) the comedy is fairly subtle and
character-based. 

All the elements are there: casting, direction, script (story and
dialogue) and acting are all good. I hope you enjoy this movie as much
as I did!

I especially liked the performance of Nigel Hawthorne in this movie as
Rodney, the companion of a friend. Jennifer Aniston is delightful, and
Paul
Rudd is a treat as well. Jennifer and Paul have great chemistry together,
and although the story is a bit sad, it is an entertaining and light
comedy.
Watch with someone you love!

The Object of My Affection is a very realistic movie about a woman who finds
a good-looking gay man attractive.  Paul Rudd is particularly fine as the
man who befriends Jennifer Aniston's character.  She is very much
disappointed in her old boyfriend's faithless attitude towards her.  Paul
Rudd's character is fun to be with and, even though they have no sexual
encounters, they are both very good friends.  Paul Rudd's character finds an
attractive young man and falls in love.  This upsets Jennifer Aniston's
character.  She should have seen it coming.  The ending is quite wonderful
in that all are able to remain good friends.

Being a gay man myself and having had a similar relationship with a woman, I
found the film very moving and beautifully done.

The Object of My Affection is rather heavily aimed at a gay audience - at
least it seems that way to me.  It retains quite a theatrical feel; there
is
always the feeling that the director is conscious this is a performance,
and
it's not given the "natural" or "polished" feel that accompanies so many
Hollywood movies.
Paul Rudd is perhaps just a little camp of centre for the role of
George -
he is supposed to be interested in the female lead, after all.  However,
it's a tricky balancing act, because if he becomes too convincingly
involved, he becomes the bad guy, so it's perhaps just as well.  Some very
classy moments come from his deriding of ex lover Professor Joelly, and
some
great gay stereotypes are held up for examination along the way.
Particularly amusing was Paul's blind date with the Village People wannabe
ear nose and throat specialist, and of course, the incredibly self-serving
Joelly.
Perhaps surprisingly, the strongest performance of the piece comes from
Friends star Jennifer Anniston.  Struck by the love bug, she admirably
portrays the lover in the bedroom next door, and I defy anyone not to be
moved by her character's deepest lows.  No review of this film would be
complete without mention of Nigel Hawthorne, who very nearly steals the
limelight from Anniston with his marvelously opinionated (but very
likeable)
literary critic, forced to share the love of his life.  Simply put, he's
brilliant.
So why does The Object deserve a 10 in my opinion?  In the end, the
relationships in the movie don't come down to gay or straight, or anything
one can label.  They're honest to goodness relationships between people -
and that's why there is an element of doubt as to who will end up where -
at
least part of the way through.  That's why despite it's light feel, it has
the ability to evoke some really deep feelings of tragedy in just the
right
places.  It's everything you wouldn't expect, which is a wonderful breath
of
fresh air.

I was talking to my friend, and she mentioned this movie, and said she
loved it, and thought I would too. I was flipping through the TV guide
when I saw it was on at 7:00pm I was so excited. 

I watched it with my Dad of all people, and then my Mom thought it
looked good so she joined in, she quipped "I have seen this before in
theaters back in 1997, it was fabulous and sweet"

I think the exact same thing, I will not leave a summary of the film
because so many others have, but I have to say this one was different
for me. I have no problem with Gay homosexual men, and this movie
pulled on my heart strings a couple times and made me cry. I was
nervous at first to see Jennifer Aniston in this role, because what if
she didn't pull it off, and I was disappointed?? Well I wasn't I was
blown away by her dramatic, yet uplifting, and funny performance.

If you haven't yet seen this movie, it is a "must see". it is also
worth owning on DVD
