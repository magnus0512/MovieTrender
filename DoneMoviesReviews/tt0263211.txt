In my opinion, Sener Sen is the most talented actor in the world. In
this movie he acts as a father who has a big family and lots of needs
but so little income. He tries to do moonlighting and works hard after
his normal job. He even does the most embarrassing things for him as we
know he is an officer but he fails in most of them. After all those
(adventures?)things he loses his mind and he runs in the middle of the
city center half naked. Then, he catches the attention of people. He is
now famous and lots of people try to help or take advantage of him.

While watching this movie I admired Sener Sen's act, and I realized
that every person looking after his or her family may do the same as
Sener Sen to take care of their families. 

I hope you will get something out of this movie and enrich yourself by
Sener Sen...
