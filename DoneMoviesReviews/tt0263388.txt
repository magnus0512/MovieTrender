if you run an eye over the cast you can clearly see these are one of the
best actors of Turkish cinema (sener sen, sevket altug etc.) and imho
yavuz
turgul is the best director of Turkey. well, this makes that movie
interesting (and also strong), isn't it?

anyways, golge oyunu is briefly a story about friendship, losers and
existence. i know these are all separate subjects. but, just watch it.
and
also, golge oyunu is the first (and only) fantastic movie experiment of
Turkish cinema as far as i know. look at that, yavuz turgul has directed
"The Matrix" 10 years ago :)
<|_=00=_|>
The one of the very best movie of Tavuz Turgul's cinematography.
Istanbul is the stage(iconographic background)all the characters are of
warriors for their own existence for some reason.Time and city looses
its originality day by day.Only the very best partners can have the
same dream which may takes days. Love is so difficult to reach in that
stage.I am not pessimistic in that point.Istanbul is becoming for
something different from what it was before.True.There also is
something new which is good and inspiring. The movie also carries of an
important reference which reminds traditional "Gölge Oyunu-Karagöz=two
partners arguing all the time for an artificial subject that they
discovered for performance" As a revolutionist I do not agree with the
idea that the movie says ;no way out to get this capitalistic
degradation.
