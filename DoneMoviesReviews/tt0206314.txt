After Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker) buys a car to pick up would-be
girlfriend Venna (Leelee Sobieski) from college in Colorado, he learns
that his brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn), was jailed on a misdemeanor
charge in Salt Lake City. So he decides to pick up his brother first.
During a pit stop, Fuller has a mechanic install a CB radio. They joke
around with truckers, going so far as posing as a woman and setting up
a false date with one. When the prank turns to tragedy, the trucker
seeks revenge.

For the most part, Joy Ride is an enjoyable horror/thriller. It is
loaded with tension and it's easy for viewers to picture themselves in
the scenario, as it's relatively realistic. The horror is formed from
everyday situations, where just a couple bad decisions can lead one
into the sights of a madman.

However, I had to subtract two points for something I very rarely
subtract points for--"stupid decisions" on the part of protagonists. Of
course, some people think that horror films are primarily based on
characters making stupid decisions, but in my view of the genre, even
if such actions are clichéd, filmmakers generally justify such
decisions at least in the context of the film. Too often in Joy Ride,
writers Clay Tarver and J.J. Abrams, along with director John Dahl,
make little attempt at justification. Why don't they just turn the CB
off? Why don't they just ignore the villain? Why don't they call the
police? Why don't they stay in places that are more populated (like the
truckstop)? Why do they keep trusting the villain? While there are some
cursory answers to a few of these questions, taken together, you keep
wondering, "In the film's world, how can someone so stupid be in
college?" 

One possible answer is suggested by the Joy Ride DVD. It contains a
29-minute alternate ending that thankfully has a bit of commentary from
both the director and the writer. The alternate ending is just is good
as the theatrical version, in my opinion, and tries to put a slightly
more logical spin on the film. Our heroes do end up at a police
station, with some police cooperation. However, it was apparently felt
that this alternate (actually the original) ending "didn't work" and
"didn't maintain tension". Abrams felt that involving the police more
directly in the plot removed too much of the focus from our heroes.
Dahl also states that he thought there was too much character
development in the original ending. I beg to differ on all of those
points. Although the revised ending has many positive aspects not found
in the original--especially a Rube Goldberg-like scenario involving
maximum, immediate risk and creating maximum tension, the original
ending may have worked better overall in my opinion.

But Joy Ride is good enough overall to transcend stupid decisions on
the part of the characters. If seen as a sequence of high-tension
scenarios, where logical plot connectors are only secondary to creating
thrilling rides, Joy Ride almost deserves an A (a 9 in my rating
system). There isn't a scenario in the film that's not smart and
inventive in some way. The three principles--Walker, Zahn and
Sobieski--give good performances, and the villain is masterfully done
by Matthew Kimbrough (who provided the body), Ted Levine (who provided
the bizarre, creepy voice), and Dahl, who wisely shows glimpses of him,
but only glimpses. The villain is almost supernatural in his
cleverness, strength and obsession. It's just too bad that we haven't
had a sequel yet.

It would be very easy to overlook 'Roadkill' (the title 'Joy Ride' is known
by here in Australia), especially considering the leads are mainly known for
asinine teen movies. But dig a little deeper and you will see that it is
directed by the underrated John Dahl, also responsible for the crackerjack
thriller 'Red Rock West' a decade ago. Paul Walker ('The Skulls') is very
effective as your average joe college kid, and Steve Zahn ('Out Of Sight')
is even better as his smart ass older brother. Zahn is a talented comic
often better than the movies he appears in, and he is in fine form here. The
chemistry between the two is believable and amusing without becoming tired.
Leelee Sobieski ('Eyes Wide Shut') has yet to make much of an impact on me,
and there's very little to change that here. She is passable but little more
than eye candy as Walker's potential love interest. The real star of the
movie is the mysterious and frightening trucker Rusty Nail ('The Silence Of
The Lambs' Ted Levine). Of course the whole scenario is hugely indebted to
Spielberg's suspense classic 'Duel', but Dahl and co. manage to put a fresh
and exiting spin on familiar material. 'Roadkill' won't change your life,
but it is a genuinely exciting and effective thriller, a real rarity in
Hollywood these days. Hitchcock it ain't but it's a very entertaining
popcorn movie with plenty of thrills and twists. Recommended.

The idea of this movie is actually pretty good; two teenagers do a prank
call on a CB radio, but the prank turns on them. Most teenagers have
probably been in a situation where they themselves made a prank call. At the
very least, everyone knows about it. The film has some excellent shocks
throughout the movie, and all of the 'thrilling' sequences are very intense,
sometimes bordering on the extreme. The plot is pretty good, even pretty
original, as far as I know. The acting is good enough. The characters are
believable and their actions are understandable, most of the time. The movie
has some very good cinematography and some pretty good cinematic effects.
The ending, though a bit far-fetched, was the perfect way to end it, in my
opinion.
I couldn't have imagined a better way to end it. I recommend this to pretty
much any teen who enjoys thrillers, especially the ones who like to relate
to the theme and plot. Nearly every teenager in the world can in some way
relate to at least one of the main characters in this film.
7/10

"Joy Ride" is an extremely entertaining road-set horror/thriller that
was surprisingly quite good. The film is about Lewis (Paul Walker), a
college coed who decides to buy himself a car and take off across the
desert to pick up a would-be-girlfriend, Venna (Leelee Sobieski) in
Colorado for a road trip together. He then learns that his older
troubled brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn) has been arrested in Salt Lake
City, so he picks him up on the way. After having a CB radio installed
into the car, the two take off to pick up Venna, but end up pulling a
prank on an anonymous trucker who goes by the name of "Rusty Nail"
(excellently voiced by Ted Levine) on the CB radio. After the trucker
learns about the prank, he attacks the brothers with his large semi,
but they manage to escape. But soon after they pick up Venna, the
menacing truck driver begins harassing them again, seeking revenge for
the joke they decided to play on him - he'll stop at nothing to get it,
and he's looking for more than an apology.

Reminiscent of "The Hitcher" in quite a few ways, but also a much
different film, "Joy Ride" was a surprise for me. I was expecting
something along the lines of your typical teenage-horror fare, and I
was pleasantly surprised with this intelligent and heart-pounding
little thriller of a film. To start off, the story in itself is very
nicely written and manages to avoid clichés. The characters in this
film are smart, and the audience is rooting for them the entire way
through. There are some excellently orchestrated thrill sequences, one
of them being the really intense chase through the cornfield, among
others, and these scenes are sure to get you on the edge of your seat.

Tension builds slowly during the first 40 minutes or so, and from there
it just goes rampant. The cast is led by Paul Walker, who hasn't
accomplished anything too amazing, but manages to lead the film well
and play his character believably. Steve Zahn in his quirky and funny
older brother, and plays the part suitably. Leelee Sobieski plays the
intuitive girl-next-door friend who ends up along for the ride, and she
also gives a worthy performance. The psycho-trucker villain of the film
is very scary, never really seen - we get to know him through the
frightening conversations on the CB radio, where he makes numerous
threats and has many disturbing confrontations with the group of
friends. Ted Levine, who played the notorious Buffalo Bill in "The
Silence of the Lambs" voices the psychopath, and his voice itself is
creepy enough, and adds to the villain's overall demeanor. The ending
was excellent, and I loved how ominous it was. I really didn't see it
coming, and it concluded on a very unnerving note.

Overall, "Joy Ride" is a superior action-filled horror/thriller that
came as a big surprise to me. It was intelligent, tense, scary, and
very well-written, which was nice because of my semi-low (no pun
intended) expectations going into it. People who enjoyed "The Hitcher"
will more than likely also enjoy this road trip from hell. Very well
done and worth seeing for both horror and thriller fans alike. 8/10.

This turned out to be one the few movies I 
liked that was geared toward a teen audience. 
Steve Zahn and Paul Walker weren't natural 
in the roles as brothers, which embodied 
the very nature of their relationship. While 
the story became rather convoluted near 
the end, Rusty Nail's voice and detached 
presence brought some actual fear to the 
heart of the viewer. While the sound editing 
made this film, the relatively simple yet 
complex plot really turned this film into a 
satisfying movie experience.
<|_=00=_|>

In "Joy Ride", two brothers (Zhan & Walker) get involved with a big rig
driver over the CB radio while on the open road. They set him up as a
practical joke and unleash all hell on themselves as the unseen subject of
their prank,  known only as "Rusty Nail",  turns out to be a maniacal
killer. "Joy Ride" is a well crafted thriller which methodically builds
suspense while avoiding the usual gore and guts of horror flicks. With
only
a few plot holes, this thriller should keep most on the edge of their
seats.
Worth a look especially for those who enjoyed "Duel" (circa 1971) which is
now circulating on cable.

After KILL ME AGAIN and RED ROCK WEST director Dahl has again made a
nice good-looking, really thrilling little B-movie! He must have
watched DUEL (which is still better, maybe the best S. Spielberg movie
ever, and rates 10/10) and has added something here and there. The
Trauma Spielberg handled in his movie is not to be found in here, but
it's still and nevertheless a highly enjoyable, also well photographed
movie with believable actors and a nice twisted ending (improbable,
yes, but still nice). Whereas in DUEL one just had the man (Dennis
Weaver is his best movie) and a truck (without the driver ever to be
seen), Dahl added more characters and a more visible (actually audible)
driver + police, etc, but the basic plot, people running away from mad
truck/driver, is left intact. I just wish more such movies would still
be made today ...

An intense action/horror/thriller directed by John Dahl that stars
Steve Zahn (Stuart Little 2, Sahara), Paul Walker (2 Fast 2 Furious,
Into the Blue), and Leelee Sobieski (The Glass House, Eyes Wide Shut).

This movie is one of the most intense and most psychologically
frightening movies ever made, that includes a shocking surprise ending.
I'm surprised Wes Craven didn't direct this film, it would have been
twice as scary. But John Dahl did a very good job. It is so freaky and
so intensely strong that my heart kept racing. Each action/horror
sequence kept eclipsing the last. Each thrill gets more thrilling and
more shocking as time goes on. Joy Ride is a film everyone that's over
the age of 12 will enjoy. I say 12 because it is extremely intense and
there is some nasty violence in this film that might not be suitable
for people under the age of 12.

Without giving too much away, I can only say never buy a crappy forty
dollar C.B. and prank call anyone you don't know. Bad things could
happen. And believe me, this guy is very dangerous and does not like to
be messed with, little do Lewis (Walker) and Fuller (Zahn) Thomas, and
Lewis's girlfriend, Venna (Sobieski) know. Mwahahahahahahahaha!

My tip...NEVER EVER PRANK SOMEBODY YOU DON'T KNOW! Joy Ride is a
weirdly named title, and yet it isn't. I think it partly isn't because
I can't think of a better name for it, so, yet, I think it's a pretty
good title.

**** out of **** stars.

Joy Ride is a helluva movie. Basically an homage to Stephen Spielberg's
1971 made-for-TV classic Duel, it's the story of three young people
being terrorized by a malevolent trucker.

On his way to pick up his girlfriend from college, Lewis Thomas (Paul
Walker) stops to bail his loser brother Fuller (Steve Zahn) out of
jail. They pass the time by taunting a trucker on their CB radio. Of
course the trucker turns out to be a psycho who terrorizes them until
they finally think they've appeased him by offering him their abject
apologies. But once Lewis and Fuller pick up Lewis' girlfriend (Leelee
Sobieski), things start right up again with increased intensity, and
the realization that this isn't just any trucker. A sense of the
uncanny and possibly the supernatural starts to pervade the film. The
tension is cranked up until by the end I was literally gritting my
teeth and squirming in my seat.

This movie is smart, well directed, and scary as hell. My only
complaint is that I really wanted Steve Zahn's character to die. Highly
recommended. ***1/4/****
<|_=00=_|>

Joy Ride is a good scary movie. What makes the film scary is the lack of a
monster, the villain is a real crazy guy who can easily find you.John Dahl
makes the film suspenseful with it's dark tone and swift camera angles and
the cast all play their roles effectively. I give it *** out of
****.
