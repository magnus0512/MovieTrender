The Addams Family are one of the more recognisable families in TV history.
With that in mind, let's skip the introductions and get straight to the
chase.

The performances in this movie are superb. It's a black, black comedy, and
as such, it requires a certain kind of actor. The kind who has the right
look, the perfect comedic timing, and the ability to deliver lines so
deadpan it almost hurts.

Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, and a young Christina Ricci somehow ALL manage
to deliver. They're truly a delight to watch, delivering the most macabre
lines without even coming close to cracking a smile, yet having me in
stitches every time. Even Christopher Lloyd, playing a far more energetic
character, manages to bring in a maniacal edge to the performance. I don't
think there's an actor in the movie who doesn't understand the role they
play.

The script is great material for them to work with too, extremely witty,
rarely if ever falling on it's face, and complemented with some fantastic
sets. And let's not forget the music. From the legendary theme tune, to the
harpsichord jingles accompanying the visual gags, to the booming organs
during the heavier moments, it's spot-on. The whole movie works as one to
capture *THE* Addams atmosphere, macabre as it's ever been.

Sure, there's a plot too, but while it drives the movie on, you'd watch this
movie for the wonderful theme, not for an intriguing plotline.

It's a classic, and you're doing yourself a disservice if you haven't seen
it, or if you think you're too sensible for this kind of
movie.

So here it is: a feature look into the lives of the ghoulish family
that bears the name of their creator. In this case, Morticia (Anjelica
Huston) and Gomez (Raul Julia) are raising their family, when long lost
Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) rejoins the family. But there may be
other people who want the Addams' house.

Most people don't seem to realize that "The Addams Family" actually had
some social commentary: everyone outside the Addams house considers
them weird because they live differently, but they're actually a very
loving family. As it was, "The Addams Family" was always better than
"The Munsters" (cleverer and not as silly). But anyway, this is the
feature, and it's one of the few TV-to-movie adaptations that got it
right.

"The Adams Family" is a very funny film that is very under rated. With
a great all star cast you get just what you expect, a great comedy. The
TV show was already funny enough, and then the movie came and I was on
the floor laughing. It's fun to see a happy dysfunctional family. No,
I'm not talking about "The Osbornes". All the characters are great and
you really get into it. If you can tell me that you honestly did not
get one laugh from this film, there is something very wrong with you.
Because it is a very funny film. I would recommend this to anyone. It's
a good watch on any day.

The Addams family are far from being normal but they are rich and as
such are their attorney's only chance of getting rich. Tully has debts
up the yazoo and the only thing that stops his knees being violently
replaced with fresh air is the fact that Abigail Craven's son Gordon
looks eerily like Gomez's missing brother Fester. Shaving his head,
Gordon enters the Addams home as Fester and tries to use his spare time
to get into the family vault. However Gomez's joy at his return is
gradually marred by a sneaking feeling that Fester is not himself Â–
meanwhile Wednesday has no such doubts at all and is out to expose the
impostor.

One of the few remakes that actually works, The Addams Family takes the
Gothic humour of the TV series and makes it feel fresh and
entertaining. The story is essentially a nail for us to hang our coats
on so we can watch the gags come but even with this it is actually
pretty good. Making one of the family a "new character" is a clever way
of adding to the formula without having to bring in new characters to
lead the film and it does work. Within this frame the twisted comedy is
rather entertaining and, although rarely laugh out loud funny, it is
still consistently amusing and enjoyable.

The cast are roundly good. Julia is a perfect Gomez and Huston is a
great Morticia despite the latter being a fairly one-note affair. Lloyd
is enjoyable in the lead and manages to do well to carry the "new
character" aspect of Fester without disrupting the dynamic of the
family. Ricci is excellent and the only downside is that the film
doesn't give her enough to do; Workman is also good and has good
chemistry with her. Hedaya, Wilson, Ivey and others are strong in
support and generally do well to shore up the story.

Overall a kooky affair that is enjoyable in you are in the mood for its
particular brand of dark silliness. The plot is more than enough to act
as a frame, the jokes maybe don't hit many real highs but they do
consistently get very close to the target and the fact that the actors
all buy into the joke makes it that little bit better. An enjoyable
remake that succeeds because it has the strength to stand as its own
beast.

Charles Addams' dark characters get the film treatment in Barry
Sonnenfeld's THE ADDAMS FAMILY, which is something of a cross between
the actual New Yorker comics and the 1960s television show. Not trying
to lean too far to either, the movie stays at a safe plane, even
incorporating a vague plot involving two grifters, Gordon and Abigail
Craven, posing as Uncle Fester and a renowned psychiatrist (Christopher
Lloyd and Elizabeth Wilson) who are in cahoots to rob the Addams of
their fortune and house. The problem arises when Craven seems to go
against his take-the-money-and-run attitude and when the Addams
themselves appear to enjoy every minute that they're being taken
advantage of. It suits the dark humor well, because since the Addams
live in an alternative universe of their own creation in which dark is
light, repugnant is beautiful, pain equals pleasure, death is life, and
chaos equals order, it leaves the door open for many of their Gothic
eccentricities to pull the rug over Lloyd and Wilson over and over
again. It's clever, although its only problem is the "needing to
introduce the characters we all know" setup which like in all movies
based on comics or television shows, looks obvious.

But despite this, everyone is uniformly excellent. Raul Julia and
Anjelica Huston lend their looks to embody their cartoon counterparts
and are the romantics at the heart of this decidedly perverse story.
Christopher Lloyd is also great in his representation of Uncle Fester.
But hands down: the one who walks away with the entire movie is
Christina Ricci who plays Wednesday as if she were living the role day
by day. There's a sadistic gleam in her eyes and her voice that not
many child actors have and I think that any other actor of the time
that this film was made would have been unable to fit into this
difficult part. Other than that, the tone of the movie is perfect: as
dark as it wants to be, but never letting its Gothic setting drown it
in an inescapable mire. On the contrary, we're constantly aware that
this is a typical American family who lives upside down and who are
happy in being so even when we gawk and cringe at their oddities.

Generally, speaking this a pretty "fun movie" for most people, kids and
adults. I think "fun" is the adjective most people would use in
describing this film.

As one who remembered the television series, I thought I would check
this out, too. Angelica Huston certainly didn't match Carolyn Jones'
beauty but she, along with Raul Julia, Christopher Lloyd and Christinia
Ricci all were entertaining to watch.

There certainly were no end to the colorful imagines, unique scenes and
dialog, special-effects and - for those with a surround system, good
sound. It all made for an entertaining and fast-moving film.

I didn't find a lot of laugh-out-loud moments but it did bring a lot of
smiles to my face. A lot of this is dark humor, so it helps to
appreciate that type of comedy.

A good, nay great, movie version to the classic 60s series. Raul Julia is
great as Gomez, as is Christopher Lloyd as Fester. The story is sound,
pretty much better than the sequel. This is a comedy with slightly dark
themes, but that doesn't mean the family can not enjoy it. Barry
Sonnenfeld
is a genius.

Extremely enjoyable update to the old t.v. show retains the eccentric
spookiness and oddball humor of old, then proceeds to update the warped
family familiarity with a rousing sense of decadent glee. The
unexpectedly classy affair benefits greatly from the amazing casting
that went into choosing all the Addams clan. What is nothing short of
ensemble perfection, a sense of fun had by all on set during production
remains undeniably infectious throughout, lending the amusing
proceedings a distinct level of class.

Directed by easily digestible Barry Sonnenfeld, The Addams Family may
be a bit intense for young kids but should stay a delight to all
others. A wonderful, gentle perversity that hangs over the entire
family might have pushed things a little too far to justify this family
film to the younger set, but will stay surprisingly balanced with an
outpouring of heart and morality,simply flipped inside out here, for
comedic intent.

Wonderful set and prop design mixed with it's politely warped sense of
humor would have been enough to make Addams Family the success it
became, although it was the brilliant casting which continues to uphold
a credibility for this film. Led by the outstanding (and sadly missed)
Raul Julia, nearly every single family member wears their role with an
unreal amount of dignity, making the fairly standard plot completely
memorable.

This film is very good.The late,great Raul Julia,Anjelica
Huston,and
Christopher Lloyd performed well.Even though there is a sequel this
film
is one of a kind.In My opinion this is a good dark comedy for
everybody!

The Addams Family has had a death... Fester Addams. But lo and behold,
their lawyer knows a man who resembles Fester and if he passes the
impostor off, could gain access to the family vault, full of treasures
untold. But can the fake Fester survive the family's maniacal games? 

I don't have much experience with older incarnations of the Addams
Family. So, I can't make an educated comparison. However, this film
excels in every way: macabre, humorous and just plain eccentrically
absurd. The casting is also amazing... Raul Julia in the performance of
his career, and Christopher Lloyd in a very offebeat role even for him.

This was a breakout performance for Christina Ricci (playing Wednesday
Addams). Sure, it possibly typecast her into weird roles ("Casper",
"Sleepy Hollow", "Pumpkin") but this is, beyond a doubt, where she
fits. She can do drama ("Monster", "Black Snake Moan") but will always
be America's goth girl.

This film's dark humor is family appropriate -- cartoon violence, no
nudity and marginal language. They simply do not make films like this
anymore. Full credit must be given to the writer and director for
bringing this family to life in a way that just cannot be repeated.
Well, aside from the sequel.
