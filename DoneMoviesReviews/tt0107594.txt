Oddly, this movie is billed as a comedy but I think it was more of a 
drama and, coincidentally, since it was a mixed mag, so is the lead 
actor in here: John Cusack. He is acceptable, but nothing super. 

Cusack plays an ordinary guy, "Joey Coyle," who accidentally finds a 
million dollars and then tries to keep it. Supposedly, it's a true 
story (or at least based on one.) What happens to Joey and his million 
bucks (which had fallen out of an armored car) is not a story of joy 
and happiness. That's justice, since the honorable thing would have 
been to turn the money in, to where it belongs, so there are moral 
lessons taught in this story.

What happens - a mixture of drama, comedy plus action and suspense - 
was pretty entertaining to watch. I wouldn't call this a "keeper," 
meaning a movie to buy and add to one's collection, but it's worth a 
rental, especially if you enjoy watching Cusack perform. I have found 
him to be a consistent actor. In dramas, I think Cusack can be 
outstanding ("The Grifters," "Eight Men Out," "Identity," etc.) but in 
comedies, he stinks ("Bullets Over Broadway," "The Road To Wellville," 
"Grosse Pointe Blank," etc.)

Also, the rest of the cast includes some real characters, many of them 
out of a mob movie: actors like James Gandofini, Elizabeth Bracco, Debi 
Mazur, Michael Rapaport, Michael Madsen, Benicio Del Toro, Maury 
Chaykin and Philip Seymour Hoffman - not exactly the kind of actors 
you'll see in a light, sweet comedy! Halfway through this film I 
wondered if the writers knew where they were going with the story. I'm 
not sure they knew, but at least it entertains.

"Money For Nothing" is a watchable little movie, but nothing
spectacular. How could it be really, when it's based on a premise
that's not particularly interesting in the first place? A guy finds
some money and the police is looking for the money. There you go.

The real reason to watch this is the amazing cast, which wasn't very
well known yet in 1993 when this movie was made. Michael Madsen,
Benicio Del Toro, Philip Seymour Hoffman and James Gandolfini all in
one movie, that's really a treat. The shining light, however, is the
leading star himself. This may not be John Cusack's best movie, but it
may very well be his best performance.

"Money For Nothing" suffers a bit from the fact that it can't decide
whether it wants to be a drama, a crime story or a comedy. Still, it
makes for an enjoyable viewing. Catch it, if it's on TV.

Joey Coyle (John Cusak) is a young man of twenty-six years old and without
any perspective in life: unemployed, with basic level of instruction only.
Living with his brother's family and his mother. One day, when he is coming
back home with his friend Kenny Kozlowski (Michael Rapaport) after not being
hired to work in the dock, he finds 1.2 million dollars that felt from an
armored car. He decides to keep the money, and this is the beginning of a
series of stupidities, in a true story. Being a simple man, Joey has no
malicious and does not know how to handle with such amount of illegal money.
This movie alternates action, comedy and drama and entertains. The cast is
great. My vote is seven.

With the cast listed above how could you not watch? Not a great movie but
very entertaining. It's easy to put yourself into the character of John
Cusack. What would you do if you found 1.2 million dollars in the middle
of
the street? The film also does a good job of displaying the hardships of
being on the run and doing and not doing the right thing. I mean towards
the
end I was stressed out and I was sitting in bed watching the movie.
Decent
flick, worth a watch for fans of any of the above talent. It's laways
good
to remember that movies have come along ways since the early 90's too.
6/10

This movie made about as much money in its theatrical release as Joey Coyle
found in the road. And that's a damn shame. (I was 1 of the few people who
saw it the weekend it opened and closed) While it's not a great movie,
there
are so many talented actors in it, and the story is so sadly compelling
that
all I can do is say watch it.
<|_=00=_|>

What would you do if you'd accidentally find 1.2 million dollars? Take it,
although it's illegal and the whole police will be on your trail? Or
return
it, get a 20.000 dollars reward, but live patiently, with no
problems?
That's the theme of the movie and the lucky guy that finds the money is
John
Cusack.
Worth to watch, but still too simple plot (it's a theme that could've lead
to great situations), predictable ending, poor acting and not tensed at
all.
Vote: 5 out of 10.

Unemployed South Philadelphia dockworker John Cusack (as Joseph "Joey"
Coyle) can't even get picked for day work by his own brother James
Gandolfini (as William "Billy" Coyle). Still, he gets a tuna sandwich
to share with buddy Michael Rapaport (as Kenny Kozlowski). On the road,
the men are behind a truck when something falls out onto the street.
Thinking it might make a good tool box, Mr. Cusack stops retrieves the
container, which turns out to enclose $1.2 million...

His friend advises turning in the money for a reward, but Cusack wants
it all...

A "Tareyton" smoker, Cusack would rather fight than switch. Realizing
the smiling Ben Franklins need to be "laundered," Cusack brings a
portion of the cash to former Catholic school classmate-turned-hood
Benicio Del Toro (as Dino Palladino) and his gangster boss Maury
Chaykin (as Vincente Goldoni). Cusack also finds out how easily money
can get ex-girlfriend Debi Mazar (as Monica Russo) aroused. Like Dire
Straits said, "Money for nothing" gets you "chicks for free." 

While all of this is going on, detective Michael Madsen (as Laurenzi)
is trying to find the missing money...

This is an entertaining picture by Ramon Menendez and his crew, but the
winning situation (poor Philadelphia guy gets a chance to be rich)
might have worked better as a drama; possibly, the project started as
such and changed direction. The film begins with the dramatic phrase,
"Based on a true story." This telegraphs the outcome and removes some
of your investment in the lead character, unfortunately; many people
(like me) being unfamiliar with the real-life Joseph John Coyle.

"Money for Nothing" shows us what one man did when he found that sum in
the
streets of South Philly and learned that "finders-keepers" is not an easy
caveat to abide. A not-to-be-taken-seriously light drama full of familiar
faces which rolls along with tongue-in-cheek, "Money for Nothing" makes
for
a fast moving sofa spud watch now on broadcast. (C+)

In Philadelphia, Joey Coyle (John Cusack) can't even get a day's work
at the docks from his brother Billy (James Gandolfini). While Kenny
Kozlowski (Michael Rapaport) is driving him home, they find $1.2
million that fell off of an armored truck bound for Trump's casino.
Kenny refuses to take any of the money. Joey asks his ex-girlfriend
Monica Russo (Debi Mazar) who works in investments to help. He goes to
bookie Dino Palladino (Benicio Del Toro) who takes him to Vincente
Goldoni (Maury Chaykin) to launder the money. Detective Laurenzi
(Michael Madsen) is investigating the case.

John Cusack is not dumb enough for this to be funny. This character is
an idiot. He can't even do basic math under duress. I've never bought
Cusack playing an idiot. It would work better if Joey is played by a
comedian who does stupid well. Don't get me wrong. I like Cusack and I
like this movie ... to some extent. Joey is such an idiot that it would
be a great black comedy if the movie is cast right.

The movie is based on true story (book is called Finders Keepers).
Having read the book, I was interested in seeing this one. The book's
tone was that of a light comedy.

**Possible Spoiler** Dumb crooks do stupid things which is why they get
caught.

The scenery is South Philly - so you may be reminded a lot of Rocky or
Invinciable. I guess it's hard to make a poor dumb guy down on his luck
comedic. If the screenwriter had been able to pull it off, it would
have been a much better movie. As it is, it's just OK.

The difference between this and a caper movie is the suspense that
leads up to the crime. Here, it's just an accident. And believe me, the
wrong guy was at the wrong place at the wrong time. The IMDb rating is
accurate - somewhere between a five or six, depending on your mood or
how much you like John Cusack.
