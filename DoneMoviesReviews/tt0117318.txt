I went into this one fully expecting to like the heck out of it, and I
wasn't disappointed. No one had to convince me the message was a valid one,
but I still thought I'd drop a line to say that I thought it was a very well
done movie. It shows how a right that is supposedly near and dear to us all
is often skewed in favor of mollycoddling lots of hypocrites who has the
ridiculous audacity to think they have the right and the obligation to tell
the rest of the world what to think of as moral or immoral. I loved the
scene where Woody Harrelson, who does an absolutely bang-up job, gives a
speech about how explicit depictions of death, murder, and war are
considered appropriate while sex is considered filthy. "Sex or war" indeed.
The more of Harrelson I see, the more my respect for his work grows. I must
also mention Courtney Love, who is terrific as Althea. Great movie, I
thought. Most of the people who don't like it are probably also the very
ones it portrays as being the "bad guys"-the religious right, of course.
Larry Flynt may not be admirable in the type of lifestyle he and Althea
lived, and his magazine is, to my mind, entirely repugnant. But if Larry and
Althea truly had the sort of relationship portrayed they loved each other
beyond all reason, and what he did makes him a great patriot. How many
people would do what he did in defense of such an idealistic belief? Not all
people who do great things for great reasons are great people.

As Larry Flynt is hardly the usual type of person you think of when you
think of the word "hero," it's fitting that this biopic opts not for the
standard approach, but to make an offbeat comedy(as writers Scott Alexander
and Larry Karaszewski did in their screenplay for ED WOOD and the upcoming
MAN ON THE MOON, about controversial comedian Andy Kaufman).  You may not
like him(and one of two faults I had with this film was I think the
filmmakers lionized him a little too much), but certainly any society which
calls itself free needs to make room for him.  Harrelson does a good job in
the title role, but the real force for me came from Courtney Love, in an
astonishing performance as Flynt's wife, and Edward Norton, one of the best
new talents, as Flynt's reluctant lawyer.

Besides that it does lionize Flynt a little too much, there is one problem I
had, though.  If you believe the film, all of Flynt's opposition came from
right-wing blowhards like Charles Keating and Jerry Falwell.  Certainly,
they did have the most publicized tussles with him.  But to ignore the
problems he had with feminists makes it rather limited.  I don't agree with
Gloria Steinhem's contention that the film ignores his depraved side, but I
think the film would have been more interesting if it had addressed the
opposition he had from both the left and the right.  Still, this is a
terrific and important film to remind us what freedom really
is.

Idealized biography of Hustler magazine mogul Larry Flynt (played superbly
by Oscar nominee Woody Harrelson) which finally ends up focusing on his
legal battles to publish his pornography via the free speech laws of this
land. Along the way he marries a bisexual wild woman (Courtney Love) who
shares his unconventional views on free love, priced pornography and drug
abuse. The character also survives an assassin's bullet, paralysis,
imprisonment, endless court battles against the Reverend Jerry Falwell and
even his own destructive nature. Edward Norton (a relative newcomer when
this was released) shines as Harrelson's young attorney who tries to
overlook and overcome his client's tirades. Director Milos Forman
(Oscar-nominated) does a good job creating a cinematic story about a man who
is hard for most in mainstream society to understand or relate to. Flynt is
humanized and so are those who cross his path throughout the picture. The
movie is not as wild and crazed as one would think. Instead Forman uses
well-timed comedy with drama to get the major points across effectively.
Overall one of the better films of 1996. 4 stars out of 5.

Before watching this movie, I had nearly no idea who Larry Flynt was. I read
a quick summary a few minutes before watching it, but I hardly knew any
specific details. After watching it, I know exactly who he is, and what he
stands for. He stands for freedom of speech. Some might call him a pervert.
Others call him a patriot. I believe he is the latter. While I don't know
the exact story of Larry Flynt from any other sources than this movie, I
don't know if it's completely accurate. The plot is great, for a biographic
piece, the acting is superb, by most actors, especially the three main
characters. Most of the cinematography fits the movie perfectly. The only
thing that bothered me a little, was there was relatively little information
about why Larry Flynt did what he did, believed what he believed so
strongly. I sympathized with his character in several scenes, but I never
fully understood him. The director should have had at least a few more
emotional scenes with Larry, to explain his actions better. Overall, a very
good drama. Recommendable to most fans of the genre, as long as they can
stand what the movie shows them. If you have an open mind, you're not too
easily offended and you're into autobiographical dramas, this is a good film
to watch. 8/10

Anyone familiar with Milos Forman's work will know how much he likes to
discuss and examine controversial real-life characters and make them the
focal point of his films. Amadeus for one was a powerful expose of the
legendary composer; Forman was able to extraordinarily add so much spice to
the script that the end result was a harrowing documentation that genuinely
moved us. We didn't need to know anything about the composer or even like
his work or personality; Forman craves on these sorts of challenges. He
likes to make films about characters that the audience may not identify
with
because it heightens the overall achivement if the film  is a hit. With
Larry Flynt he's done it again.

Flynt is the story of Porn magazine chairman larry Flynt who amidst an era
of overwhelming decadance launched Hustler magazine, a porn magazine that
broke all taboos and crossed all boundaries. The magazine was a huge hit
that transformed Flynt into a powerful figure in the American Community.
Needless to say though, Flynt (superbly played by Harrelson) faces
insurmountable odds from everyone to keep the business running.
Politicians,
reverends, mass public opposition et.al.. Flynt is accompanied along the
way
by his junkie wife (played with real panache by Courtney Love) and a
reluctant lawyer (dependable performance from Edward Norton Jr.). At the
midway point of the film Flynt is shot and paralyzed and consequently the
fight to stay on top is made even more challenging.

This story is intriguing because is dares to break universal taboo's. It
shows Flynt disassociating himself from the norms and traditions of society
and really willing to take genuine risks that could blow up in his face.
Before Hustler was formed, Playboy was the porno pioneer. Playboy was
subtle
in it's nudity, preferring to call itself a REAL magazine rather than
something trashy. We notice that Playboy was afraid to overstep the
barrier.
Playboy was a magazine that was restricted in it's disclosure of barenaked
ladies because of the shape of society at the time and the values the
society had come to embrace. To call yourself a porno magazine was
unthinkable with unthinkable consequences! Hustler dared to step over those
lines and bear all the consequences. Flynt was not necessarily a likeable
man but he cannot not be admired. He was a risk taker, an enterpeneur, a
man
with a vision, and a man who believed that oe should act on one's desires
and ambitions.

The mass hysteria the swamps the society as a consequence mainfests how
powerful yet dangerous a little "acting on ambition" can bring. Flynt's
idea
is impossible to resist; the public cannot stay away from the controversial
impact of the magazine. As the fan base grows, so does Flynt's empire, and
so do the forces determined to suppress him. Flynt's meteoric rise is
unprecedented, and made all the more shocking by the fact that the evnets
are real. His opposition ranges from hypocritical politicians to dubious
religious figures, all of whom are hell-bent on the abolition of Flynt and
his tremendous reach.

The film earns huge plaudits on the entertainment level. This is
undisputed!! The acting demonstartes tremendous range from all involved and
Flynt is an offensive yet endearing, and very funny figure. We grow to
really love and root for him as the film develops. The points that
necessitate discussion however are the legal and moral issues that are
debated by Flynt, his lawyer, and the opposition. The freedom of press, of
speech, and the freedom to exercise your FREEDOM are all fiercely debated.
Flynt vehemently defends his position because he feels that the world is
afraid to agree with him, that the world is afraid to speak out. The world
is polluted by hypocrits; he's the only pure seed. This presents tremendous
irony because Flynt is a low-class pervert up against scholars, and
politicians, and bureaucrats, and yet he's claiming that he's the real deal
and they are all phonies. He has a point; what's the point in looking
presentable and being well-educated if you are  banal, hollow, and insipid
and cannot open your mind to new ideas?? The film asks that question; we
see
how closed off the men in power are to Flynt's ideas and we grow to hate
them. Then we are torn because we are reluctant to accept the values of a
porn fiend. The fact that we cannot resist Flynt's pulling power is the
sign
of the film's success. We start off opposing Flynt, unable to identify.
Then
we try and take a neutral stand as we discover the ugliness of Flynt's
opponents. Finally, after Flynt is paralyzed and yet continues to defend
his
honour, we can no longer resist the seduction.

The film has Flynt giving amazing speeches about why he is doing justice to
himself and the people. He's giving them what they want,they are taking
it,and yet they are determined to censor him. He debates this point to
manifest the outstanding hypocrisy that lies at the heart of society. Flynt
is such an important character because he speaks for all of us. On
countless
occasions, we all seek to expose the two-faced ugliness of those around us.
We just can't because not enough people are listening. Flynt however gets
eveyone's attention and defends his honour, preserves his integrity, and
succeeds in winning over the justice system. The final speech given by
Issacman, his lawyer is very insightful and very powerful for it argues
this
very point: 'We don't need to like what Larry Flynt does, but we should
like
and appreciate the fact that we have the right to make that decision on our
own, and that's what makes our society great. We have the right to accept
or
reject the offer on hand. We may well reject it but we and we alone need to
have the choice made available to us. If that right is taken away, then we
wither away as a people and our individuality is nullified' The speech is
amazing because it demonstrates how the right to accept a porn fiend and
his
work preserves the democracy of the Western World. Truly Shocking but
brilliant!!!

I haven't discussed the other characters all that much and I'm not going to
except say this: All the characters are multi-dimensional because what we
see on the outside is never what we get on the inside. Flynt for all his
crude, perverted behaviour is an admirable, likeable, highly identifiable
personality. His wife, for all her vulgarity and drug addiction is an
endearing, loyal,intelligent personality. Issacman, the lawyer, for all his
traditional, stiff boring work ethic, is an idealistic, shrewd, and deeply
committed man....The list goes on and on

I loved this movie because our hero is not perfect; he's anything but!!!
Movies that depict the hero as a flawed individual stand a better chance of
being embraced by critics and audiences alike. Flynt thrives on this! And
exposing hypocrits for their true selves is every cynics (and I happen to
be
a huge one) dream. Flynt's journey is whopping emotional tour de
force!!!!
You don't have to like Larry Flynt as a film, but I love the fact that I
had
the right to make up my own mind!! Society, you ignore that at your
peril!!!

"The People vs. Larry Flynt" is already 8 years old, and the subject it
talks about is even older, but it still hasn't lost anything of it's
relevance. This isn't a movie about Larry Flynt, the porn king. It's
more a movie about the right to say what you want to say, without
having to think of every person's opinion first. 

You may not like the man or what he stands for, but at least he has the
guts to stand up for what he believes in. He defends his right to speak
freely and doesn't mind kicking against the shins of the ultra
conservative Christians. In a way today's America needs more people
like him instead of acting like a bunch of sheep being brought to the
slaughterhouse by their government...

The acting in the movie is very good, but especially Woody Harrelson as
Larry Flynt and Edward Norton as his lawyer were excellent. Courtney
Love isn't really an actress, but still did a good job (not that hard
to do when you play a role that you are quite familiar with in your own
life.)

All in all this is a very enjoyable movie that will be loved by some
and hated by many. Personally I liked it and I give it a 7.5/10
<|_=00=_|>

Oscar Winning Milos Forman's The People Vs. Larry Flynt is a fascinating (if
not too trashy) look at how without the first amendment, people like Flynt
would not exist.  We see an expose on the man, myth and legend of master
porno publisher Larry Flynt (played to damn close perfection by Oscar
nominated Woody Harrelson) who releases Hustler (in my opinion the best
porno mag ever, but that's just me) and gets severe backlash from censors,
church people and just people in general.  But, we see his struggle to fight
back at any cost (even his legs) to send a message- just because you don't
like doesn't mean you can't let me publish what I want.  Forman directs this
pumped drama with 5-star performances from Harrelson, Love (as the tragedy
queen girlfriend) and Especially Norton (as the suffering yet compelling
lawyer).  Never ashamed and always On the edge, this film has a place not
only in film history, but in Hustler magazine's also.  The real Flynt
appears as a Cinncinatti judge and Norm MacDonald appears as a reporter. 
A+

THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT (1996) ****  Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love,
Edward Norton, James Carville, James Cromwell, Richard Paul, Crispin Glover,
Vincent Schiavelli, Miles Chapin, Brett Harrelson, Donna Hanover, Norm
MacDonald.  Superb biographical account of smut publisher Larry Flynt
(portrayed by Best Actor nominee Harrelson in arguably the role of his
career) whose bouts with the courts regarding libel, pornography and
ultimately first amendment rights to the freedom of speech are captured like
a tempest in a teacup that depicts the rise and near fall of Flynt (who was
paralyzed in an assassination attempt) and the uncomparable love affair with
his doomed yet dedicated wife, bisexual, drug-addicted and tragically AIDS
afflicted wife Althea Leasure (Love in a toweringly brilliant turn at acting
that deserves all the recognition she mustered) who stood by her man as she
withered away.  Funny, insightful, important and some masterful filmmaking
overall thanks largely to the cleverly constructed screenplay by Scott
Alexander and Larry Karaszewski ("Ed Wood"), costumes by Theodore Pistek and
Arianne Phillips, and all too believeable production design by Patricia von
Brandenstein.  And yes that is real-life Flynt as one of the judges passing
sentence and yes it is real-life brother Brett of Woody playing siblings. 
Kudos to Best Director nominee Milos Forman (who was sorely passed over in
the Best Picture nomination as well as practically getting shut out come to
mention it) for pulling off a difficult hat trick: making scum
respectable.

it is unfortunate that when one thinks of the movie 'people vs. larry
flynt' the first person to come to mind is courtney love. not that she
does an less then stellar job, rather by focusing solely on her, the
rest of the richly deserving cast are overlooked. woody harrelson is
genius as larry flynt. despite my liberal leanings, before seeing this
movie i had made peace with the fact the flynt was a scum, but i would
support him on the basis of free speech. after seeing this movie i was
able to gain insight into the parts of his character which make him
whole person. instead of seeing what Christian-right zealots, or
bleeding heart liberals, tried to force upon me, i saw the entire man
and all he brought with him. granted this was shown primarily thru
scenes written and directed by milos forman, however, it is harrelson
who brings them to life and convinces me of their sincerity.

Larry Flynt is surely a cult figure, he believed in expressing
thoughts, he made America a better place, in a way. Hustler Magazine,
agreed it's damn explicit, but it's sells... and has made Fylnt a
bloody rich man.

While watching 'The People VS Larry Flynt', I was stunned by the way
the biopic has been executed by legendary filmmaker Milo Forman. A
highly-entertaining, highly-intriguing & a highly-gripping film. This
film shows us the rise & rise of Larry Fylnt, the man who believed in
doing what your heart says. An incredible film! 

'The People VS Larry Fylnt' is a film that leaves behind a lot of
questions? Example, Fylnt says that WAR is more homely a talk than
SEX... Now that's something!

SEX is something that everyone wants, but when it's shown on TV or in a
Movie or in a Magazine, everyone seems to be getting uncomfortable?
Fylnt knew what he was doing... and he proved right after all the
Court-Cases, and despite being a paralyzed man. 'The People VS Larry
Fylnt' is a must watch film.... because it shows a man who did what he
had to despite everything that happened to him.

Woody Harrelson's performance as Larry Fylnt is exemplary. Any
compliment won't do justice his portrayal. Courtney Love is fabulous as
Fylnt's lady love. Edward Norton is fantastic as Flynt's lawyer. Larry
Fylnt who makes a brief appearance as a judge, is perfect.

'The People VS Larry Fylnt' cannot be missed by anyone... watch the
amazing life of a man amazing man right now! Two Big Thumbs Up!
