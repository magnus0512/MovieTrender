This movie was blasted by every critic in the media, but I think they
were all way off base. Was there anything plausible about it? No. Was there
anything funny about it? YES! I never got a chance to see it in the theatre,
but when I rented it on VHS, I couldn't stop laughing. Of course, I saw it
alone at the time, so I thought that perhaps there was something wrong with
me. Then my brother rented it, and the rest of my family saw it, and we all
laughed, and I realized something I should've known earlier, that this was
funny, and I shouldn't be ashamed to think that way...and neither should
YOU!

I had never heard of this movie before my 16 year-old son rented the
video.
It is hilarious. Think of "Babe" as produced by the Marx Brothers, using
singing cockroaches instead of mice . Evidently the critics didn't like it
much, and I can see how they might not see it as high art, but as
entertainment and an enjoyable time in fantasy land, it right up there
with
the best of them, in my opinion.

Just remember, this is a critic who holds some of the most vile films ever
(vile in a good way) in my list of best comedies ever (Dumb and Dumber, UHF,
South Park), so it is not surprising that I found this movie enjoyable and
funny.  The movie stars Jerry O'Connell as a loser type who finds an
apartment in NY's east side for 50 or 60 bucks, but then he also finds it is
infested with more cockroaches than the DMV has idiots.  I'm sure there will
be some watching the movie who might think, this might be a good time to
become bulemic, and for those people I don't reccomend the movie for the
hurl factor.  But for those who can take the chum of roaches on a face, in
breasts, in toilets singing songs (I love the funky towel song), this movie
is for you.  By the way, this is the first MTV movie, so it shows that at
first MTV might've had a good streak.  Looks like execs can't take urinal
cake jokes though.  A

What's wrong with you, people??? Why has this movie such a low
rating???

I loved those bugs everywhere. The special effects are OK. The story
itself is a bit naive, but, h√©, it's a fairy-tale!

Everyone who likes Who frames Roger Rabbit, Ant Z, Thumbelina by Don
Bluth (OK, bad example) or over-the-top-sentimental-romance like What
Dreams May Come must like Joe's Apartment.

What do we have here? 1: a lonely country-boy in New York; 2: two ugly
and dumb bad guys; 3: a sweet girl as love interest; and 4: thousands
of bugs who are supposed to be loathsome, but soon turn out to be
adorable. The first three items you have seen all before. But the
fourth! You've never seen something like this, and you will never
forget you saw it.

Ignore the negative rabble expressed above. Rent the movie, and I think
you'll be pleasantly surprised. "Joe's Apartment" has more creativity and
originality in it than most of the films I've seen in 1999. Great concept,
great animation/set designs, great fun.

I've seen this many years ago when it just came out and now decided to
watch it again. I remember it was pretty funny but then I was maybe 7
years old so now I was expecting this film to be stupid. I was
surprised how clever this film was. The humor was sometimes stupid but
in a good way. It also was kinda original humor sometimes. Jerry
O'Connell played a naive new arrival to New York very well. It was so
funny when I first saw his naive physiognomy just before he got robed.
Jerry O'Connell is a really good comical actor. I also liked that
Walter Sh!t character (played by Jim Turner), actually he was the
reason why this comedy appeared original to me. It's also a half
musical so there were few songs performed by Cockroaches, it was pretty
clever made.

I was quite surprised when I saw the mark given by the IMDb users to
this film. Indeed, even though it's not the best movie of the century,
I found it quite entertaining and "fresh".

I loved the way it is shot, there is a real work on the layouts that
makes Joe's apartment look dirty and moving at the same time. Besides,
the visual effects are well done for a film that dates back to 1996.
They are not THAT impressive but they are very efficient to create the
funny atmosphere. I could not describe the way I laughed rolling on the
floor when I saw those roaches watching an "insect porn movie", it
cracked me up.

This movie is worth seeing for sure and does not deserve such a mark.
Everyone who's curious should watch it to make his/her own opinion and
should not pay attention to the five miserable stars given to the film.

I enjoyed this movie despite one thing - I had an irrational phobia of
roaches since I was young, and only got over it a few years ago just before
this movie came out. Just as well - I might never watched it otherwise. To
see the roaches up close and performing song and dance made me a little
nauseous at first as it brought back memories of those times when I got too
close to a real roach, but after a while, you sort of forget that they are
dirty and disgusting pests and actually start enjoying and anticipating
their next comic routine. For me, the stars of the show are the roaches, in
fact, I can't even remember who acted in it after a while.
<|_=00=_|>

This movie is pretty funny. What it lacks in intelligence, it makes up for
in fun.

Joe(O'Connell)has just to New York City and into his first apartment. The
only problem: it's infested with thousands of talking cockroaches. They all
seem to be a pain in Joe's butt, but the roaches come in more useful for him
than he thought.

This movie is no classic, of course I don't think any of MTV's movies will
be considered classics. But they are really funny(also see Beavis and
Butt-Head Do America and Dead Man On Campus).

It's a hilarious and fun little flick, even for people who don't like bugs.
8/10

Decided to pick a film I'd never heard of- this turned out to be very
funny
especially the songs of the cockroaches.  Connolly plays a down on his
luck
character well and the scene at the 911
operations is hilarious-- even my son was laughing along with me. Whoever
designed the set deserves credit for their creativity.. a funny film that
deserved more credit than it got.
