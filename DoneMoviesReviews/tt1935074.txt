There are films that are produced out of the "film structure", that are
seen by a few lucky pair of eyes, which is regrettable . This is one
such movie. "Alem de Ti" is one of the best films that I've had the
opportunity to see . The fabric that is made of is engaging ans
mesmerizing. Across a story of common mortals, we are presented with a
cruel reality and all the symbolism that flows behind our eyes. The
impact of unemployment and despair in a marriage, how man and woman
react to the disintegration of their lives, the same moments lived so
differently . Simply cruel and memorable. This film also shows the flaw
that exists in Portuguese film structure , when these projects are only
possible to be done independently, either by rules, either by jury of
rejection. However, this film enjoys a freedom that it would not be
possible within a structure. It's an awesome film that shows the
strength of the Portuguese Independent Cinema.
