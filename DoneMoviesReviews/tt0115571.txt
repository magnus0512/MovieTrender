Intriguing sci-fi thriller stars Sheen as a brilliant but paranoid
astronomer whose obsession with his quest to discover intelligent life
puts him at odds with his neglected girlfriend. He discovers a strange
signal from outer space, but is fired when he tries to make it public.
Deciding to take matters into his own hands, he stumbles upon the
existence of aliens that have already invaded the Earth and are using a
sophisticated technological scheme to try and take it over. Brainy
thriller abandons guns, explosions, and car chases in favor of actual
science and clever plotting. Starts off slow, but only gets more and
more interesting as it goes along, with an effectively edgy performance
from Sheen that's right on target. ***

What makes The Arrival so good is that it's paranoia could be real.  Where
as scientists tell us that global warming is the result of smokestacks and
deforestization and factories, this film has other ideas.  And the ones
that
are in here are a little more frightening than what the scientists think.
Think for one second all that has happened over the last decade or so.
Think of all the ecological changes that we are facing right now.  These
crisis are all a result of our greed and our industrializaton, which in a
way can be a euphanism of greed.  And this film takes all that we know
about
ozones and animal extinction and global warming and such and puts its own
little spin on it.  What if a species that is greater than us has looked
at
what we are and decided that we are too stupid to take care of our own
planet so they will take it away from us.  After all, according to the
theories that this movie subscribes to, we are wasting and destroying this
planet anyway, why not speed up the process?

Charlie Sheen stars as an astronomer who thinks he hears a definitive
signal
from outer space.  But when he brings it to his boss he learns that due to
budget cut backs his department is being eliminated.  So his signal theory
falls on deaf ears.  But from here on out the movie becomes almost
Hitchcockian in the way that you have a character that knows something
that
no one will believe, not his superiors, not his girlfriend, not even his
friends.  And so it is up to him to try and find a way to convince
everyone
that he is not crazy and that he is telling the truth.  And what makes
this
film work so well is two things really.  The first being the story that
was
written David Twohy.  He also wrote The Fugitve so we know right away he
is
a good writer.  Here he has some excellent characters and crisp dialogue
for
them to speak.  The script is a real positive here.  But the second thing
about this film that really makes it work is the portrayal that Sheen
gives
of Zane.  Sheen always looks confused and amazed at the same time.  He
can't
believe what it is that he has uncovered and his expressions and his
mannerisms really do his character justice.  I can honestly say that the
last time I saw fear like this from anyone that saw aliens first hand was
in
James Cameron's incredible 1986 film Aliens.  It has taken ten years for
someone else to get an actor to show true fear when it comes to the
subject
of ETs.  Most films have the stars crack clever jokes about the aliens
that
they are meeting for the first time.  They rarely show fear but in The
Arrival, Sheen is always afraid.  He is never shown as anything more than
a
normal human being that has uncovered an ugly truth about the true agenda
of
what the aliens are realy up to.  His performance is one of the best
things
about this film.

The Arrival is intense.  It doesn't stop for a breather too often and it
is
very intelligent.  It has interesting opinions and it also makes you
question our own intentions when it comes to the well being of our planet.
Most people passed this one over when it came out because Independence Day
came out a mere month later, but as good as ID4 was, this is a different
kind of movie.  It is more serious and has an opinion on some very
political
issues.  It never runs out of steam and it is very entertaining.  I highly
recommend that you give it a chance.

The Arrival remains the little seen and little known sci-fi thriller
released the same summer as Independence Day.  Most people opted to watch
the latter film for all its big action scenes, which left The Arrival a
box
office loser, a destination it most definitely did not deserve.  Since
then,
it has gained some life on video and will probably gain more popularity
since the film marks the debut of director David Twohy, who is proving to
be
a force to reckon with in Hollywood, especially after his success with
Pitch
Black.

Zane Ziminski (Charlie Sheen) is a brilliant radio astronomer who, along
with his partner (Richard Schiff), receive a radio signal which Ziminski
believes was emitted from an extraterrestrial source.  But as soon as he
hands the recording over to his boss Phil Gordian (Ron Silver), everything
seems to go wrong.  Zane is fired, his estranged girlfriend Charlotte
(Teri
Polo) is transferred, his partner dies of an apparent suicide, and the
tape
of the recording has seemingly vanished.

Ziminski's new job, as a cable repairman, gives him access to his
neighborhood's attena dishes, which he lines up together into a phased
array
in hopes of receiving the signal again.  To his luck, the signal returns,
but it's coming from a small town called San Marsol in Mexico.  Heading
down
there, he meets a scientist named Ilana Green (Lindsay Crouse), who is
down
there studying the rising temperatures of third-world countries.  As
Ziminski continues his investigation, he believes he may have uncovered a
worldwide alien conspiracy.

What makes The Arrival as great a film as it is is because of the story,
which is smart and interesting.  Rather than giving us mindless action
scenes, writer/director Twohy prefers to keep our attention with an
intelligent story.  Despite this being his first time behind the camera,
he
proves himself an adroit filmmaker, weaving the story together
brilliantly,
and unfolding little plot surprises along the way.

The Arrival is primarily a thriller, and Twohy is more than competent at
creating action and suspense (witness Pitch Black), both elements of which
are sharply executed in this film.  The final hour of the film is full of
edge-of-the-seat excitement.  Composer Arthur Kempel's score also adds an
extra bit of tension. The film moves at a lightning pace and there's never
a
loss of momentum or a lag in the running time, which runs smoothly
throughout all 115 minutes.

The cast is also strong, with Charlie Sheen taking top acting honors.  I'm
a
little suprised of all the statements claiming he was miscast for the
role.
If anything, he's the only person who could play the part, and he comes
through superbly, never failing to convince for a moment.  Teri Polo is
decent as Sheen's girlfriend, and while her character isn't developed as
well, she still makes an impression in her limited screentime.  Ron Silver
is utterly chilling as Ziminski's boss, who wisely underplays the role,
rather than chewing the scenery.

It's truly a breath of fresh air to watch a sci-fi thriller that relies on
logic and plausibility to carry the story.  For viewers who enjoy a fine
story and believable science with their sci-fi, The Arrival is a true must
see.

*** 1/2 out of ****

Writer/director David Twohy accomplished the near-impossible in the
summer
of 1996; he delivered a fun, fast-paced AND intelligent sci-fi thriller
with
The Arrival, an intriguing, thought-provoking film that was unfairly
ignored
in theaters at the time of its release (most viewers chose to see
Twister,
M:I, Independence Day). The movie has a classic premise about a radio
astronomer (Charlie Sheen) who receives a signal from outer space that
may
or may not have come from extraterrestrial life.

To say anymore would be unforgivable, as Twohy packs in believable twists
and turns throughout the plot, which is fun without insulting the brain,
and
complex without ever bogging down in mind-numbing confusion. The script
does
have a few head-scratchers here and there (I was particularly miffed that
Lindsay Crouse's character, an environmentalist, wasn't familiar with the
concept of terraforming) and some contrivances, but they're hardly
bothersome and aren't noticeable until a second viewing.

As good a screenwriter as Twohy is, he's even more adept as a director
(further proven by Pitch Black, a superbly crafted deep-space thriller
with
a script not even half as smart as The Arrival's). With great pacing and
precise editing, Twohy builds momentum with each discovery Sheen unfolds,
until it culminates to an edge-of-the-seat climax that's quite satisfying
(unlike...cough...cough..."V: the Final Battle", Independence Day).

The cast is all-around effective, with Sheen delivering a surprisingly
terrific performance as the paranoid astronomer. It's great to see an
intelligent protagonist who thinks his way out of tight jams, rather than
shooting and blowing up everything in sight. No one else gets half of
Sheen's screentime, but Ron Silver is nicely ambiguous as his boss, and
Teri
Polo, however underused, is fine as Sheen's girlfriend. Lindsay Crouse
also
makes a good impression as an environmentalist studying some strange
activity.

On a technical level, some sci-fi fans might be a little disappointed.
Those
weaned on "V" and ID4 will notice the lack of large-scale special
effects.
Sorry, no disc-shaped motherships here. Still, the visuals present are
mostly decent, certainly passable enough that they don't become a
distraction to the plot. Despite the use of CGI in its more primitive
stages
(this was '96, after all) the effects are still occasionally excellent
and
imaginative, such as the spherical object those tight-lipped men wield.
Composer Arthur Kempel's score adds a bit more tension to the already
excruciating suspense, and evokes a creepy atmosphere during the film's
quieter moments.

Remember, folks, The Arrival is a rarity, a once in a while example of
how
pure movie magic can be created when we've got dedicated filmmakers who
want
to intrigue the audience rather than catering to demographics just for
the
sake of box office returns. Forget Independence Day, The War of the
Worlds,
or V and its sequel, The Arrival is the most satisfying cinematic
depiction
of alien invasion to date.

I had the pleasure of watching this film in the theater and to be quite
honest that is the way it should be seen.  Its a well done movie about
aliens visiting earth, overall the story is nothing original (but it does
have more then a few tricks up its sleeve) and is your typical Alien
invader
movie.

Watching this on television years later its hard to appreciate just how
well
this film was shot.  One scene in particular involving a large dish and
someone almost falling off the side of it almost caused me to make a mess
in
my pants when first watching the film on the big screen.

When I saw it the theater was mostly empty (not good for the movie, but it
probably allowed us to enjoy it some more) and it was its first run (did
it
have a second?).  Its sad the film didn't do as well as it should have, at
the time it was the best alien related movie in theaters (I seem to
remember
independence day being out at the same time).

My one gripe is a somewhat weak ending (especially considering the
strength
of the rest of the movie).  Overall it is an entertaining and somewhat
thought provoking film that you won't regret watching unless you don't
like
movies that emphasize suspense instead of action.  And there is a LOT of
suspense in this film.  It doesn't skimp on action either but it saves it
for the end of the movie where it belongs and makes some
sense.

Some people may not like its message either but I didn't have a problem
with
it and it certainly didn't get overly preachy.  People voice their
opinions
on screen just as someone would do in real life, and I don't have a
problem
with that.  The real focus of the movie is aliens, not the environment.
If
you fixate on the environmental message in the movie then you probably
have
some issues or just don't get this type of movie.  Global warming is more
of
a subplot that leads Mr Sheen in a certain direction and nothing
more.

The special effects are fairly spartan but effective and nicely creepy
when
they are used.

Some of the characters are kind of annoying but are necessary, and don't
detract from the film overall.

A worthwhile rental, especially if you have a large TV to watch it
on.
<|_=00=_|>
At least "The Arrival" doesn't fall into the car chases and gratuitous
explosions category of sci-fi. It has some semblance of scientific
reason, and some pretty original ideas. The vortex balls were an
intriguing touch, and the gigantic satellite dish scenes quite
effective. It is necessary to suspend disbelief on several occasions,
but overall the film succeeds as entertainment. Having the kid along
seemed like kind of a stretch as well. If you can look past the faults
in logic, "The Arrival" is totally acceptable. If you are going to tear
it apart for every little thing, then I suggest you look elsewhere. -
MERK
<|_=00=_|>
This aliens vs. earth film succeeded because it added humor to the
suspense story and Charlie Sheen did a great job adding to that with an
expression-filled face that made he and this film fun to watch.

Story-wise, most of it made no sense as Sheen got out of one impossible
scrap after another but good sci-fi special effects and suspense helped
make the story interesting and fast-moving. You get caught up in the
story and don't care if their are plenty of holes in it. It's also
pretty tame, language-wise. Lindsay Crouse provides the female interest
and Ron Silver the villain, a familiar role for him.

The film was popular enough to make a sequel, but that horrible. Don't
waste your time on that one.

When the astronomer Zane Ziminski (Charlie Sheen) receives signal from
a distant star, he reports and gives all the evidences to his chief,
Phil Gordian (Ron Silver), and is immediately fired. Zane becomes
obsessed to locate the signals again and finds a transmission to the
outer space in the same wave from Mexico, and he flies to the place.
Meanwhile, the scientist Ilana Green (Lindsay Crouse) is investigating
the unexplained raise of the temperature in Third World countries and
also goes to Mexico for further research. They meet each other in a
small Mexican town, where Zane finds that aliens are preparing to
annihilate the human race and preparing Earth for their occupation.

"The Arrival" has a good story that uses the abnormal raise of
temperature and change in the climate on Earth as part of a plot of
invasion of our planet by aliens. Director David Twohy follows the same
style of John Carpenter in this movie. However, there are two problems:
the first one is the permanent lunatic expression of Charlie Sheen, who
also keeps insane attitudes along the whole story, giving a total lack
of credibility to his character. The second one is probably the budget,
or a badly developed screenplay, with flaws along the narrative.
Anyway, this good sci-fi film entertains and has a good ecological
message in the end, particularly the quote: "If you can't tend to your
own planet, you don't deserve to live here". My vote is seven.

Title (Brazil): "A Invasão" ("The Invasion")

note: On 23 August 2016, I saw this film again.
<|_=00=_|>
I was a little bit late getting to the theater to see The Arrival. The
movie was slated to start ten minutes past the hour and I didn't arrive
there until five after. Then I had to go through the concession stand
crowd. When I finally reached the theater -- the large screen was
engrossed by a huge satellite disk and there was some guy talking.
"Damn," I thought. "I just missed the start of the movie." It wasn't
three seconds after that realization that I had another one. "This
isn't the movie. It's a commercial." A commercial which it turned out
for one of the large multi-billion dollar phone companies. Talk about
false scares.

Some people have called 'The Arrival' a thinking man's science fiction
movie. While the jury is still out on that, I will say it's not stupid
either. It is however one more of those 'one man saves the world'
flicks. Which are never terribly realistic, but on their own terms,
entertain. Charlie Sheen plays Zane Zaminski. A smart, but soon-to-be
paranoid astrophysicist who has the slithery Godian (Ron Silver) for a
boss. One day watching the satellites some anomaly passes his screen.
Suddenly the search is on. What was it? WHO was it? Not letting the
subject go gets him fired from his job and deeper and deeper he
journeys into the paranoia.

The Arrival is one part use your mind, two parts conspiracy theory. As
Zane takes it upon himself to get to the bottom of things and find out
who's involved and to what lengths they'll go to suppress everything.
Soon we start to see elements straight out of the X Files. Aliens...
conspiracy... colonization. The story has it's own set of
implausibilities, but things move at such a pace that there isn't much
time to question them. Zane knows something is going on and the deeper
he digs the more we find out. It's all about the ride. Could one man
really stop such things from happening? Probably not, but that doesn't
stop 'The Arrival' from being a fun time.
<|_=00=_|>
Charlie Sheen plays Zane, a radio astronomer who accidentally discovers
an alien signal from space, that also has origins on Earth. When he
tries to tell his boss(Ron Silver, very good) he downplays and denies
the importance of the find. Zane then finds out he has been fired, and
the tape he gave to his boss disappears, so now very suspicious, he
undertakes his own investigation, which leads him to an alarming truth
about aliens who are indeed very much among us...

Well written and directed by David Twohy, this science fiction film is
a pleasant surprise, and Charlie Sheen is appealing and believable as
the man determined to find the truth, and warn the world; sounds like a
certain FBI agent from "The X-Files"...
