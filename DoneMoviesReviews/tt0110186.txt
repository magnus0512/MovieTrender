Boy meets girl.  There are a mountain of movies that attempt to tell a
love
story and disappoint and fall flat.  JASON'S LYRIC is... unforgettable --
a
love movie to enjoy many times.

The greatest strength to this love story is the same as the key strength
in
the world-wide hit LONG VACATION tv series exported from Japan: as the
story
unfolds the viewer deeply and personally cares about the boy and the girl.
The characters become real and we feel as they feel.  Intense.
Unforgettable.

Highly recommended, but keep in mind that there is grit, drugs and
depictions of violence in this movie.

It isn't often that you get to see a compelling film that deals with human
sacrifices, love and the courage to find a true identity to lead a good
moral life. . .

Jason's Lyric was one film that became that testament of many issues
combined. For me it's not just a film but more in terms of reaching out to
those unfortunate souls living a somber life and helping to reflect on those
wishing to make a change for the best.

Allan Payne, Jada Pinkett and Bokeem Woodbine all give electrifying
performances. One of the strongest issues the film dealt with was Payne's
relationship as a brother to troubled Woodbine. The disturbing part for me
though was Forest Whittaker's performance as the father who go's berserk
after the Vietnam War, losing all sense of morality for himself and his
family.

A brilliant film, I can't recommend this film enough.

One endeavor in filmmaking that quite frequently doesn't turn out well is
mixing genres. "Jason's Lyric" combines crime drama, love story, and ghetto
film-and does it surprisingly beautifully. The acting is remarkable, the
script is remarkable, and the emotion is remarkable. This movie could have
turned out very pretentious and very cheesy. Apparently, the directors,
writers, and producers completely acknowledged this, and refused to let that
happen. The characters are very well developed and, while the movie doesn't
justify Josh's actions, it does convey compassion for him. It also provides
new insight on what it's really like to live in a ghetto. If you can find
this movie (after all, I saw it on Showtime and haven't the video in any
stores) totally see it!!!!

Jason's Lyric is a truly great love story with a superb cast.  The
performances by Bokeem Woodbine as Josh, and Forest Whitaker as MadDog are
strong and convincing.  Complemented by a superb soundtrack, this movie
should not be missed.  Jason's Lyric should have received more theatrical
exposure letting the main actors and supporting cast shine.

All of the characters had a back history.    I could see the cause and
effect (why the characters were the way they were) in the film.  The
actors
were believable.  Each time I watch it (at least twice a week), I see
something new.  "Jason's Lyric" has inspired me to get on the bus and stop
watching it go past.  The symbolism in the movie was refreshing.  The
cinematography was excellent as well, every part of the film enhanced the
whole. "Jason" gave me hope that a man can commit in a relationship; he
just
has to want to do it.  He made me dream again of lovely words and warm
embraces.  "Lyric" assured me that closing up was not the answer but
trying
to love again is the way to get the magic back....

I was very surprised at how good this movie was. My rottweiler, Lyric,
who is now 13 years old was in this movie when she was 7 weeks old. I
named her Lyric after the role of Jada Pinkett. Lyric went on to be an
American/Canadian Champion. Her show name is Am/Ca CH. Von Traeger's
Lyric. The movie took place in the 3rd Ward in Houston, Texas. It was
awesome being on the set during the filming of this movie. I am looking
at showing Lyric at the "Reliant Center World Dog Show" in Houston this
next Month. She will be shown in Veterens Class 12 years and older.
This is a rottweiler specialty show. Thank you for letting me share.

Jason's Lyric is clearly one of the best urban love stories ever put on
film. The direction by Doug McHerny showed real talent as did his
screenpaly. Allen Payne and Jada Pinkett both showed early lead acting
roles
in this good film. Finally I think Forrest Whitaker and Bokeem Woodbine
both
deserved Oscar nods for their work. I give it **** out of
****.

This film pretty much came out at a time when more and more films featuring
blacks in positive images were coming out. This film came out around the
same time as another film that Jada Pinkett was in, The Inkwell. However,
this film tries to be three films at once. First its a story about the
tragic events in the brother's past. The second story is almost an urban
version of "Romeo and Juliet". The third plot revolves around how Jason's
brother constantly gets into trouble leading to his tragic end. The love
story would have been enough for me because it shows that African Americans
can have very loving relationships and can be romantic. Unfortunately, in
the end it turns into a typical bloody shootout, but it does have a twist
ending and that helped to save it.

Jason's Lyric wasn't a great film theatrically, as it had small
promotions. Judging by the title and cast, i didn't expect a good film.
It was actually a great film with powerful performances. It tells the
story of Two brothers (One good and One Bad) living with their mother
in a rough area. Jason played by Allen Payne is sensible and taking
care of his younger brother Joshu. Joshua played by Bokeem Woodbine is
a little crazy and has a violent side to his personality. Its a half
love story and half action movie thats worth the watch. Allen Payne
delivers a good performance. Bokeem Woodbine is terrific, see him in
Dead Presidents also. Jada Pinkett looks ultra sexy and plays the love
life of Jason. There are some fabulous Sex scenes, Jada looks
fantastic. Overall, Good realistic storyline and deserves a chance.

Jasons Lyric did have its moments. I saw what they were going after,
but it's as if they had the map, but no treasure. Needless sex scenes
seem to combine one after the other ( including a graphic scene where
they make love outside, leaves get stuck to his butt...oh, heavens, why
am I watching this.) It misses a few key points, but all in all, it is
a tender story that goes off track with needless violence and use of
drugs. Not for all, but was watchable.
