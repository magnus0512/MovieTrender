Firstly, if I see another review labelling Ghosts of Mars, Vampires or
Escape from L.A 'Carpenter attempting to have another hit movie' my
head will explode like Snake Plissken's would have done. Hello people:
CARPENTER HAS NEVER HAD A HIT MOVIE! Besides maybe Halloween, Starman,
Christine and Escape from New York to a lesser extent, Carpenter has
made bomb after bomb. Certainly the films that have the biggest
following today; The Thing, Big Trouble in Little China, They Live,
they all were torn apart on release. So, surprise surprise everyone
hates Ghost of Mars like they did The Thing. Now, I am in no way
comparing Ghosts to The Thing, which is an vastly superior film. But
Ghosts is in the same position; as it will be in fifteen years time
when people will look back on it and say 'Maybe it wasn't that bad.'
WHICH IT ISN'T. What elements in this film aren't Carpenter? The
western atmosphere? The focus on action and story, and not character?
Vast hoards of nameless enemies? These were all in Assault on Precinct
13. Oh wait, no one liked that in 1976 because they were so brain dead
they had to wait for a cult following to develop before they gave it a
second chance. So it must be the structure. Is the structure, with it's
flashbacks-within-flashbacks and weird editing any more bizarre than
the corkscrew science behind 'Prince of Darkness'? Oh that's right,
everyone hated that in 1987. So I'm looking for the faults. That's it,
the action isn't very good. Oh damn, it wasn't very good in 'Big
Trouble in Little China' either. Wait, didn't it take people fifteen
years to 'get' that film as well? Maybe it's the fact that it has Ice
Cube in the lead. Yeah, Carpenter defiantly shouldn't have let a
non-actor take the leadoh wait, Roddy Piper! If 'They Live' was made
in 2001 that would be bashed for having an non-actor carrying it, but
for some reason because it was made in 1988 (blasted on release) Roddy
Piper's performance is the stuff of cult legend.

All said and complained about, if Ghosts of Mars was released in 1987
or something it wouldn't be getting bashed now. Hell, Jason Statham
might have been the new Kurt Russell. There's plenty of fun to be had
here, and Carpenter certainly hasn't 'lost his vision' as a lot of the
so-called fans who are stuck somewhere around 1982 claim. If anything,
with Ghosts of Mars and it's OTT structure, Carpenter is developing on
it.

Maybe it's just me, but I can't understand how someone can hate Ghost
of Mars and have unconditional love for Assault on Precinct 13. Give
Ghosts another go, and watch it with an open mind. If you can't at
least do that, you are not a fan of John Carpenter.

Carpenter's films tend to age like fine wine.  When they're released,
they're lamblasted by critics and fans.  Ten years later, they're
classics;
for instance, "The Thing", "Big Trouble in Little China", "They Live",
"Prince of Darkness" -- and "Ghost of Mars" is no exception.  This is a
tremendously entertaining film that shouldn't be viewed as a horror film,
but rather, as a tongue-in-cheek western, in the vain of the Spaghetti
Westerns.  You all have to pull your heads out and watch this film
again...in about nine years.  I'll bet you'll say, "You know what, that
was
a hell of a lot of fun."  In the meantime, get off Carpenter's
ass.
<|_=00=_|>

John Carpenter, together with Brian De Palma, are the only active directors
who had created a body of work consisting of the representation of a
particular, personal world, forged by the mixture of a number of themes and
subjects, reinserted on tracks left by classic directors (Hawks and
Hitchcock respectively). They make one single movie over and over again,
reaching outstanding levels of accomplishment in style and
coherence.

Thus `Ghost of Mars' is full of Carpenter's imaginary. The plot, the
characters, the tone, everything can be linked to his previous work, most
notably `Assault on Precint 13', that was yet a reworking of Hawks' `Rio
Bravo'. And that's a significant point regarding this film: despite the
zombies, the gore, the futuristic set-up, the red Martian atmosphere, the
heavy metal score, `Ghost of Mars' is essentially a western in the most
classic way. There is a train, a lawman (played by an actress), a group of
deputies, a gang of bandits, a frontier town surrounded by the
desert.

As in Hawks, the individuals work as a group, defined by codes of
professional skill in a strictly masculine environment. Interestingly,
Capenter portrays the Martian society as a matriarchy, but the elements
operate the same way: the good guy and the bad guy differentiate from each
other just for the fact that they are in opposite sides of the law, but are
nevertheless exchangeable. Also, following Hawks' epic, the vulnerability of
the hero is determined by a fault or weakness (Melanie's addiction to drugs
is a progression of Dean Martin's alcoholism in Rio Bravo).

Told in a peculiar series of flashbacks from different points of view, and
as in `Vampires', with the use of long, continual dissolves, the story
introduces some original points, like the ghosts taking possession of human
through the ears and Desolation's smart device to save Melanie with the aid
of drugs. There are some plot holes, yes, some bad acting and gratuitous
-though stylized- violence. But it's Carpenter unpretentious as ever,
telling us how dark our future appears, not from a pulpit but from his
director's chair. And I'm very grateful for his effort.


<|_=00=_|>

I'm not some naive fan who thinks Carpenter can do no wrong.  I didn't care
much for Vampires or Village of the Damned (they were alright, but the
scripts for those two were not up to snuff for a great director like
Carpenter).  However, I think Ghosts of Mars is one of his greatest movies. 
If you can't appreciate this movie then you can't really appreciate
Carpenter, IMO.  From the Lovecraftian story and atmosphere, to the
anamorphic photography, to the excellent music, everything here is
Carpenter.  Hopefully this movie will find its audience, in time, rather
than be forgotten.  One criticism of Carpenter I've never been able to
understand is that people say he isn't subtle, he relies solely on shocks
and violence.  Yes, his movies have shocks and violence, they are the
release mechanisms for all of the terror he slowly builds up, neanderthals! 
It seems some film critics are just too good for American horror, they can't
stoop to its level from their lofty perch.
<|_=00=_|>

Mars has fascinated humans for years.  It's the closest planet to us, and
the only one that comes close in terms of livability.  Its forbidding
landscape and dire red color scheme are magnetic (at least in movies; I
can't tell you how disappointed I was when that little NASA toy-car thing
sent back pictures and Mars looks like Utah.  No red sky,
even.)

But Mars has a curse.  You just can't make a decent movie about it.  Think
about all the Mars movies in history (...Attacks!, Mission to..., Red
Planet, Angry and otherwise, Santa Claus vs. the Martians, etc.), none of
which have been able to rise above the "not bad, not great" category, if
even that.  The lone exception to the Mars Curse is "Total Recall", which
is
a fine film, but it can be persuasively argued that it never actually takes
place on Mars at all.

Throw "John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars" on the "not bad" pile.  Many have
argued that it's not really a Mars movie, but a Western with a weird
setting, which is indirectly true.  It's mostly a re-working of Carpenter's
classic "Assault on Precinct 13", which was, itself, based on "Rio Bravo".
(I wonder when John Carpenter is just going to give in and make a bonafide
Western.  You can tell he totally wants to.)

While I'm on the subject, can someone tell me why John Carpenter seems bent
on titling all his recent movies with "John Carpenter's", as if we'll
forget?  It implies, oddly enough, that he didn't actually direct it, the
way "Ian Fleming's James Bond" books were published long after Fleming was,
technically, dead.

Anyway, the plot involves a squad from the Martian Police Force doing a
prisoner transfer from a mining colony.  Mars, it seems, is run by the
"Matronage", a kind of Lillith-Fair dictatorship, which is a neat twist and
gives some original zip to the movie.  The transfer is quickly forgotten,
as
some sort of primal ghostly force is possessing the locals and turning them
into a blood-crazed cabal of body-pierced mutilation enthusiasts (the movie
often resembles a Slipknot video run amok).  The throngs are led by a
bulked-up Maximum Leader who looks like Marilyn Manson's steroid-pumped
older brother.  The cops and criminals join forces with the contents of the
Hollywood Gun Shop, and mow down the screaming hordes in an effort to
escape.  One wonders why Merchant-Ivory didn't pick up this
project.

The intriguing setting, the impressive visuals, and some creepy early
scenes
build up a lot of audience goodwill, which the film then chips away at
relentlessly, as if willing itself to mediocrity.  The narrative is clumsy,

with way too much reliance on flashback.  The story itself is primarily
told
in flashback, which is understandable even if it does reveal too much about
what's about to happen.  But do we really need flashbacks within the movie
to show us things we've already seen?  There are also too many pointless
camera tricks, such as time-lapse dissolves in scenes that don't merit
them.
The characters are needlessly stupid, especially the cops; they too often
resort to using their guns in baseball-bat fashion, when they still have
plenty of ammunition.

The cast, unfortunately, is not up to the task of raising the movie above
the bar.  Natasha Henstridge, whose onomastically-pleasing name is
inevitably abbreviated in movie criticism as "that chick from 'Species'",
is
wooden and uncompelling as the pill-popping police lieutenant.  She is
standing in in the role for an injured Courtney Love, who would have been
more effective, if less pleasant to look at.  Clea Duvall is wasted as a
spaced-out and mostly useless rookie; she seems about as comfortable with a
Beretta in each hand as Quaker Grace Kelly in "High Noon".  But Duvall is
at
least more memorable than that other rookie, whatsisname.  Pam Grier puts
in
a good-sport appearance as the commander, but her scenes are brief.  And
there is the obligatory Smart Person Who Explains It All, whose line
deliveries and pseudo-science are such that you will wish the others would
feed her to the Manson family outside.

The only standouts in the cast are Jason Statham as the weary (but horny)
sergeant, easily the most tactically compentent of the MPF contingent, and
Ice Cube as the prisoner whose transfer is in such turmoil.  Mr. Cube's
unfocused, pinch-faced rage and dumbfounded bravado are pitch-perfect, and
he has all the funniest lines.  (Ironic that in a movie about a
distaff-dominated society, the best performances are by
men).

"Ghosts of Mars" will not rank among John Carpenter's best work (and here I
am specifically thinking of "Big Trouble in Little China"), but despite its
deficiencies I enjoyed it.  Carpenter still has it, and when he's good,
he's
very good.  Desperate-survival-against-the-murderous-armies has a primal
power as a story archetype, and there's plenty of gun-blazing,
head-bashing,
flying-buzzsaw-dismemberment fun to be had by all.  The music's pretty
good,
too.  And there's something about Henstridge and Duvall in black leather
SWAT uniforms that just pushes a button somewhere.  Maybe it's just
me.

If you fight, you can enjoy this movie in spite of its efforts to the
contrary, but you will be a little battle-weary by the time the credits
roll.  Not everyone will be inclined to put forth the effort.  But hey, can
you really hate a movie whose villain is billed as "Big Daddy
Mars"?
<|_=00=_|>
A team of future cops take a bullet train to a Marsian colony to
retrieve a murderer played by Ice Cube. Upon arrival they're attacked
by colonists possessed by the Ghosts of Mars. John Carpenter's
penultimate theatrical feature to date is easily one of his best,
considering the odds against it. The film borrows from Total Recall,
The Thing and Assault on Precinct 13, but still looks fresh and
original. The pace is steady and the mood consistent. The
electronic/metal score recorded by Carpenter and Anthrax, while being
uncharacteristically modern, still is very much signature Carpenter.
The glorious Panavision cinematography is fresh just like it was in the
80s. The (then) young stars Natasha Henstridge, Ice Cube, Jason Statham
and Clea DuVall fit their roles perfectly, most notably Henstridge, who
effortlessly portrays a woman in command and *not* a tough chick with a
chip on her shoulder. The seasoned actresses Pam Grier and Joanna
Cassidy add a punch here and there. Ghosts of Mars leans closer to
Escape from LA on the fun meter, but retains the quality and edginess
of The Thing. A good movie.
<|_=00=_|>
It's funny how people try to intellectualize this movie; they
scrutinise the details (they don't like the shape of that gun, they
don't like this actor's attitude, blah blah...) They should try and
stick to the Star Wars universe, or to base-ball, or even their car's
performances. No matter how classy the car is, dudes, it's the fun of
the ride that matters! I mean, why try to make sense over this :
"vampires on mars" (for ***'s sake!) Carpenter always make sure the
tension, the pulse of his movie and its soundtrack (he's always doing
the same) are just right. No computer-assisted, gratuitous flashy
effects will ever be at the center of one's attention while watching
his "oeuvre". I feel good after seeing them, because I get what I paid
for : good IL' entertainment.

Carpenter is a craftman. He knows what he's doing and he's good at it.
If he'd make chairs, you could still sit on them in the next century.
And that's why people will keep on watching his movies over and over
again, like I do. Plus, his are "B" movies. A B-movie : a movie with a
trashy look, that doesn't long to please, sets itself apart, criticize
society by reflecting our fears, has an punky-ish attitude. You get a
hero that takes drugs not to become a zombie! (Groooooovy! open you
mind! This is the sixties again!) You get a feeling of despair,
everything is narrated as a flashback, so that we know from the
beginning who's gonna live and who's gonna die.

(SPOILER : Everything is solved by destruction.)Remember 'They Live',
Snake Plisken... ANARCHY!!!! We know who the real zombies are since
Romero. You see, it's all about the heart, feelings... After years of
Star Wars re-hash, can you still feel something?

*** MUST READ BEFORE PAYING REAL MONEY ***
John Carpenter was once a really good filmmaker, well at least a good
director. Just think of the 1982 classic "The Thing", which is simply
excellent. He didn't write that movie, but the cinematography is very good.
Unfortunately he DID write "John Carpenter's Vampires" a few years back,
and it sucked. It sucked bad. He also wrote "Ghosts of Mars" (referred to
as
GOM from now on), which sucks even more. I'm a fan of horror, sci-fi,
monster movies and dramas.

This movie is none of the above, but it tries to be a horror movie against
a
sci-fi setting. It's quite tragic because all it becomes is a lame monster
movie on Mars. Or wait... this movie is actually just a western in
space...with monsters.

SO WHAT'S BAD ABOUT IT?
Well, lots of things. To begin with the movie is set in the year 2176 or
something. About 170 years from now.
One of the first things one notices is the fashion of 2176. Remember "Star
Trek" the original series with Kirk? Everything looked like a space-up:ed
1970s, right? Same here, but late 90s. What about technology then?
Embaressing. Almost nothing has improved. Many things are ridiculous to be
set 170 years from now. Sure, it's the early colonisation of Mars and tech
isn't really high in the colonies. But some of the things you'll see are
just silly.

What about guns? There are alot of guns in the movie, seing how it's a
western and all. Well for starters how do Berettas and SPAS-12s sound? No?
Don't have a place in 2176? That's right, they won't have a role at all,
they'll be 200 year old antiquities. There's also an automatic rifle, which
I've forgotten the name of. I think it's a FN model, about 10 years old.
What is it doing there? Oh well, in the absolute ending sequence a pair of

SMGs appear that are unidentifiable, as they're tailor-made for the movie
(finally). But I must say they're some of the shiniest guns I've ever seen.
The design is bad, I'll accept that. But why are they so shiny?
Ridiculous.

***WARNING "SPOILER" BELOW***

The opening scene of GOM is a really bad attempt at copying the Ripley
investigations scenes from the all-time brilliant movie "Aliens". Natasha
is
being questioned about the recent events on Mars, where she starts
recanting
the movie. So after about 4 minutes into the movie, we already know that
she's the only survivor. Great...nice spoiler. So the whole "who's gonna
make it" is off, now what? That is often the only thing movies like GOM and
"Pitch Black" have going for them, But GOM gives it away in the opening
sequence. Very poor.

What also bothers me are flashback scenes that aren't called for. When a
person starts to explain something, we are taken back to a scene we've seen
and are shown it again, just to know what the conversation refers to. It
seems John Carpenter must've known we'd be sleeping ourselves through this
movie.

Again the western style is apparent, the law enforcers (read Sheriff and
his
deputies) have shotguns and the sheriff has a long coat typical of western
movies. There's an old style iron bar jail, the railroad (Mars express or
whatever) and a bunch of outlaws (the ghosts).

So what about the bad guys in the movie? I almost s**t a brick when I saw
them. They suck bad. They are simple miners than have been possessed by the
ghosts and suddenly start piercing and painting and sickly decorating
themselves. It's explained as something the ghosts used to do when they
were
alive....*sigh*....

Oh well, they have this leader guy and he looks like a devil or something,
in the gothiest outfit I've ever seen in a sci-fi. It's leather, it's
black,
it has rings and stuff, bla, bla. The funniest part is when this guy issues
commands or preaches to his flock. It's like he only can say one word and
that word is something like "waah" or perhaps "raah". And he wants to say
these complicated sentences of about 8-14 words each. But all that comes
out
is "waah, waah, raah, raah, waah, waah, raah, waaaaaah". I almost swallowed
my icecream scoop when I first heard him, then I just laughed myself into a
coma. And he's REALLY p***ed all through the movie. He's supposed to be mad
because invaders (the humans) have set foot on his planet. But I'd say his
rage is so immense that he's got a personal issue of some kind. He's just
sooo mad. Maybe it's because he can't say any other words than "waah" and
"raah". I know that would p**s me off.

The religious manner in which his subordinates worship him, with this whole
"primitive caveman meets Jehova's witness bent on Nazi occultism" style is
pathetic.

THE ACTORS
Natasha Henstridge (ze girrrl from Schpecies) can do better, she's no
actress, nor a model, but even she can do better. Ice Cube actually isn't
all that bad, he proved that in "Boyz 'n' the Hood" among other films, this
must be the worst performance from him that I've ever seen, much due to the
script.

This movie so badly wants to be a good SCI-FI, but it can't be that,
because
it so badly wants to be a good WESTERN, but it can't be that, because it so
badly wants to be a good MONSTER MOVIE, but it can't because the script and
props suck.

OK, what about budget? Well "John Carpenter" is a name that should allow
for
some money to pour in. Hm...but not if the sponsors saw "John Carpenter's
Vampires". I believe most of the money went into making the train that
traffics Mars. The design is bad, humans would never build anything like
that train. It looks OK though, in being actually there I mean. It's
OK...nothing more. Explosions are plentiful (the ghosts have dynamite) and
bad. Everyone's on a springboard and fly in a predictable trajectory in
order to not hurt themselves. Typical "A-Team" action complete with tons of
clichés and lame Wesley Snipes-like comments.

Do I sound a tad irritated? That is because I payed good money to view this
movie. I feel people have the right to know what to expect as I have the
right to be upset about what I saw. This review contains no profanity so
there should be no reason to not post it.

Overall : I gave it a 1 in my vote. When disc 1 had finished I had to think
for approx 10 seconds if I wanted to load disc 2. Or as my Japanese female
friend would say : "Sucky-sucky".

Yeah Ghosts of Mars! Liked the movie a lot.Liked the soundtrack, the
heavy angst ridden sounds fit real well with the surreal psychedelic
imagery and well accent the bleak horror of being in a situation where
the force to fight against is super horrific and unseen.There is
nowhere to go and no way to survive except to fight in an all out only
the strong and fast can survive,shoot,splatter,and chop mode.This is
reminiscent of the bleak and inescapable horror of John Carpenters
masterful remake of "the Thing".It put me in the space of hopelessness
and despairing odds.A tailor-made"B" movie of excellence.This movie
reminded me of one of my favorite authors of science fiction and
horror,Mick Farren.Specifically his book "Mars-The Red Planet".The
storyline and imagery are similar.If you liked "Ghosts",then you might
want to check out this Del Ray book,out of print but available in used
condition. Anyways Kudo's to Carpenters Ghost's of Mars
<|_=00=_|>
Sometimes you want a deep film, sometimes you want escapism and a few
shocks and thrills. Ghosts of Mars fits the bill perfectly. It is a
very easy film to get into. The tension is palpable as along with the
characters you see things rapidly going downhill on this mars colony
but don't know exactly why, what is doing this. This leaves ones
imagination to fill in the blanks, all you know is that crazyness is
everywhere. The sense of dread and tension in the film is palpable as
you feel the Ghosts of Mars closing in on the heroes. The film moves
along at a good pace and when things finally reach their boiling point
the movie delivers the goods in an all out action tour de force.

And to boot the ending delivers an interesting twist.

Who could ask more from a sci-fi film? Interesting premise, tense
fast-paced story, great action.

Some sci-fi films try for hyperealism, some suck you into their world
and then have some fun with a wink and a nod. This is that film, and
frankly thats the only reason I can see that some people don't like it.
