If you're not Australian you may find this movie a little strange, but
extremely funny. It is great Australian humour set on a socially inept
man, Malcolm (Colin Friels), and his love of trams. To make some extra
cash Malcolm has some live in tenants who to say the least are very
different to him.

As a Melburnian it was a pleasure to watch the trams, an icon of the
city throughout this movie, and the familiar city scapes. This however
was not the reason "Malcolm" was so good. 

The acting in this film is spot on and the script and writing is
wonderfully imaginative and original. If you like Australian comedy's
rent it. If you've never seen an Australian comedy give it a go, if for
nothing else but the superb soundtrack.

I was very happy to find this awesome film on DVD for $10 yesterday. I
hadn't seen it for ages but I knew that buying it would result in many
happy viewings in the future. My first viewing reinforced my view that
this film is just as terrific and engaging as I saw it when I was a
young fella. The whole gadgetry was what I loved back then. Now I still
love the gadgets but the whole story makes it a terrific viewing
experience.

The three main performances from the film are all unreal. Colin Friels
is so great as the awkward and brilliant Malcolm, John Hargraves is
super as the dodgy but good hearted crim and Lindy Davies is wonderful
as Judith. She is sexy and straightforward in a really honest way that
is rarely captured in any film (kinda reminds me of Rachel Griffiths). 

Big plaudits have to go to the writing/producing/directing team of
David Parker and Nadia Tass. The info contained on the DVD explains to
us that the Malcolm character was based on Tass's brother John who was,
like Malcolm, socially inept but had formidable intelligence and
talent. The final character is so likable. The fact that they put the
whole thing together speaks very highly of them as a film-making team
(another terrific film they did was "The Big Steal"). 

They did a great job on the special effects too. Low budget but iconic
really. The car, tram, rubbish bins (!) are brilliant. The film's
opening with the tram also highlights the very special score of the
film. Watching Malcolm cruise around Melbourne in his homemade tram
with the music in the background is a really lovely way to open the
movie. 

It's been years since there has been a funny, innovative, big-hearted
Australian film like this (or The Big Steal). Hopefully someone out
there can match it.

This is an absolute gem - a really original, clever and funny film.
Colin Friels and John Hargreaves are brilliant, the gadgets are
hilarious, and the music (from the Penguin Caf√© Orchestra)
beautifully surreal.
This film has without question the most unusual bank raid
sequence on film.  Enjoy!

I love this film,if not for the sheer inventiveness.The locations are
great
as are the characters,i.e the key role of Malcolm,played with sheer
professionalism by Colin Freils.The funniest moments I think,revolve
around
Malcolm`s gadgets.Malcolm himself is possibly autistic,as I can`t remember
if it`s said in the film,but as we know,autistic people make up for their
lack of social skills admirably and in Malcolm`s case,his gift is in all
things mechanical.The scene that make me burst out laughing the most was
the
actual robbery where normal everyday bins are used for a purpose their
designers could`nt have thought of in a million years!! Also the music
used
by the Penguin Cafe Orchestra is a work of art,as it appears to be tailor
made as the scene ends up looking like a ballet,when the music pauses so
does the action.My hat is doffed to the creators of such a heartwarming
film,and seeing as Australian humour is very much on a par with British
humour,I had no trouble "getting it".
Overall,a fantastic film that should be shown every Christmas,as further
generation will enjoy it aswell for years to come.I know I
will

This is my favourite movie. There have probably been a thousand bank
robbing
movies made but none of them as inventive as this. It is cleverly thought
out with some great bits of humour and also a car that divides into
halves.

10 out of 10.

A brilliant low budget off beat Australian comedy that is well worth
tracking down. Easy to watch and light hearted. It is rare that I go
out of my way to recommend a film but this one is worth it. It contains
one of the most amusing bank robberies portrayed in a film. The getaway
sequence has to be seen to be believed. The soundtrack is provided by
The Penguin Cafe Orchestra. Watch it if you can. A friend managed to
catch it on TV many years ago and taped it and it is almost worn out. I
have been trying to get a proper copy since then but have failed
miserably. I have had to hide it to prevent anyone borrowing it again.
One of these days it might be worth going to Australia just to track
down a copy ( well, almost!)

I had almost forgotten about this movie until I happened upon it while on
here. I discovered this movie on TV one night and loved this cute little
film. Very funny, charming, creative, touching, great storyline and good
acting all around. Unfortunately it appears that it didn't get the publicity
and release that it deserved. As others have already said on here, find it
if you can, because it is well worth it!!

Malcolm is one of several movies produced by David Parker & Nadia Tass. It
won 8 A.F.I. (Australian Film Industry) awards when first
produced.

Malcolm was one of my favourite movies while growing up, particularly
because of my own love of tinkering and model railroads. It and Rikky &
Pete
are still two of my favourite movies, light heared Australian comedies
that
didn't shy away from anything, which is the depressing reality of more and
more modern movies.

As it goes it actually has a few stars cast (local stars though not
international) in it.

While somewhat simple (in the story this is blamed at least partially on
his
upbringing by his mother in what is an ethnic neighbourhood) Malcolm has a
flair for invention which gets him fired from his job with the Melbourne
tram company after he builds a working tram out of spare parts. After
being
laid off he is told he needs to get a boarder in to support himself
financially. Enter Frank an ex-con still upto criminal activities who
brings
in his girlfriend Judith to live in the other room.

It is a good fun family movie which most if not all will enjoy, provided
the
Australian style of comedy and pacing don't get to you (this is typical of
Tass & Parker who tend to put a very Australian feel to all the movies
they
produced together which means the pace is laid back, the language a touch
vulgar, and the whole affair is a realistic depiction of human beings [the
car that split in half was actually built it's not just a
prop]).
<|_=00=_|>

I have to say it is a good few years since I saw this film, but it has a
place in my heart. As a shy person in my teenage years, I had a small
affinity with Malcolm. He was so shy that he crossed the road near the
beginning to avoid some kids. Not your average film lead.
Some of the gadgets and vehicles were clever, and well implemented into
the
film.
This film could not work anywhere else in the world. The sense of humour
is
typically Australian, and definitely adds to the film. If you ever get the
chance to catch this film, do so.
The music by the Penguin Cafe Orchestra also gives the film something
extra.

Last time I saw this film I was 8 or 9. Mum had to change the channel when
the sex scenes came on.  After watching it again there wasn't really any
sex
scenes.....booooo.
I got it so my boyfriend (from Glasgow) could watch a great Aussie film,
and
we could look out for bits of Melbourne.  He thought it was great.  I have
to say the second time round was even better and it was good to know they
lived in Collingwood, although I am not sure if Napoleon Street
exists.
