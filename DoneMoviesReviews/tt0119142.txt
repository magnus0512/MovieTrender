This is a gentle and amusing comedy.  It is the story of a (very) rich
couple on the point of divorce forced to flee from the IRS.  They end up in
Amish country and pretend' to be from another Amish community.
The main comedy is from how they try to adapt to the new life, whilst
keeping up the pretence of being Amish, and is quite remarkable in
portraying the Amish way of life sympathetically.  Even the Amish accent is
a little more accurate than is normal in a comedy (having lived there
myself).
It is understandable why it was not a great hit in the Cinema, as it has no
big blockbuster special effects, but for the TV it is just what is required
when a good laugh is required  and the language is suitable for all
(except
for possibly an Amish viewer).

This movie may not be Academy Award material, but I found it very
entertaining.  The performances by Kirstie Alley and Tim Allen are
hilarious.  There's also a "moral to the story."  I've seen "For Richer or
Poorer" several times and highly recommend it.

They are absolutely hilarious!
I thought this movie was funny. The story wasn't bad either. It's a regular
"Good" comedy movie. The CIAs were hilarious too. Well, the fashion show
stuff was pretty dumb, but it seemed neccessary for the movie. If you like
comedy movies, watch this flick. I don't think you'll hate
it.

I saw this movie originally in NYC (Times Square) after I couldn't get
seats to the Broadway show I wanted to see. After watching this movie,
I was glad I missed the play. I laughed so hard, I was afraid I was
going to be asked to leave the theater. I am a resident of Pennsylvania
and have spent lots of time in Amish country. Their life style makes me
hunger for the simple life, the peace and tranquility of sensible
living. I have watched this movie about 25 times and I still look
forward to seeing it again. Some thought should be given to a sequel
perhaps. In these times of turmoil and discontent, maybe this
blue-print for the simpler life should be considered. Incidentally, I
know that Maryland locations were used as Pennsylvania stand-ins, but
that okay. The scenery was almost as beautiful as ours.

granted this is not high brow sophisticated comedy, but it was actually
a really fun movie! Kirstie Alley was not her usual annoying self, and
it was enjoyable to watch her character change due to the Amish
influence. Tim Allen was more relaxed and less of a ham, so his
character was fun to watch. the Newman mailman guy from the Seinfeld
show always cracks me up. the Amish child was cute too.

the Amish were not disrespected, and this movie made me want to learn
more about the Amish. just a quick and simple Google search for Amish
brought up several good sites. perhaps this is the real success of this
movie - that viewers hear the message of simplicity and virtue in
living one's life, then take the next step to learn more about the
Amish culture and beliefs, and finally take to heart these life lessons
we learned as a child.

I don't know why, but I have loved this movie from the moment I first
watched it.  It isn't even that funny, there's just something really cute
about it.  It's very fun.

This is a fine film about a pair of city folks trying to blend in with the
Amish.  Although my favorite movie about Amish life is Witness(1985) this
movie does a good job showing you what life is like in Amish country.  The
plot was fine, the acting was great and funny, and the outline of the
movie
was creative.  All in all: I give it a 10 out of 10, only because I love
comedy movies.

This movie strikes me as the reverse of Tim Allen's Home Improvement.
There, Tim's the over the top ham and his sidekick Al is the tempering
force trying to contain him. Here, the Amish do the job and they are
the greater force that really tone him down while still giving him
plenty of opportunities to be funny. The theme of materialism getting
into the way of relationships is needed in 2006 even more than in 1997
when this movie was released. It would be well for everyone to re-watch
it now to realize that materialism has gotten totally out of control in
today's world. Another thing that makes this movie enjoyable is that it
isn't frantic like most comedies are. Too many try to emulate the Marx
Brothers. In the frantic lives we do lead today to sustain our
materialism, it is nice to have something slower paced yet still not
bore you to death.

I am not a lover of comedies, however this is one of those
exceptions.

What can I say? The title says it all. Tim Allen is brilliant (as usual),
and Kirstie Alley is great as his support. The movie does not knock the
Amish people too much, and the movie ends with everyone living happily ever
after - even 'Big John'.

I thought the deleted scenes/bloopers i the closing credits was a great
idea
too.

This is a nice fun movie that I really enjoyed. OK, its not great art, but
it serves very well as entertainment. I thought it was not insulting to
Amish or their way of life, it was very amusing to see how caught up we
sometimes allow ourselves to get in things that in the long run don't
really
matter. I like how the characters interacted with one another. This is
light
humor with a little depth, its not slapstick. If you enjoy being amused,
without having to "LAUGH OUT LOUD", you will probably enjoy this
film.
