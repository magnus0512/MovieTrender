I loved T.P from the first time I saw the preview. I went to see it
with my friends and we were just dazzled by the brilliance of the
story. (sorry about my cruddy spelling)I instantly took a liking to
young Jim Hawkins and the charming John Silver, and fell in love with
the wonderful animation. It's been three years since the movie came
out, and I'm still crazy about it. I've watched it over 300 times. It
is truly wonderful and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes real honest
to god animated movies. 

About the Disney's biggest flop thing, chill out people. That's no
reason not to watch the movie. It's simply a mater of opinion. If you
don't like the outer space theme, or whatever, then don't watch it.
Just don't go around discrediting it....There are fans of the movie out
there, lots of them, so just CHILL! 

Hope I was at least a little helpful! -Blackbird

Everyone show watch and buy this movie if for no other reason than to
support Roy Disney against Michael Eisner!!

This poor movie suffered from political mudslinging between these two.
As "Treasure Island" was one of the Disney company's first and most
successful live-action pictures, Roy had always been passionate about
making an animated version. Eisner, ever Roy's opponent, was in charge
of the advertising budget. So, when Treasure planet was released,
without any typically "Disney" fanfare, it met with unsurprisingly
small attendance.

The day after it was released, Eisner held a press conference,
declaring "Treasure Planet" a flop, and blaming it for Disney's poor
3rd quarter performance. Roy promptly quit the company his uncle and
father had built.

As far as the movie itself goes, the controversy robbed what I think is
the finest example of a "Disney" movie since Mulan. The animation is
spectacular, the vocal talents are superb, and Brian Murray is one of
the greatest Long John Silvers I've ever heard.

But beyond the technical qualities, "Treasure Planet" captures the
spirit of Disney much better than recent Disney debacles (see Valiant,
Chicken Little, Home on the Range). I think the end product came out
very nicely, and, larger than that, I think Walt would have been proud
to put his name on this one.

Robert Louis Stephenson's `Treasure Island' has always been one of my
favorite classic stories.  The tale of a teenage boy thrust into the
adventure of a lifetime features pirates, swordfights, an ocean voyage,
betrayals, and buried treasure among many other classic adventure-story
ingredients Â– what's not to love?

It's been filmed countless times before, in many various incarnations,
including one with the Muppets and an animated version starring the Monkees'
Davy Jones; so what new way can be thought up to retell this
hundred-year-old story for twenty-first century audiences?

Set it in space, of course;  a brilliant idea that pays off
handsomely.

To be fair, TREASURE PLANET is not the first film to set the story among the
stars; that distinction belongs to the 1987 Italian live-action TV
Mini-series TREASURE ISLAND IN OUTER SPACE. But that version has scarcely
been seen outside of Europe, and I seriously doubt that it could hold a
candle to the stunning visuals seen here.

And the key word here is VISUALS.  This is arguably the most visually
stunning animated film to come out of the powerhouse Disney animation
factory, EVER.  The canvas on which they paint here is wide and broad, and
full of breathtaking color and beauty.  Pirate ships with solar sails soar
across a canopy of stars, and behemoths that look like whales trumpet along
beside them.  Alien beings both friendly and fierce populate the universe,
and futuristic machinery stands side-by-side with nineteenth century
technology.  I've never seen anything quite like it.

Oh, and there is a story here as well; amazingly, it is quite faithful to
the source material in both outline and details, only deviating from the
text where necessary to transplant the action from the oceans of nineteenth
century Earth to the planets and solar systems of the future.

It centers around Jim Hawkins, a fatherless boy constantly getting into
trouble with the law for his rambunctious, extreme-sports ways, who gets the
chance to prove himself when a dying pirate leaves him a treasure map with
his dying breath.  In short order he finds himself cabin boy on a stargoing
vessel bound for the legendary Treasure of a Thousand Worlds; along the way
path is blocked by pirates and collapsing stars and other perils of
interstellar travel.

If I have any complaint at all with the film it would be that it sticks a
little TOO close to the novel, some of the nineteenth century ideals just
don't ring true in the futuristic setting; but that's easily forgivable
compared to the wondrous images this magic film offers.

Let's put it this way, with no fan-girlish outbursts (Which is pretty
hard). This movie has pretty much everything required of a superb
movie.

As is the case of most Disney movies, there is a light-hearted side and
a serious side, but this movie is slightly more serious (my
preference). This movie has so much heart and a lovable cast of
characters. I don't think it was completely for teenage boys, it just
centered around one with a situation that is sadly familiar with many
of us.

The atmosphere is such an imaginative one, who cares if you can't
breathe in the vacuum of space? (The book from Disney explains that
this is a kind of parallel universe.)Nebulae, galaxies, comets...they
all are stunning with these 18th century ships. I personally think that
most spaceships look rather alienating.

The soundtrack may be drowned out at moments, but the times you hear
it, it fits well. The song by The Goo Goo dolls' lead singer is perfect
for Jim, and the sequence in the movie is more worth watching than the
music video! And the story! I think the depth, connections and growth
of the characters are certainly levels above Treasure Island, thanks to
the Disney touch. (I really don't want to spoil anything.)Just buy it,
if you haven't over the last three years.

This movie, even though given a bad rap by the critics, happens to be
one of the best movies in the world. If you have not seen it, step away
from your computer and rush out to get it. I don't wanna see you till
you have that movie. Got it? Good now watch it. This movie's amazing
graphics, twisting and riveting storyline, although based on the book
Treasure Island it has many changes, including story changes,
characters, and its planets not islands. Its amazing even though made
by Disney anyone from age 10-100 can love this movie! The final sense
with Silver and Hawkins is amazing and yet, in a way a bit sad. (That
might have been a spoiler thats why I checked Spoiler) I also Loved the
Music, it was amazing. The greatness in the whole film was flawless.
The song "I'm still here" by the goo goo dolls was spectacular. I could
not find anything about this whole film that did not make me smile,
with the voices fitting the characters perfectly, and the amzaing
graphics! This was a amazing film by Disney. It would make Robert Louis
Stevenson proud, especially for the name of the ship the RLS Legicy; or
the Robert Louis Stevenson Legicy. You could really feel Jims struggle,
and Silver's emotions. I could not find one flaw with this movie! I
gave it a 11 out of 10.

Upfront, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie beyond what I thought I would
take from it. Being an animation major I can thoroughly pick apart most
movies, especially what Disney puts out now-a-days. Unfortunately for
their movie Treasure Planet, either it was ahead of itself ambitiously,
or it was rumors that spread like wildfire (when it was being released)
that killed it. Actually, that's why I didn't see this film until very
recently, because of everyone's (and mine at the time) prejudice
against Disney features springing up amongst way too many viewers, and
especially for this film. I believed them that this film was terrible,
and subsequently never got to see it until a week ago. Man, everyone
was wrong.

I'll be honest, and give it its weak points: The main character (Jim)
is quite blank and not very well developed. Which is bad because an
audience cannot connect to a flat, central character. Secondly, the CG
(although very well stylized) I think didn't mesh as well with the 2D
animation as it should have. Other than that...you might pick apart a
few other things about the movie (and no, the dialouge isn't that bad.
it's a G rated movie...it's not supposed to be incredibly complex).

Treasure Planet keeps pretty tight in line with the original classic,
"Treasure Island", even when softening it down for a younger audience.
I grew up with that story, and had no problem with the adaptation in
Planet. Also, this film contains two masterfully animated characters,
John Silver and Dr. Dilbert Doppler (animated by two masters, Glen
Keane and Sergio Pablos, respectively). If you're an animation
enthusiast, these two are gold to watch (especially the pencil tests in
the special features on the DVD).

This whole review is a little long-winded, but in closing, this movie
is more than what was said of it. If anything dealt the killing blow in
this movie failing at the box office, it was everyone's bad word for
it. Not true. Please see for yourself!

Cast yer sails matey...we be blastin outta these worlds! It was all
good: cast,script, music, and the effects animation was the BEST! So
why the rate of 8 then, well I really didn't like B.E.N.'s personality,
but I'm sure others out there will love him. There are plenty of funny
moments, endearing moments (without being sappy), and just the right
touch of suspense to keep you hanging on. I was so glad the romance was
played down for once, along with those endless Disney love songs. The
one scene in the movie that is accompanied by song is such a score!
Completes the scene of who Jim is and how he feels with just that one
song. Bravo Johnny Rzeznik! I plan to go out and buy this DVD. I only
wish I could have a Morphy on my computer to play with; Disney missed
the boat big time on that gold.

Treasure Planet is the adaptation of the classic swashbuckling
children's tale of Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. R.L.S
originally wrote Treasure Island chapter by chapter for his son, as a
bed time story for each night. When the story was first published it
was actually condemned by some! Claiming that such violent tales
encouraged boys to become ner-do-well's such as the pirates it
glorifies! Suffice to say, Disney's futuristic adaptation fails to
capture the rebellious nature of the original Treasure Island. Fans and
fanatics can gripe all they want if a scene is missing from the book,
or if a character's been changed, but as long as the core meaning of
the story remains, it's essence. Then adaptation has been successful.
Treasure Planet does not capture the essence of the book entirely, in
fact it lacks a lot of it's power due mainly to the protagonist. Jim
Hawkins of Treasure Planet does not suffer as much as his archaic
counterpart, therefore his character does not under go the same heroic
journey and does not emerge as profoundly changed as R.L.S original
did.

Aside from that, Treasure Planet makes for a fine adventure film for
the whole family. There are moments of joy and pathos to be found
throughout. And it is interesting to see a science fiction twist on a
pirating classic.

When this film first came out, I was quite a bit skeptical, given what
I thought was another lame Disney storyline like Atlantis, Emperor's
New Groove and Mulan, and opted out of seeing it in theaters. Now 3
years later I was curious to see what it was all about, so I gave it a
chance and rented it. To my surprise, I was blown away by the brilliant
animation and complex storyline (going beyond the book), and wondered
how this film could have been so overlooked. The coming of age story
about a teenage boy deals with real issues in today's world, and how
each of us has our own potential to reach. I also loved the score and
the music by John Rzeznik. The only complaints I have is that Jim looks
much older than his supposed age (15), perhaps 17 or so, and that the
robot was obnoxious and shouldn't have been added in at the end. All in
all, I'd have to put this on my list of favorite Disney films since The
Lion King and Pocahontas.

I saw this in theaters back in Late 2002.

Treasure Planet is inspired by the famous book, Treasure Island. Only
this version is taken place in another universe where ships sail in
space and Aliens and Human live in the same community.

Jim Hawkin a guy who's about 17, lives with his mom who works at their
Inn which is their home. Jim never got to spend much time with his dad
since his dad came and go due to whatever job he's in. Jim hasn't made
his mom proud for him, specially when he keeps trespassing factories on
his Sail Board and getting caught by the police. His mom doesn't want
to see her own son sent away to a juvenile hall.

Life seems bad for Jim, till one day a pirate came out of nowhere
telling Jim to take an object that a crew of pirates are after. The orb
Jim got is a map that shows you the location of Treasure Planet. A tale
Jim heard from as a kid is no longer a bedtime story to him. It actual
exists and he's determine to go there and be sure he'll make his mom
proud for him.

I don't care if many people disliked this movie. But I really enjoyed
it. Even if it's one of the PG rated Animated Disney movies.

The CGI and 2-D animation combined together makes it very visual. It's
rated PG only for Action violence, and a few non important characters
die. It also has a would be villain and an actual villain in it too.

I recommend it to those who like sci-Fi animated films or those who are
into the unique Disney movies. It's something the whole family can
enjoy together.
