This is by far best movie I've seen made in Russia in the last 5 years.
I was not crazy about the title and synopsis, but decided to see it
anyway. It was not an easy to watch film, however its extremely
talented and good looking cast, tough topic, great cinematography, and
many other aspects, including an unflinching depiction of the state of
the affairs in Russia make it a great movie. I think it's director will
have huge carrier. 

Using a story of young successful DJ in provincial Russian town, film
shows slow descent into abyss started by one wrong choice. There is no
way out and every choice after that is worse than the other.

I could not help but draw parallels to another movie I just saw -
Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.

But if Before the Devil is looking at the family story, Vise is showing
the whole country that you can either leave or stay and keep making bad
choices and get dirty and struggle to stay alive. 

The plot will keep you absorbed and even though I would of edited about
20 minutes out of it (I might be wrong about it).

I strongly recommend this film, if not for underlying idea, then for
the very good thriller that it is.
