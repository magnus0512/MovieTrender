I find it interesting that people can get so many different feelings and
experiences from one movie, but then; this is exactly the type of movie
that
would cause such disparity. The question really is, are you watching the
movie for entertainment, or to critique it?  There are wondrous scenes of
erotic intimacy here (unfortunately not as fully developed as they could
be)
- and glimpses into just what two people "in lust" will allow themselves to
be led into...  The sensuousness of the relationship is the key - not the
believability of the surroundings or the rest of the 'plot'. Is it
believable?  It certainly is conceivable... Liz (Kim Basinger) studying
slides at work, so distracted by her thoughts of intimacy with a man she
hardly knows that she can't keep her hands off herself... John so taken
with
her that he will spend exorbitantly for a gift - to give a woman he doesn't
know - but feels that he must meet. The passion and need for these two
lonely people that lets them open doors to their inner selves and allow
another in BEFORE thinking of the consequences (there are ALWAYS
consequences, in film and life; for opening "those" doors). Is it
believable
that they would win the fight with the street thugs? No. Is it believable
that the adrenaline rush, the release of the flight impulse and fear, the
closeness found in 'defeating a common enemy'; could possibly lead to the
intensity of sexual closeness and climax in a semi-secluded spot (under
falling water at that)? Yes. Are the other scenes believable? It's
entertainment, not a psychology class... They are conceivable, certainly.
Ever been really mad at your partner, and that anger leads to words then
breaking dishes then apologies then hugging then closeness then sex? How
about anger leading directly to sex? It can happen, and it does. It is not
so much a rape as it is a purging of desire. The scene with Liz
blindfolded,
and the whore coming in to the room - you share the tenseness Liz feels.
Will she be stimulated? Of course. Will she let John know it turns her on?
He already knows it does. He wants HER to know that he knows it will.

This movie is a glimpse of what manipulators people are. The efforts made
to
manipulate another person into 'making them want what you
want'.
So much so, that it becomes their desire, not yours. So much so that the
desire is to see if you can manipulate the other becomes more consuming
than
the original goal. Seeing if she WILL crawl across the floor becomes more
important than seeing her actually doing so. And her feeling the depth of
her self in what she will do - and finding she is doing it because SHE
wants
to, not because he wants it. Liz takes her pleasure from John, too.  What
appears to be a "rape in progress" as John pushes Liz back on the table,
ends with her crying because she was excited enough by it to climax. That
is
perhaps the 'real' rape; her discovery that even if she is initially
violated, in her mind she realizes it arouses her enough to let it
continue;
and as it continues she finds herself clutching at her 'attacker'; and
attaining orgasm. The rape as much of her mind as it is her body. It is her
discovery of what she learns of herself. When she finally leaves the
relationship, he finds he can't live without her. Who manipulated who?

This movie, dated as it is, is still fresh because it is enough like life
to
be real. No, we may not be that rich or that attractive or that selfish or
that spoiled. But we also may wish at times that we were...

Two successful, but lonely yuppies embark on a sexual odessey for 9 and a
1/2 weeks. All people seem to talk about when it comes to this movie is
about the sex scenes and the nudity in the film. This film is not about
sex
and nudity in my opinion. It is about control and power. I found this film
to be intelligent and stylishly done and yes very erotic. Rourke and
Basinger make a steamy couple and the ending and the events that unfolded
in
the film lingered with me long afterwards and left me thinking for a
while.
This is one film that actually seems to have gotten better with
time.
<|_=00=_|>
Probably one of the most misunderstood movies ever made, Nine and 1/2
Weeks to me is, in one word, amazing. 

Some call it soft-core porn while others call it meaningless. I call it
a movie that shows the viewer what other movies do not show. The other
side of relationships. The darker side, the side of people that most
movies don't go to because they believe the average person would be
turned off due to the fact that it is not the average love story. 

Yes, parts of the movie to some might seem slow, but if you let
yourself get involved in the character, then you might just understand
what this amazing movie is all about.
<|_=00=_|>

Don't know why I didn't see this movie until recently, as I am a big
Adrian Lyne fan. Maybe because Mickey Rourke has become so repulsive in
recent years. However, I found this to be a thoroughly entertaining
film, with fascinating performances and all the 80's accoutrements -
music, fashion, set decoration, etc. I don't know how anyone could call
it boring, but we all see different things when we watch a movie.

I thought the much-vaunted "sex" scenes were pretty tame, actually, but
really, really fun to watch! Kim Basinger never looked more beautiful,
and Rourke looked great, too. I disagree that there was no character
development. I think there were depths to both characters that didn't
come out until the end of the movie, which I found very poignant. Yes,
I think it was more about power than sex, and when the moment of truth
came for the balance of power to shift - as the Rourke character had
planned for it to do - he had scared off his true love. Sad, and a true
sequel could have been fun.

I give it 8/10 and plan to add it to my video collection ASAP.

Except perhaps in Paris where, until recently, it played in a cinema just
off the Champs Elysee.  This film has been condemned from just about every
possible, so I will not try and defend it blow by blow.  There is much to
appreciate here, particularly when the film is looked at in the context of
it being the '80's "Last Tango In Paris" - perhaps even self consciously
so.
The opening shot of "Nine 1/2 Weeks" echoes the famous opening of "Last
Tango In Paris" and there are many parallels, but never to the point of it
becoming overt.

If one accepts that form is to mirror content and apply that here it
becomes
clear that efforts were made to do so.  The visual 'look' of both films
not
only mirror their content (for 'Tango': a muted color pallette, yet
somehow
lush, there is a layer over everything) but also their era.  Both films
deal
with similar subject matter, in the context of the time in which they were
made.

"Nine 1/2 Weeks" IS the '80's in much the way that "Last Tango..." is the
'70's - the obsessions of an era are embodied in the struggle of two human
bodies.  Motions, touches are imbued with something beyond what is
happening
in the here and now.  Very much in question here is the internal landscape
of the characters involved - something one, as a filmmaker, would rather
expose in a visual way as opposed to having characters pontificate about
it
(though Brando TALKS in "Last Tango..." it is very often what he doesn't
say, the silence between two lines of dialogue, that SAY more) - in "Nine
1/2 Weeks" there are many visual cues/pointers as to the characters'
states
of mind, i.e. their apartments, the manner in which they are decorated
stark, all straight lines (John) vs. cluttered and dusty (Liz).  Elements
like that make a film work.

The only moments of relief that Liz experiences in the film are when she
is
away from the city, away from John, amidst nature with the painter - in
fact, one almost never sees John outside, just like Paul in "Last
Tango..."
- all these little cues about character should raise the questions in the
viewer's mind - what sort of person would?...

   ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***
This movie is known for its sex scenes, but it is much more than that.
This
movie is also known for the man exploiting the woman, but it is much more
than that.

The sex scenes are just a manifestation of what John (Mickey Rourke)
believes to be the "right" way to have sex.  When Elizabeth (Kim
Bassinger)
comes along for the ride, she is doing just that.  She is coming along for
a
ride.  Her life is so boring that her meeting with john is just the
excitement she needs to get out of her quite boring and predictable rut.
Sure, John's idea of having sex can be seen as exploitation, but
Elizabeth,
until the end, is pretty gung ho about the whole thing.  But, as Elizabeth
is in it for "the ride", John, who is pretty used to "the ride" already,
is
in it to know Elizabeth.  Not Elizabeth's background or where she's from,
but ELIZABETH HERSELF.

This is a well-made film because of its subtlety.  The viewer isn't quite
sure what to think of John until the very end (if they pay close
attention).
The best scene that sums up John's and Elizabeth's relationship is the
scene where they are standing in the rain, John is under an umbrella and
Elizabeth is wearing a hat.  She's playful and being herself, whereas John
is serious and watching her.  She's riding, while John is trying to get to
know HER.  The very last scene of the movie when Elizabeth leaves and
closes
the door behind her, and John hopes with all his heart that she will come
back is telling.  The person who is hurt by the end of the relationship is
the one who was in it for love--John.
<|_=00=_|>
What one realizes while watching this is how limited and ultimately
unsatisfactory is a relationship based purely on sex.

I imagine that the familiar dominance/submissive psychology at the
heart of this visually stunning movie--and it really is beautifully
shot--comes from the novel by Elizabeth MacNeil. I say that, not having
read the novel, because the seduction of Manhattan art dealer Elizabeth
(Kim Basinger) by the smooth and supremely confident financier John
(Mickey Rourke) is so very well done with the expensive presents, the
well-timed flower deliveries, little endearments, etc., that it amounts
to a woman's fantasy. The partial debasement of Elizabeth and her
eventual triumph over her darker instincts and her realization that
there is a difference between love and submission is also something
that one might expect to find in a woman's point-of-view novel.

However when we get to the actual sexuality and how it is acted out, it
is unclear who dreamed up the scenes, MacNeil or director Adrian Lyne
or the scriptwriters. I say this because the scenes were so predictable
and so ordinary, and when not ordinary and predictable, were bordering
on the just plain dumb. Making love in the rain, at the top of a tall
building (inside the clock tower), blindfolding the woman, making her
crawl, feeding her strawberries, etc., bring nothing new to eroticism.
And the scene requiring some imagination--baiting the gay bashers--was
not realistically done. Why directors insist on allowing a man holding
onto the hand of woman to outrun the men chasing them never ceases to
amaze me. And then to have Elizabeth and John stop in the middle of the
street to allow the bashers they have outrun to catch up was just plain
stupid, not to mention the phony fight that followed.

Not only were the sexual scenes predictable but clearly Lyne was in
harness (and I am glad of that) since he stops well short of what might
happen if this sort of theme were fully played out.

Putting all that aside what makes this movie worth seeing is Kim
Basinger. She is absolutely stunning, and it is clear that Lyne and his
camera adored her. More than that Basinger does a fine job of acting in
a demanding role.

I was impressed. Before seeing this film I thought she was a rather
ordinary actress, but her ability to combine grown-up New York chic
with little-girl vulnerability and to make absolutely clear the
psychological dilemma her character's heart faced really held the movie
together.

Lyne's insistence on whispered dialogue difficult to hear was
consistent with the theme of the movie but not kind to these ears. But
that was okay because much of the dialogue was secondary to the visual
exploration of the woman's sexuality. The peek-a-boo and off center and
shadowed shots of Basinger's face and her silhouette, and the studied
smile from Rourke combined with the stark black and whites of their
clothes and the furnishings served to highlight and emphasis the flesh
tones of Basinger's skin while lending an appropriate artistic and
fashionable atmosphere to the movie, which after all has an art dealer
at its center. The many scenes that were began and suggested, and then
cut away from, allowed a richer texture of experience for the viewer
than would have been possible had the scenes been played out. And that
was doubly good because again it is the visuals that make this movie
worth seeing, not the originality of the story and its development.

To those viewers who thought that this was some sort of high class
pornography, I can only say you missed the point entirely, and indeed,
you may be projecting your own sorry mentality. For those others who
were not, shall we say, sufficiently stimulated, I can point you to a
graphic novel with a similar theme (written by a man) entitled The
Story of O which will NOT be coming to a theater near you anytime soon.

See this for Kim Basinger whose sensitive and robust beauty dominated
the screen.

"9 1/2 Weeks", while containing a few sequences of sex and nudity, is
nowhere near as shocking as it might once have been
considered.  Kim Basinger plays Liz, an art gallery employee
who
meets Wall Street trader John, played by Mickey Rourke. 
While
their romance is at first sweet and romantic, things begin
to
quickly change.  John initiate a series of kinky sexual
trysts
involving food, a hooker, and an enticing striptease performed
by Liz.  But the time comes for Liz to question the nature of the
relationship and ask herself, Is this really healthy? 
The
movie is very, very slow, and in parts, very boring.  If your watching this
for the much hyped sex and nudity, don't bother,
besides the occasional glimpse of Basinger's breasts and
butt,
there isn't much here to see.  See it, just don't expect
too
much.

"9 1/2 Weeks" is Unrated for strong sensuality and nudity, and for some
adult language.

NOTE:  "9 1/2 Weeks" is available R-Rated or Unrated, which
is
one minute longer than the R version.  But the Unrated
version
is no more graphic than a regular R-Rated movie.
<|_=00=_|>
I agree with the writer who mentioned that this film is too often
underrated because it deals with a very dark side of sexuality that
many people deny in society and in themselves. The relationship
portrayed in the film is an adult one, and as such it is not a Little
Mary Sunshine portrayal. It is a mature look at sex, not love, and it
never pretends to be a romance. The characters find each other and they
enjoy each other in a way that many people cannot accept, and therein
lies the reality, the truth of this film, as well as the reason that it
is consistently overlooked. For an established actress like Kim
Basinger to accept this role and play it as naturally as she did speaks
to her talent as well at to her willingness to explore alternate
"romantic" ideas on film. Mickey Rouke has always been a maverick force
in film. Look at him in "Diner" and you will see what I mean by that.
He is much more talented than people give him credit for, and younger
filmophiles should discover this early work and try to perceive him as
an actor, not a joke.
<|_=00=_|>

Although generally rubbished by critics because of the two lead actors,
among other things, this was an interesting film in that it attempted to be
artistic, something of a rarity for Hollywood.  Much of what is presented
was designed to look sexy, even if it was unlikely to be if you tried it
yourself. And to give it its due, those responsible for art direction and
cinematography did a pretty good job and it stands repeated viewings to pick
up on nuances missed first time around.  It is tantalizing but not
especially erotic; a lot more is suggested than actually happens.  Anyone
who can remember working in an office in the 80s will relate to the telex
machines, phones with bell-rings, and no desktop computer for the manger,
and no mobile phones.  The 80s apartment decor and fashions will also jog
memories.
