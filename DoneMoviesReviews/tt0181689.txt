I think some people just write reviews for sites like this because they like
to complain. I actually find myself wondering if all the gripers here have
actually seen Minority Report, as I just have, because I have to say that is
one of the most gripping and involving movies I have seen in quite a while.

 The content is amazing - all the little details that put the audience
firmly in the middle of the 21st century. Personally I can absolutely
believe that technology will have advanced in the kind of ways portrayed in
the film within 50 years. Just look back 50 years into the past and you
should be able to see why. The lives of everyday people in the film, where
they are scanned and advertised 'at' all day every day, apart from an excuse
for product placement (and why not?), certainly make you think about a world
where 'they' know your every move (a future towards which we are already
hurtling with some speed).

 The style is amazing - why the wooden balls? Because they're cool is why. I
like to think that as we progress as a civilization we will keep a few such
elegant idiosyncrasies knocking around. The plastic, chrome and glass sets,
objects and architecture all looked clean and functional and the way that
they suck the color out of a scene worked well and gave the film a
distinctive palette. The cars are the best looking vehicles I have ever seen
in a film. I have only one criticism here - why do all the computer displays
look like Macs? Surely a touch unrealistic ;)

 The story is amazing - complicated, yes, but also engrossing, exciting and
scary. There are elements here that are only hinted at, but which give the
plot a depth increasingly lacking in modern action flicks. And it asks the
kind of questions about morality, justice, exploitation and society that'll
keep you thinking for much longer that the film's two and some hours.

 The direction and performances are amazing - the pre-visualization on this
movie must have been a nightmare and yet all the incredible special effects
blend perfectly into a visual style that is completely natural and assured,
as might be expected from Spielberg and Michael Kahn. There are, of course,
numerous references and homages to the work of Stanley Kubrick, which have
given a hint of the edge and flair of 'Clockwork Orange' or '2001'. I hope
it will continue to be a big influence on Spielberg.

 Cruise delivers a first class performance as usual, but the discovery of
this film is Samantha Morton as Agatha. Who saw the film and didn't share
her terror and vulnerability? Little touches such as the way she clings to
Cruise, almost like a baby's reflex, make her a character you immediately
care about, innocent and tragic.

 Anyway, if that's not enough to recommend the film, then you'll probably
never find another one you like again. But if you need another reason, go to
see it just for another fantastic soundtrack from the master, John Williams.

 Full marks, five stars, a must see several times and buy the DVD movie.

I read a lot of previous posts about this movie. This is one of the best
films of the year, and of recent years. This is a perfect blend of action,
suspense, thrills and film-noir. The plot is intelligent and fresh. People
saying it is not original must have slept through the movie. Tom Cruise is
fantastic, Colin Farrell is amazing, as well as Samantha Morton. Spielberg
again proves that he is the master of cinema. A truly great director. I'll
agree, the ending was a little too happy, but not worth complaining about.
This film is not about product placement as previously suggested, it is
simply a entertaining and yet realistic glimpse of what our future may
look
like, as advertising becomes more advanced and intrusive. The film creates
many moral questions and issues, and should leave you thinking. Is being
arrested for doing something you actually havn't commited yet fair? It is
worth seeing again and again. As a film lover and critic, i can say it is
one amazing movie.

Steven Spielberg sets Minority Report in the near future of 2054, in
which the technology is advanced, but not far-fetched. Cars can drive
themselves and ride up elevators, computers come with holograms as a
user interface, and stores recognize you from your eyeball scan. As all
science fiction fans know, however, the genre is not about technology
but about ideas. The big idea for Minority Report is based on a short
story by the venerable Philip K. Dick. In this future, there is a
"pre-crime" unit in the police force, which revolves around three
psychics who are able to see violent crimes before they occur. These
visions are projected in a flat screen panel and manipulated by
detectives with the grace of a symphony conductor. Equipped with
futuristic stun guns, jet packs, and search robots, these cops then
arrest and intern the criminals before the crimes are committed.

We learn all this in the first ten minutes of the movie. After this
introduction, the plot really starts when Detective John Anderton (Tom
Cruise) finds out that the precogs saw him kill someone, someone that
he has never met. He finds himself in a race. With the forced
recruitment of a precog, Agatha (Samantha Morton), he must clear his
name before the predetermined murder. All the while, his old buddies,
now helped with a special agent from the FBI (Colin Farrell), are
trying to track him down.

Spielberg, with Janusz Kaminski, his cinematographer for many films,
have crafted a visually stunning movie. The special effects are
seamlessly incorporated of the world they created. The muted blues echo
the style of black & white film noirs. John Anderton is similar to
noir's morally ambiguous characters--a good cop with an illegal habit
that is forced (by circumstances and desire) to betray the very things
he loves.

But this is not just a special effects or mystery movie. The
characters, all well drawn, are supremely acted by the cast. Tom Cruise
is a good physical actor and he shows it here. By the way he sits or
walks, we can intuit the grief and confusion that's going through him.
Samantha Morton does a good job of portraying a haunted young lady who
has seen too much. Colin Farrell skillfully balances the ambitious and
professional sides of his character. As always, Max von Sydow
authoritatively plays the respected father figure.

This is one of my favorite Science Fiction films. I would also
recommend the following films. These (I think) influenced Minority
Report.

"The Maltese Falcon" ~ film noir "A Clockwork Orange" ~ science fiction
"Blade Runner" ~ science fiction (also based on a Dick story)

***** out of *****

<|_=00=_|>
The future, we are told, are what we make of it. Philip K. Dick did not
want to take that chance, so he wrote many many many short stories
about the future of man and where we, as a society, were headed. Blade
Runner, Total Recall, Paycheck, Screamers, and Minority Report are all
short stories written by Dick about the future that have been turned
into a movie, and most have a less than enthusiastic view of where we
are headed. In Minority Report, we see the effects of predicting the
future to the point of crimes are prevented by arresting murderers
before they kill. If that does not appear logical, there is a quick
little scene early in the movie that addresses those concerns, and on
the surface makes sense. Tom Cruise plays the Washington, DC pre-crime
chief, John Anderton, who runs the investigators who rely on 3
scientifically engineered beings who can see murders before they
happen. The system, of course, raises civil liberty issues, but seems
to work perfectly, that is until Anderton is fingered for a murder. The
rest of the movie, Anderton tries to not only prove that he is
innocent, but also that he was set up, possibly by an oily Department
of Justice figure who is investigating Precrime before it goes national
after an election, played by Colin Farrell. Directed by Steven
Spielberg, Minority Report plays as both a "Whodunnit?" and a
futuristic exercise of science fiction. Much time was spent on
designing the Washington, DC of the 2050s, including cars that run on
magnets, virtual reality stations, and much more throughout the film.
The most interesting design is of the "sick sticks" used by cops to
bring down criminals. The blueish tint given to the film also gives us
a cold feeling, a future that is not as loving or as hospitable as the
time we live in, another trait of a Dick story. A wonderful movie the
works for both the crime buff and the science fiction fan.
<|_=00=_|>

This is spoken in Minority Report by a drug-dealer on the streets with no
eyes at all, so I suppose its free advice for John Anderton, our hero, or a
bit of wise-sounding advice meant to get across to the audience but with no
other good place for it to fit in the film. This is fine with me, too,
because Minority Report is such a taut futuristic thriller that an
incongruous little bit of wisdom like this is not to have any negative
impact on the film as a whole. John Anderton, played with precision by the
great Tom Cruise (oh shut up, the man's awesome), is the chief of the
Pre-Crime department in the District of Columbia, which has successfully
eradicated murder entirely for the last six years. He works with a group of
`pre-cogs' that, together, dream of murders that have not yet taken place
and project enough information for Anderton and his team to watch the video
emanating from their heads to determine where and when the murders are to
take place and to get to those locations and stop the murders from happening
before they happen. 

This is obviously a formula for a highly successful action movie, but the
thing that really makes Minority Report succeed is that it pays so much
amount of attention to things that would occur in this situation in real
life. It is explained very early in the film that the invention of Pre-Crime
has eradicated premeditated murder, as this is most easily detected by the
pre-cogs. The majority of the `business,' then, of the Pre-Crime division in
the District of Columbia, are crimes of passion. This not only provides the
possibility of a lot more tension in that these crimes leave a lot less time
for prevention, but also avoids complicating the plot with the details of
premeditated murders. We don't care about a guy who wronged another guy five
years ago or drug deals gone bad, all we need to hear about are a guy who
comes home to find his wife in bed with another man and loses control.

Given the fact that the movie involves some sort of time-travel (even if
information is the only thing traveling through time), it leaves itself open
to criticism about plot holes. This is obvious, because plot holes like this
even permeated the unparalleled Back to the Future series, which obviously
had plenty of plot holes but handled them spectacularly well. Given the
amount of movies that I have seen that involve time travel, I have come up
with this equation: Time Travel = Plot Holes. This is a universal equation
that is never escaped, but it does not mean that any movie that involves
time travel will be brought down by the subsequent and unavoidable plot
holes. Minority Report did not suffer from its necessary plot holes and
neither did the timeless Back to the Future series (which has FINALLY been
released as a complete set and which no respectable movie collection could
possibly be without). 

My esteemed colleague and close friend Christopher Brown (see his brilliant
reviews at http://us.imdb.com/CommentsAuthor?625436) points out one of these
plot holes in his review of Minority Report, but makes the mistake of
suggesting that, given the nature of the precognition and of the crime
itself, Anderton's murder should never have been predicted since it did not
entail premeditation. Sorry, Chris, but you've missed the boat on this one.
The only thing that this does is bring up the fact that it's impossible to
tell where precognition starts. It could be argued perfectly well that the
pre-cogs played a part in their own precognition. They predicted that
Anderton would commit the murder under the circumstances that he would have
been watching the thoughts of the pre-cogs and seen that he would commit
murder, and then obviously sought to find out for himself how he could have
been expected to commit a murder against a person he has never heard of. In
this case, if he had called in sick that day, all of this would have been
avoided. But he's the best at what he does, he has personal reasons for
wanting to stop murder, he does not slack off, he does not call in sick.
John Anderton was predicted by the pre-cogs to commit murder because he was
at work that day. 

The action in the film comes from the possibility that the whole prediction
of Anderton's murder might be what is called a `minority report,' where the
pre-cogs disagree on something that is going to happen. If he can prove that
only one of the pre-cogs came up with the vision that he was going to commit
a murder, it might cancel out the entire prediction because it is
unreliable. On the way to this goal, we are presented with everything from a
tremendously dedicated investigator (played brilliantly by Colin Farrell) to
some amazingly creepy but strangely accepted identification spiders that
scan John's implanted eye in one of the more uncomfortable scenes in the
film. 

Minority Report is one of the best and most unique thrillers to be released
in years. It is the conglomeration of such a dizzying array of films that it
is difficult to contemplate them all at once. We see elements of action
films, futuristic thrillers, crime films, science fiction, and of course,
the influence of Stanley Kubrick is never far off. There is even, especially
in the later portion of the film, a heavy influence on the soundtrack by
Bernard Herrman, who was the composer for most of Alfred Hitchcock's films,
among many others. It's always nice to see such a respectful homage like
that, and it is only one of the many things that makes Minority Report yet
another addition to Steven Spielberg's extensive list of high-end films (the
last of which was the spectacular A.I.). The only thing I can think of that
holds Minority Report back from joining Spielberg's list of timeless
classics is that it does not have the scope as far as its target audience as
such films as E.T. and Jurassic Park. However, despite not having quite as
large of a target audience, Minority Report stands as a strong entry in
Spielberg's growing list of great films. 
<|_=00=_|>
This gets high marks for being an involving film that, despite a long
length of almost two- and-a-half hours, keeps ones interest all the
way. Being a Stephen Spielberg-directed film, it's no surprise that the
photography is first-rate. This is nice-looking movie. Tom Cruise also
was very good in here, not the obnoxious character he sometimes
portrays (or did more often in his younger days.).

The film is a good mixture of action and suspense. Only the one chase
scene was overdone with Rambo-like mentality of the good guys not
getting hit when they should, and vice- versa.

The subject matter is interesting, too: what would do you (or the
police) had very reliable information on crimes that were about to be
committed, that you could prevent things from happening before they
actually did?

I recognized two people in here who went on shortly thereafter to
become recognizable in TV series: Kathryn Morris ("Cold Case") and Neal
McDonough ("Boomtown"). Add Colin Farrell, Max Von Sydow, Samantha
Morton and you have an interesting cast. I am of the opinion that this
is one of Spielberg's underrated gems.
<|_=00=_|>

May be this film has some flaws but while watching it I wasn't too
distracted by that. Here we have one of the greatest directors alive (Steven
Spielberg), a very big star (Tom Cruise) with a great ensemble (Max von
Sydow, Colin Farrell, Peter Stormare, Samantha Morton, Tim Blake Nelson)
around him, a good cinematography (Janusz Kaminski) and a nice score by John
Williams all packed in a great story (based on the novel by Philip K. Dick)
with perfect visual effects.

In the year 2054 murders can be predicted and stopped before they happen. If
you were about to kill but stopped you are locked. Tom Cruise is one of the
agents who stops those murders. Then he discovers the next murder they have
to stop will be committed by himself.

I will not reveal more of the plot. The story itself is great. It is
intelligent, but also exciting with great action scenes. The visuals are
truly beautiful and perfectly support the sci-fi story. If you like action
thrillers and you don't mind they are set in the future (with some
futuristic gadgets) this is your film. 9/10.
<|_=00=_|>

Steven Spielberg is at his directorial best with this action, adventure.
Tom Cruise is at his acting best as a futuristic cop on the run.  I was
pleased to see one of the best directors team up with one of the best
actors
to make a brilliant movie.

Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, the chief of the Pre-Crime unit of the
Washington D.C. police department.  This unit stops murders before they
happen, with the help of the "Pre-Cogs."  The "Pre-Cogs" are three
psychics
who see the murders before they happen, and Cruise is the one who puts
their
visions together to predict the location, the killer, and the victim of
the
future crime. So far, the "Pre-Cog" division has been successful, with its
six-year span going on with no murder ever happening.  Things get
complicated for the future of Pre-Crime when Detective Danny Witwer,
played
by Colin Farrell, is sent to inspect the operation.  Anderton is
suspicious
of him, because he starts to see cracks in the system.  When Anderton
believes that the cracks are minor, he believes wrong.

Anderton sees another murder happening in the Pre-Cogs' visions and is
shocked to see that he is the man committing the murder.  Now that he is
on
the run from his own men, which of course is under the command of Witwer,
Anderton must unravel the mystery of why he has to murder a man whom he
hasn't even met yet.  As time runs out, Anderton finds clues that there is
a
conspiracy behind it.  Can he figure them out in time, or will Pre-Crime
see
its first murder in six years?

"Minority Report" is a movie with a fantastic storyline, one of the best
I've ever heard of.  The actors are great, the directing is great, of
course, it's Spielberg.  Even the effects are great, they are done with
ILM.
Roger Ebert says that this movie "reminds us why we go to the movies in
the
first place," and I agree with him.
<|_=00=_|>

It's an open secret: the Oscar is jinxed.  Spielberg's triumph with
"Schindler's List" was followed by the longest hiatus of his career, which
was broken with ... "Jurassic Park II", a lifeless sequel of the kind you'd
once have sworn he'd never make - the single worst and most anonymous movie
he's ever directed ("Hook" had its moments).  His next two films were
improvements (there was nowhere to go but up): the first anonymous but not
bad ("Amistad"), the second bad but not anonymous ("Saving Private Ryan"),
but they were both pompous gestures which appear to have been designed to
win still more awards; and it wasn't until eight years after "Schindler's
List" that the skilled director of old times re-appeared (with "A.I." in
2001).

But he's well and truly back now, and I'm happy.  I've even learned to
welcome it when he makes decisions which infuriate me, so long as he makes
them with the right kind of self-assured arrogance.  I didn't like the
voice-over at the end (we didn't need to be told that stuff; we could have
worked it out), or the way he caved in to the modern tendency to be
needlessly revolting (at least he don't play his gross-out moments for cheap
laughs), or even the style of photography (it's easy to manipulate us into
thinking the future is a grim place, if you push-process the film until even
the images which in the normal course of events would be luscious and rich,
are grimy and desaturated - there are other ways of getting colourless
images, as Spielberg well knows, and many of them are better).  Yet, in the
end, big deal.  The story is a knockout, the action is taut, the future
rich, dazzling and believable.  Spielberg is to be particularly
congratulated on how completely he has avoided the unimaginative dystopia of
"Blade Runner".  The future we see here is a MIX of dream and nightmare, so
convincing a mix that we can't always tell them apart.

Here's a measure of how good the movie is: in an interview, Spielberg
revealed that he completely misunderstood the issues which drive the stories
- and there's simply no way of telling this from the finished product. 
Unless Spielberg was just opportunistically latching on to the hook forced
on him by a dim-witted journalist, he THOUGHT the movie was about how much
freedom we are willing to give up in exchange for safety (in order to
prevent terrorist attacks, for instance).  This is interpretation is
strained.  Three people (the precogs) do indeed give up their freedom in
order that millions of other people may be safer, and yes, there is an issue
here.  When one of the Crime Prevention officer says, "It's best not to
think of them as human", I was surprised to find myself nodding in
agreement.  The benefits of the system are so great that OF COURSE I'd
rather not look too closely into the burden that must be borne by three -
just three - individuals.  Aside from the three unfortunate precogs, nobody
is asked to give up any freedom at all.  (Except, of course, the freedom to
commit murder.  But under the law we are already unfree to commit murder,
and a good thing too.)

The interesting issues that DO fall naturally out of the story concern the
futility of revenge.  After people who would otherwise have committed murder
are prevented from doing so, they're sent to prison anyway, presumably on
the grounds that that's what they deserve - and no doubt it IS what they
deserve.  But it's clear enough that locking these people up, however much
it may be in the interests of justice, serves no purpose.  It's exacting
revenge on criminals for the sake of exacting revenge - which is exactly
what the U.S. justice system is committed to doing at the moment, which is
why the future is a realistic one.  (Apart from the precognition, that is.) 
Anderton's mistake is to believe in the value of revenge, and he's never
more admirable than when he realises his mistake.  (THAT was a great scene;
it's a pity I can't tell you exactly why.  Suffice it to say that when we
think we know where the story's going, we may indeed know where the story's
going - but Spielberg is only allowing us to see so much of what's coming up
in order to obscure the rest of it.)

The final sign that Spielberg is again at his peak lies in the performances.
 They're all good.  Tom Cruise's weakness as an actor is that he is only
ever as good as his director, and the fact that he's so good here means that
"Minority Report" was directed by the real Spielberg, the old Spielberg, the
Spielberg with the same ability Charles Dickens had to make even his most
grotesque creations, and even his LEAST grotesque, come to
life.
<|_=00=_|>
Steven Spielberg is a genius. So many great films he has directed. The
Man who created "Jaws" "Saving Private Ryan" and "Schindlers List" is
back for more. In one of his best pictures yet. 

It's 2054. A new method of crime prevention "pre-crime" allows the
police to look into the future and see the horrific results of murder
and rape as they unfold. After a quick introduction to this process,
were straight into the big and bold; main man John Anderton (Tom
Cruise) is accused of a future murder- to a man he's never heard of. So
he's on the run, from a harsh detective (superbly played by Colin
Farrell) as he uncovers some horrible truths and has to go back to the
unwelcoming past. 

Minority report is very good, but also very disturbing- the fact that
this film was a PG-13 or a "12" in England is shocking. Parents, a
note: if your child is under 12 at least I would strongly recommend you
watch this film first. It's dark, compelling, and disturbing-
particularly in a scene where he has to exchange his eyes for
protection... 

This is a fantastic film however that should be viewed and loved by
everyone bold enough to come in its path. Never fail to believe:
Spielberg has come up with yet another masterpiece. 

Overall: ****/ out of ***** (4 and a half out of 5)
