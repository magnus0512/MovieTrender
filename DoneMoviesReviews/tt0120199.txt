Like Stuart Gordon's other venture into science fiction territory, the
underrated and ill-fated ROBOT JOX, this is a nifty little film that
was plagued by production difficulties and failed to find a theatrical
distributor, which is a shame because its quite an enjoyable viewing
experience. Everyone in the cast has fun in this , with Dennis Hopper
delivering some unexpected and funny bits of dialog, Debi Mazar and
Stephen Dorff providing reliable 2nd banana support and Charles Dance
having the time of his life with his horny half-metal madman. This
Excellent DVD offers a chance to see this little sleeper in a great
looking print with a fascinating and funny commentary by the Director.
This film delivers exactly what its titles proclaims.

Space Truckers is too vulgar and raunchy for the art house crowd, too
clever for the great unwashed, and too silly for anyone expecting to be
convinced that they're watching "real" science. The lines are
deliberately dorky, the special effects entirely unconvincing (who
cares?), and the movie adds up to complete absurdity. I've seen it more
than once, and it gets funnier every time. For people who complain that
Dennis Hopper must have been really hard up to have agreed to do it,
what about Charles Dance, a superb actor (Mr. Tulkinghorn in the new
PBS "Bleak House")? They seemed to get the jokes, played it with zest,
and managed to make it fly. I thought it was hysterically funny.

I have to respect movies which promise something and deliver exactly that. 
When I rented this (I was bored tonight) I had absolutely no expectations
for some great piece of art, another Star Wars or Aliens.  It was, however,
a very cute and often amusing piece of sci-fi satire.  (probably my favorite
bit was how the truck's voice was a redneck woman, instead of the usual
authoritative british guy)  If you try to take it seriously, of course
you'll hate it.  But if you rent it because you want to see a beer & popcorn
B-movie, then it's a REALLY good B-movie.  I may have lost 90 minutes of my
life and gained no new insights on the meaning of the universe, but I did
have a good time.

Space Truckers is a perfect B-Movie. It has a title which makes anyone
cringe, and a lightweight plot with no originality, except perhaps the
concept of a square pig. That said, as long as you watch it with no
expectations you will be pleasantly surprised. The quality of acting is
generally good, with a competent cast (particularly Charles Dance)
managing
to avoid laughing their way through the script. The ending however is
almost
unwatchable, yet I can't escape from the feeling that this film is
entertaining, which is all that any movie should aim to
do.

I have to say I really liked this movie. It seemed almost like something
simpler... from another time - a story, romance, adventure, characters...
and most of the money spent on acting talent rather than special effects
(although considering this was presumably a low-budget effort, and I believe
went straight to video, the effects are... well effective - they work and do
their job in the story, even if they're a ways from breath-taking by modern
standards). It held my attention from the opening until the final credits...
I was never even tempted to reach for the fast-forward button... and I
enjoyed it! It made me feel almost like a kid again, reading a comic -
rather a racy, violent comic though... it's definitely not a children's
film. Recommended to anyone who can still enjoy an adventure told with
humour and sincerity, without irony, and without any pretensions to being an
"event movie".

The plot: Space truckers run into problems with space pirates, space
politicians, and killer robots (who, technically, are not space
robots).

Space Truckers is essentially a low budget, B movie space opera that's
a parody of low budget, B movie space operas. It's full of cheesy
lines, cheesy set design, and cheesy special effects. In fact, it's
such a cheesy movie that it sometimes makes The Rocky Horror Picture
Show look like The Godfather. At its heart, this movie is stupid,
pointless, mindless, and has nothing to say about the human condition,
except that it's funny to laugh at bad movies. If you're a Stuart
Gordon fan, that's probably enough for you to enjoy this. As an added
bonus, it's got a great cast, including many B movie veterans.

It can be enjoyed as either a so-bad-it's-good B movie or a clever
parody. Like most Stuart Gordon films, it has rather narrow demographic
appeal, and people who are not genre fans (or Stuart Gordon fans) are
likely to hate it. I love Stanley Kubrick as much as the next film
snob, but the world also needs ridiculous movies like Space Truckers
and The Toxic Avenger. In fact, this movie is something of a marriage
between Troma and New World Pictures. If you're unfamiliar with those
studios -- or you dislike their copious output -- I'd strongly warn you
away from this film. Space Truckers was reviled by the critics,
rejected by audiences, and thought to be unintentionally funny by B
movie fans. Well, for the true believers, this is an awesome movie, and
nothing will ever convince us otherwise. Such is the cult of Stuart
Gordon!
<|_=00=_|>

If you liked "Space Balls" you will also find this movie worthwhile.  Yes,
it is dumb!  The jokes are corny, and the acting is purposefully
bad.
Don't take it too seriously, and it's an enjoyable movie.

I knew this movie was going to be bad going into it.  What surprised
me
though was how much I laughed.  I'm not sure if they meant for this movie
to
be funny but it was a riot.  Space Truckers is a great party movie for the
absolute ridiculousness of the whole thing.  One last thing; SQUARE
PIGS!!!

Oh Golly, where can I begin?

This is state of the art mind boggling (and occasionally numbing) garbage with little if any purpose whatsoever.... I loved
it! I had been hoping to catch this on HBO for monthes, and I got my chance about a week ago.  And it was good.... oh it was
so good!

I'd rank this up there with "Space Balls", if you love cheesy sci-fi with no meaning, real plot or storyline, and no real
reason for being made, check this out....

I can't believe Roger Corman wasn't somehow involved....

****1/2 / *****
Keep on Rockin'

The only thing that makes this movie funny is the fact that they actually
got Dennis Hopper and Stephen Dorff to be in it.  They must have lost a bet
with somebody, and a pretty big one.

The script is so/so.  The dialogue is so/so.  The special effects are
cheesy, but unintentionally, so.  In Gordon's "Fortress" or "Robot Jox," the
special effects were pulled off quite well and looked really great.  But why
on earth would he opt to go for realism, in a movie titled, "Space
Truckers?!"

The production design was intentionally cheesy, and that's the part of the
movie I loved.  "Square Pigs."  "Zero Gravity Beer."  That, friends, is
comedy.

Not quite self-aware enough.  But good for an afternoon rent when you think
all straight-to-video is garbage.  6 of 10.
