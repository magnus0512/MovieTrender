OK, here is the premise. A fireman's (Arnold Schwarzenegger) wife and
son get blown up when a terrorist (Cliff Curtis) is trying to destroy
some target. He googles "terrorist" on his home computer, finds out who
is responsible, and goes off into the jungle to capture him. He
escapes. In the meantime, he hooks up with the terrorist's wife
(Francesca Neri), wins her to his side, and they go off back to the
States to catch him. If that is not the most unbelievable plot you can
imagine, then there are some twists and turns that are even more
incredible.

But, who cares? This is the Governator kicking some major butt like he
did in True Lies, Commando, and many other movies that you and I watch
over and over.

Italian actress Neri (Live Flesh) is hot, Curtis (Whale Rider) makes a
perfect terrorist, and one of my favorites, John Leguizamo (Land of the
Dead), plays a great part. Even Monk's agoraphobic brother, John
Turturro, is here. Wow! But, it's all about the damage, collateral and
otherwise, that draws you to the movie. The fireman turned terminator
turns up the heat (red, of course) and proceeds to erase the terrorist.

I remember a time, in the not too distant past, when any new movie starring
Arnold Schwarzenegger was treated as an event.  Nowadays, his films slip in
and out of town with nary a person even noticing.  What's happened?  The sad
but obvious explanation is that, as he's aged, Arnold has had to make way
for younger, more dynamic action stars, leaving him stuck with leftover
crumbs like `Collateral Damage,' a dull, lackluster action film that manages
to kick itself into high gear only in its final half hour or so. 

`Collateral Damage' was, of course, one of those films whose original
release date had to be postponed in the wake of the September 11th terrorist
attacks.  In this case, the sensitivity arose as a result of the film's
storyline, which revolves around a group of Colombian terrorists determined
to strike at targets on American soil.  Schwarzenegger plays fireman Gordy
Brewer, whose wife and child are killed in an explosion at the Colombian
consulate in Los Angeles.  Brewer, feeling that the U.S. government has
little concern with exacting revenge from the terrorist leader responsible
for the explosion, decides to mount a one-man crusade to see that justice is
ultimately done.  The film, obviously indifferent to its own need for
plausibility, sends this virtually unarmed fireman into the unfamiliar
jungles of South America to take on what appears to be the entire Colombian
police force as well as the guerilla fighters whose actions resulted in the
deaths of Brewer's family.  Brewer, of course, despite his own inexperience
and the formidable odds against him, manages to talk and/or fight his way
out of every dire predicament before rescuing his nemesis' wife and their
adopted son. 

There isn't much to say about `Collateral Damage' except to report that the
film does achieve a certain tension in the closing stretches, when Brewer
returns to Washington D.C. to help foil a plot to detonate a bomb in that
city.  Thanks to a few nice plot twists, the film ends up not being a total
loss when all is finally said and done.

It's never much fun to have to witness an actor in the sunset of his career.
 But if Schwarzenegger's films don't start improving soon, he may well have
to switch to that career in politics he has reportedly been looking into
between films. 

<|_=00=_|>
Yes, another typical Arnold Schwarnegger film which translates to (a)
interesting all the way; (b) very violent; (c) very far-fetched. Here,
Arnold is just a plain old fireman but he turns into superhero, doing
things only Superman or Batman could accomplish....but it's still fun
to watch.

After seeing his wife and kid blown up by Columbian terrorists, Arnold
goes after the latter, traveling to the jungles of that South American
country and taking them on! In the end, he's in Washington trying to
diffuse another terrorist plot. He's amazing. What CAN'T this guy do?
Yes, it's ludicrous....but it's not meant to be taken seriously, folks!
It's just entertainment for fans of action movies, nothing more.

There is a nice twist at the end of this story and it involves a very
intriguing-looking woman, Francesco Neri. I just love that woman's
face: very sexy, especially for someone her age. She's also in
"Hannibal" but I think the rest of her films are Italian. I would like
to see more of her work. 

There are also some short appearances by two always-entertaining
actors, John Turturro and John Leguizimo. Scharwarznegger's action
films usually have a fair amount of tongue-in-cheek humor and those two
actors help along those lines in this film.

Elias Koteas plays the too-gung-ho FBI guy. Hollywood just will not
portray an FBI, CIA, DEA, or any government agent in a positive manner.
That would offend their liberal peers in the movie business, so Koteas
plays the lawman you can't trust in this movie. In fact, they make it
so you don't know if you can trust anyone in the government, which also
is typical Hollywood fare.

Don't believe the national critics, however, if they panned this film.
It's two hours of good escapist fare.
<|_=00=_|>

"You can't take the law into your own hands!"

So says some guy from some government agency to Arnold.  In the preview,
this seems like typically horrible dialog for an action movie.  However, I
was surprised that, in the context that it was used, it wasn't too
cheesy.

I saw a 'behind the scenes' thing on HBO and everyone involved was saying
that this was something really different for Arnie.  Why is it that people
say that about every movie he's in?  They're all the same!  But that's okay.
 We're used to it.  In 'End of Days' he played an alcoholic.  We knew this,
not because we ever saw him drunk, but because some one brought it up every
ten minutes.  These are things that we've come to accept about Arnold's
movies.  So stop telling us that this is something new.

At least, that's what I've felt for a while now.  This movie is a little
different.  It's not a stretch, or anything radically different.  But it
isn't the exact same thing that Arnold's done before.  It is, however, the
same thing we've seen from other people before.  It seems that he looks at
what is popular, and he does his version of that.  People like government
agents, I'll do 'Eraser.'  People like supernatural stuff, I'll do 'End of
Days.'  What's all this I hear about a movie with a twist at the end being
brilliant?  I suppose I'll do 'Collateral Damage.'

So is it good?  Is it bad?  It just is.  One thing I am glad about is that
is was rated R.  I am sick of movies being cut down to PG-13 simply because
some people feel that things should be accessible to the "family."  Cutting
stuff to do that ALWAYS detracts from the quality of a movie.  I've actually
heard directors say that they needed to take the energy level down on a
scene in order to qualify.  Why would you want to do that?

Yes, this movie's release was postponed.  We all have our own opinions on
that and nothing, not even seeing the movie, is going to change our
minds.

One final note: Am I the only one who, when watching Cliff Curtis, can only
think, "You know what I think?  I think you're stealing gold."
?

STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal
Instead*Avoid At All Costs

It's easy to see why this was postponed because of September 11 (even the
terrorist group in the film ALC only needs IADA put on the end of it).What's
hard to understand is how Collateral Damage got released at all.It's hard to
believe this film is directed by Andrew Davis,the director of such action
greats as The Fugitive,Under Siege and Nico.Ageing action man Arnold
Schwarzenegger stars as Gordy Brewer ,the most ridiculously named action
character ever,who goes to Columbia to seek revenge on El Lobo,the terrorist
mastermind who killed his wife and child with a bomb blast on the
Anti-Terrorism Agency in New York.The story is poor (how can a fireman have
so much knowledge on how to locate and take out master terrorists?)as is the
character development,and in fact,so is the action.Truly run-of-the-mill
stuff and nothing that hasn't been done to better and much more impacting
effect in previous films of this type.For this,54 year old Arnie still has
impressive biceps,and things do heat up a bit at the end.But overall,on the
basis of this and his previous films,one thinks the Arn ought to think about
retiring from film and trying harder to become mayor of
California.**
<|_=00=_|>

Ok, so we've all seen at least ONE Arnold movie - and you know what they
say...  "If you've seen one, you've seen 'em all."

This isn't necessarily true in the case of "Collateral Damage".  We expect
Arnold to run into a terrorist compound in the jungle, guns blazing,
unlimited explosives, managing to not get hit by gunfire even while
standing
still in the middle of a field, one-liners running like
water...

But THAT movie was "Commando".  Remember?

Anyway, in "Collateral Damage" Arnold is actually a vulnerable character.
He gets BEAT UP more than he beats up others.  Now, while Arnold fans
(myself included) prefer Arnold to be invincible, in this case it works
really well.  Not just because it moves the story along, but also because
it
makes the protagonist more believable.  Ok, sure, Arnold saying "gracias"
to
some Columbian bus driver is HARDLY believable, but I think you know what
I
mean.

You will also find yourself saying "who is the REAL villain here?" on more
than one occasion.  Sure, terrorists kill.  That's what they do.  But why
do
you THINK they became terrorists to begin with?  "Collateral Damage"
touches
on the subject briefly - enough to humanize the terrorist leader,
even!

Most of the reviews I've read here have been negative...  But those same
reviewers were probably Arnold-philes who were expecting something along
the
lines of "Commando 2".  As it is, personally I really enjoyed "Collateral
Damage."  If not a smart purchase, then it's definitely a wise rental.
Check it out and see for yourself.

Spoilers Ahead:

First, let's give the detractors their due: the movie is too long and
moves slowly. Arnie has some miraculous escapes that strain
credibility. Yet, finally, with a real director Andrew Davis, the movie
departs from Arnie's usual action movie by showing the human costs of
violence. Also, as others have stated, he is not invincible. Unlike
Commando, where he is hiding behind those rosebushes, he gets beat up
and nearly killed several times. Even above this, show me a movie where
so many people dupe him making him look like a total dork. It is a rare
non-flattering, gear demeaning role until the last half hour when he
transforms into the old Arnie we all love. I won't spoil it for you,
suffice to say, the person who is the real villain, and true brains of
the terrorist operation, is not shown until the very end. To be fair to
other Arnie fans, if you enjoy his pure action template (Running Man,
Total Recall, Raw Deal) watch another one of his movies. What killed
this at the box office is the pacing. It is quite slow and depressing
at the beginning when 'The Wolf' explodes his family into low earth
orbit. Here is where better editing would have helped the movie. He
actually is helped by people (Turturro in prison, CIA guys) so that it
isn't the usual Arnie the mastermind, that, forgive me, is not enhanced
by close-ups on his face.

It also was attacked by feminists for his violence against women;
please, she was trying to kill him, get a life. As your action movie
reviewer, yes, it is boring in parts. This really is an attempt by
Arnie to broaden his lobotomized action persona like Stallone did with
CopLand. They were always watching each other, when one did something
the other copied him. Sadly, it is not even close to being the cerebral
CopLand. Yet, it is one of the only pure Arnie dramatic performances
where he plays a human being and not a demigod. Not only does he get
beat up, by men and a woman, but he gets outsmarted and made to look
like a complete ass also. It takes bravery to play a more human role
and it adds needed depth to the movie. After this movie bombed, so much
for Arnie's forays into a dramatic role. The movie follows his revenge
mission into Columbia after the Wolf blew up his wife and son while
targeting some government big shot. Unlike Commando, where he
infiltrates and wipes out a whole army single handed, watch for him
using his brain and not his brawn in this old movie. I know, stop
laughing, look, it makes for a unique Arnie movie. This is a very
accurate depiction of terrorism, their ruthlessness and that, often,
the women are just as or more deadly than the men.

The best part is the last half hour with a serious showdown between
Arnie and the terrorist couple whom, when not in love, enjoy blowing
people to living crap. It is a long, well done action piece that went a
long way to redeeming this one. Yes, there are many superior to this
one but that is comparing apples to oranges; this really is more of a
drama than a pure Arnie action movie. If you want non-stop explosions,
arm snapping and vertebrae adjustments, watch a different movie. Sly
did CopLand in the late 90's Arnie had to make his own foray into
drama. He did surprise me in a few scenes with his pure acting that is
far superior to his shaky readings in many of his more successful
movies. Be warned, the movie is also singular in its utter absence of
humor. Do not expect the usual Arnie one liners delivered with that
hilarious deadpan expression. Curtis does well as the villain but his
wife wins the 'don't turn your back' award with her instant
head-spinning neck snapping of a poor woman Fed. It has many twists and
turns, Davis was always good with suspense and there are a couple real
dramatic curves in this one. Just be warned: slow and more of a drama
than an action movie. If you are expecting Commando, you will just hate
it. For Serious Arnie Fans Only. Not That Bad Of A Movie. Q.E.D.
<|_=00=_|>

I chose to rent this movie for a simple reason: I was in the mood for
something nice and stupid - a no-brainer action flick starring Arnie would
perfectly fit that mood. What I got was something else.

The story: Firefighter loses family in terrorist attack, goes on revenge
mission to Columbia to find and kill terrorist. Sounds pretty dumb to me -
and, let's face it, a lot of aspects of the movie are incredibly dumb.
(Mostly those parts of the movie concerned with Arnie getting to Columbia,
travelling through Columbia and getting into the rebel
camp)

But, and here's the catch, some are not. What starts out a simple movie with
linear plot evolves slowly. After the rage comes a period of reflection.
There are twists and turns in the plot, and the first half is full of
time-filling minutes spent getting to know yet-another-comedic sidekick, who
will disappear entirely from the movie within minutes (couldn't they have
stuck with one sidekick? Or not bothered at all?), but then, as the plot
turns around, the audience is suddenly faced with an interesting moment
(which is later ruined by cheesy dialogue). Well, this being an action
movie, the smart bits can last only so long, and then it all goes to pieces
in a desperate attempt to have a traditional climactic good vs bad battle.
So the end is a big let-down.

Still, the movie IS entertaining (apart from a few minutes of boredom and
confusion in the Columbia part) and, surprisingly, well-acted. Arnie is no
character actor, and the mess he made of End of Days was embarrassing. Sixth
Day brought some more flexing of acting muscles, and I actually liked his
performance in that movie. Collateral Damage takes all he learnt and puts it
to the test. He will never manage a Bruce-Willis alike 6th Sense /
Unbreakable career turnaround, but he acted his role well, and was
convincing. Mostly, at least. The support cast, filled with aforementioned
comedic sidekicks, a CIA agent, a FBI agent and the terrorist and a
Columbian woman - all do their jobs well. I kept wondering where I'd seen
Cliff Curtis before, until I looked it up on IMDB - he was the charismatic
leader of the Iraqi resistance in Three Kings. Here, he manages to dominate
the screen just as well and once again is a show-stealer. Definitely the
most memorable character of the movie.

So, we have good acting, good entertainment, stupid action, a stupid end and
some reasonably intelligent bit somewhere along the way. The body count is
high, but surprisingly, Arnold does not actually kill many people (you can
count his victims on the fingers of one hand). There is a gruesome scene
involving a snake, which is basically pointless, but that did not reduce my
enjoyment of the movie. All in all, a good movie to watch. Not brilliant,
but not as bad as some people may think either.
<|_=00=_|>

Arnie's back and with plot holes galore, a very HOLLYWOOD version of "the
grieving fireman" , filled with tones of acting, fx and script problems,
this movie just mindless action.Laughing at the absurdity of this is this
only saving grace

1 star.

<|_=00=_|>
In an example of Hollywood being at its worst, after Shwartznegger
massively blows Claudio and his wife to ashes in a gas explosion, they
both suddenly reappear a minute later attacking Arnold.

Claudio and his wife are briefly shown as motionless cadavers yet they
suddenly are perfectly coiffed, dressed cleanly, and as strong as ever
with no after effects of being blown up. Ridiculous and insulting! Not
a single hair is singed, no clothing is blackened or burned, and they
are as healthy as horses able to fight Arnold.

Hollywood earns ZERO credibility for producing this kind of poor
quality nonsense. Shame on Arnold for being part of such trashy cinema.

Movies are not worth paying to see if this drivel and folderol is what
Hollywood produces. The public deserves more....far, far more. This
example I discuss was just one of many problems with this movie. Either
Arnold has lost his mojo or he was hungry for dollars to make a
defectively written movie as 'Collateral Damage.'
