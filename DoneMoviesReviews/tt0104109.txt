In many ways, "Dingo" can be thought of as a thinking-person's Crocodile
Dundee. It tells the story of a young man who has lived in the Australian
bush all his life, and had a cathartic moment at age 12 when veteran
jazz-blues trumpeter Billy Cross (Miles Davis) lands his plane on the
local
airstrip and plays an impromptu jazz session. As Cross is about to leave,
the boy tells him that the music is the best thing he'd ever heard. Cross
then says that if the boy is ever in Paris, he should look him up. Twenty
years later, and the boy has become a trumpeter who has always remembered
this invitation. His wife and friends tell him he'll never get to Paris.
The
movie follows the man's passions, and with a spaciousness and sparcity
that
fits in well with the glorious outback. Colin Friels is perfect for the
role.. playing the bush-bred trumpet-playing 'dogger' who is constantly
after a dingo who will not be caught.. just as in his own life, he hangs
onto that twenty-year old dream of going to Paris. In Paris there is
salvation, both for him and the aging, damaged Billy Cross (played
minimally, but effectively, by Davis). And the jam in the Paris nightclub
must rank as one of the great filmed sessions in Jazz history. If you love
jazz or blues, you must see this film. If you love the Australian bush, or
wish to understand it, you must see this film. If you are in neither
category, see it anyway.

Sadly this film is an undiscovered little gem, it was not widely shown in
the United States. Anyone who loves jazz, Miles Davis especially, will wish
to see it.  But you do not have to like jazz to like this film, nor do you
have to be a fan of Australian films to like this film!

It is wonderfully done, a real shame it did not reach wider
audiences. One outstanding performance - although a small one in the
film - is Hans Meyer as the owner of a Paris jazz club.

I won't fight with Phil Kafcaloudes synopsis of the movie, its spot on,
I just wanted to add my comment on the final jazz scene in Paris.

Every time i have described that scene to friends and all, I cry. Tears
of joy mind you,

Reason? Its because of the look on Colin Friels' face,

a kid in candyland for the first time, maybe, you can see he is in
seventh heaven , the only dream he ever had is coming true in front of
us the movie audience and in front of the live audience in the Paris
club,

The moment just takes you to a special place of powerful emotions of
Happiness.

what can i say? i cry at movies , so sue me!! grin

p.s. this is ridiculous even writing a comment has made me cry!!

If there was an 11 I would score 11. I love this film I have watched it
dinned out on it sung about it turned people onto it for years! In a
strange parrallel I'm living out my own version of Dingo due to my
admiration for the film/story/characters. This is without doubt my
favourite Australian film and nobody knows about it! It's going to be a
time capsual thing 100 years from now a new generation and all that
jazz. 

What the film also represents is the maypole that highlights the
seemingly corrupt? Inept, commercially driven world of the Australian
film critic ....Correct me if I'm wrong David and Margaret take a bow
here....this film got completely ignored !?!? WTF! Even the Oscars
snubbed it because the paperwork was filled out incorrectly. Bless. In
a way it's fitting like a pure and perfect M.Davis note. There is no
mistaking that this is his love/life letter to his fans , he is the
man, it's his only film role he also passed just before film got
distribution. I wonder if that mucked up the press junket's. Shame on
you film critics and long live hope and striving for your dreams. I
hope you get there!

I have an old VHS copy of this film and I haven't had a VHS player for
more than a decade. I'm not even sure if this ever came out on DVD,
I've never seen it in a video shop and I have looked through many. This
movie is kind of like an Outback Australian Sci-Fi Jazz Road Trip,
brought to you by the man who blessed us with Bad Boy Bubby. The
opening scene when Miles Davis lands his space ship (commercial
airliner?!?!!), in the desert and proceeds to blow fragile rural minds
to smithereens with an awesome array of Jazz Fusion is priceless. I
pray to the almighty gods of Jazz that they might one day release this
fine film in a format befitting cinema as far out as this.

This was on SBS TV recently in Australia and is still listed on SBS on
Demand http://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/video/369526339639/dingo as of
Feb 2015

I'm a country boy, although growing up in the South-West of Western
Australia is nowhere near as remote as the countryside shown in the
movie.

Still, I could relate to that music, in that setting, as the perfect
eerie accompaniment to the land's empty indifference.

The reviewers who have said it is unrealistic because of the lack of
Aboriginal characters are wrong - I counted at least four in the
background of the 1969 scene - look for the pink shirt and the guy in
the blue tank-top behind the kids at the airport.

The Australian characters are absolutely spot-on, not the caricatures
of Croc Dundee.

I loved this movie - partly as a story about jazz, and jazz musicians.
Along this line, it couldn't have been better than to star Miles Davis.
Knowing nothing of Miles' private life, I wouldn't be in the least
surprised to hear the portrayal of Billy Cross was mostly
autobiographical. If it had been a non-musical actor, the movie would
still be entirely worthwhile. With Miles, Michelle Legrand and Chuck
Finley, the music could only be of the highest caliber and indeed, was.

However, regardless of the jazz aspect, the point of my review is that
this is not just a jazz movie. There are several subplots, which are
about people, each of whom has a dream (a goal dream, not a sleep
dream). At one point, this is even brought up in the dialog, though
it's left appropriately unanswered. The movie follows their lives
towards these dreams. In some characters these dreams are, shall we
say, past.

And of course the scenery, the Australian outback and the streets of
Paris is wonderful. The soundtrack includes the background sound of
these places, so different yet helps us to see what is shared.

When this movie came out it had a one day run in Seattle. What a shame
that it was so brief.
<|_=00=_|>

the only problem, I and others noticed, was the exclusion of Australian
Aborigines. The film depicts the outback Nullabor townships as consisting of
just white people. Therefore the authenticity was ruined
somewhat.
