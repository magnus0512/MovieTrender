I had never heard of this film until I searched amazon.com for my name
(I'm easily amused). An actor with the same name as myself (Kelly
Johnson) was the result of my search and his first film was "Goodbye
Pork Pie." I purchased it straight away. I was so excited to find I
actually enjoyed the film. It's quirky and crazy, a lot of fun, has
great (oftentimes wacky) characters and takes you on a wild ride
through New Zealand. It offers a new view of NZ if you've only seen
films such as one of those "Lord of the Rings" or "Whale Rider" (a
gorgeous example). The fact that it was made in 1981 enhances it's
excellence. Highly recommended as an alternative to Hollywood-style
humour. Adios Pork Pie!

This film is an indispensable piece of Kiwiana. While the humour has
certainly dated, it's still heaps of fun....and an excellent example of
the
road movie genre. Good for including many different locations in New
Zealand, too. Was (and possibly still is) very popular in its native
land.

If you desire a film that has little effect on your psyche, then this is
it.
It has an enjoyment factor to rival many big budget films from both sides
of
the continent. To it's credit is the tiny budget and the 'number 8 fencing
wire' approach by the cameramen at the time. As the Mini is now officially
out of production, it may be of small comfort to know that the car involved
can impress drivers from all walks of life. An icon for Mini enthusiasts as
it shows the versatility of the car and for film buffs as there is more
ad-libbing in the show than in a Michael Parkinson chat
show.
Enjoyable from start to finish, albeit too short and a bit disjointed. A
classic that shows many slices of New Zealand life that no other camera
would dare to cover.
Enjoy.

I'm saddened to report that the region 4 2 disc DVD release has been
cut by about 12 minutes, a series of cuts so severe that it renders
some subplots completely meaningless.

presumably this has been done by the Director, but i still feel
somewhat cheated that a original version isn't available on this "not
so special edition"

However the region 2 DVD is complete,although the picture quality isn't
as good. the fact the region 2 is full frame isn't too bad as the film
was shot that way and theatrically matted to 1.85

my advice is that if you want to see this Kiwi classic the way you
originally remember it get the Region two version

Kelly Johnson and Tony Barry are affably boorish and unaffected as a
couple of aimless, disaffected, alienated everyday nobody ne'er-do-well
blokes -- Johnson's a nutty, reckless juvenile delinquent hell-raiser
while Barry's a dejected middle-aged loser who's just broken up with
his wife -- who decide to make a cross country jaunt across New Zealand
in a tiny stolen yellow rental car in this disarmingly modest and
unpretentious seriocomic road movie delight. The misfit duo
inadvertently become wanted fugitives and subsequent overnight criminal
celebrities when they stiff a gas station attendant out of several
bucks worth of fuel. During their wacky misadventures our scruffy
anti-heroes pick up a daffy lady hitch-hiker (the adorably vacuous
Claire Oberman), cunningly elude the bumbling cops at every turn, and
run into a fair share of eccentrics who want to eagerly capitalize on
their newfound fame and notoriety. Director Geoff Murphy compensates
for the hackneyed chase premise by coaxing funny, endearingly loose and
zany performances from his uniformly excellent cast ("The Quiet Earth"
's Bruno Lawrence has a nice bit as a laid-back, pot-smoking chopshop
owner), dynamically staging a few thrilling automobile stunts, keeping
the pace swift and unflagging throughout, and neatly mining a winningly
droll line in crudely amusing off-color humor. A marvelously mellow
jazz score, beauteous backwoods locations, slick cinematography, and a
plausibly downbeat, yet still satisfying ending round off this likably
lightweight screwball goof of a movie.

A truly entertaining road movie from the early 80's, recently launched
on DVD. From beginning to end, Goodbye P P is full of moments that
charm and make you feel good, blended with those episodes of genuine
depth that are (I think) hard to achieve in a film that sells itself
for it's frothy facade. The acting is pretty good, the camera work very
well done and overall a throughly enjoyable dash through beautiful New
Zealand. There are certain sections of the flick that can seem rather
dull but then again, I haven't seen a film that lacks these entirely.

Despite some dubious scenes (a mini out running an Oz V8 being one of
them), the action sequences are believable, helped by the film and
editing crews' skills.

Watch it and enjoy a surely to be cult classic.

What I found most intriguing about the whole thing was how dated
everything appeared compared to early 80's UK. For those car buffs out
there, check them out and you'll see what I mean but don't let that
distract your attention from the subtle camera moves and as I said
earlier, the quality of the acting.

A classic NZ movie. Two rebels and a stolen yellow mini treat us to a
bunch
of laughs as they stay ahead of the police on a 1000 mile road trip from
top
to bottom of NZ.
Goodbye Pork Pie was a local blockbuster and sold to more overseas
territories than any film of the time
This is available as PAL VHS in NZ for less than $nz15.00 about
$us9.00

Yep great Kiwi movie in it's day, got people back into the movie
theaters showed life the way it was, if you were unhappy with things
the way they were you could just drop everything jump in a car and go.
sadly it is showing it's age a little now, but is still great
entertainment the mini speeding through the streets of wellington is
just great, then driving through the wellington railway station just
great.As for those big Aussie tanks the cops use to use, they always
had trouble catching smaller cars on the Windy narrow roads, only ever
good for the straits. The sad thing is Geoff Murphy didn't make any
more comedy ones after this bit of a shame. got some great actors,
Kelly,Bruno,Don & co. Lots of kiwi jokes. just a great entertaining
movie, i saw it on DVD so bought it, a must have. Shame that movies
like this for good old entertainments sake are seldom made anymore.

Goodbye Pork Pie is one of my favourite movies, mainly because
it covers everything about road trips, hitch-hiking and hassles
with the law in New Zealand. Kiwi's get a real kick from GBPP
because it's a hoot to see the old police cars, the chases in
Wellington CBD, the dope smoking, the small "in" jokes about how
New Zealanders see each other. You might have trouble finding in
in NTSC f

Typical road/buddy movie about two strangers who come together through
circumstance and then bond in their quest to snub authority and the system. 
This time it's done in along trek across New Zealand in a very small (yet
very durable) little car.  Certainly not the most original idea and not the
most plausible either.  Yet the humor is genuinely funny and the characters
are better defined than other movies of similar type (ala GUMBALL RALLY). 
Actor Johnson is particularly good as a rebellious and confused young man
with no constructive outlet to channel his emotions. Overall this is not a
important movie nor even a memorable one, but it is a enetertaining one that
should bring out everyones deep seated desire for independance and
nonconformity.
