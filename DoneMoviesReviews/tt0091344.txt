Don't expect a work of art, but do expect a masterpiece of absurdity
and fun. King Kong Lives is an ultra-cheesy monster flick that's wacky
from beginning to end. Sure it's "bad", but it's also extremely amusing
and entertaining. It's absurdities are part of it's charm. King Kong is
brought back to life and sets about romancing a female giant ape while
squashing nasty humans. I had a great time cheering for Kong while
watching this. It's hard not too cheer for him since he's such a
lovable lug. My heart really went out to him at times. At other times I
just couldn't stop laughing! King Kong Lives will always be one of my
very favorite giant monster run amok movies.

Yep. It's a terrible movie, but worth watching for the laughs. When King
Kong and Lady Kong first meet, they gaze into each other's eyes - and Pow!
It's love at first sight! - and the Love Theme from King Kong Lives starts
swelling up in the background - it brought tears to my eyes. Because I was
laughing so hard I was close to weeping. This movie goes beyond its weird
anthropomorphism and bad writing to achieve an unprecedented new level of
cheese.

There are other fun moments, like when Kong starts climbing a mountain
that
is VERY obviously some painted plywood stuck to the side of a
stepladder.

If you feel like watching something silly, or if you want to see a giant
monkey trying to get to second base, this movie is for
you!

D: John Guillermin. Linda Hamilton; Brian Kerwin; Mike
Starr.

Silly but ambitious sequel to Dino DeLaurentiis' remake of the 1933 classic
monster movie. Of all the wonderful stories that could be told using the
most famous movie ape of all time, screenwriter Ronald Shusset (Alien, Dead
and Buried) opts for a ludicrous tale about an overly involved
scientist/doctor/biologist Hamilton and her emotional quest to save Kong.
Future comedy talent Starr is wasted as a bad tempered facility guard while
co-star Kerwin shows off his Indiana Jones impression as a `wild boy'
adventurer. Only DeLaurentiis could make a good idea this bad. However, for
a genuine Kong fan, this may provide some light entertainment Â– once you
look past the terrible Carlo Rambaldi (King Kong, Alien) visual effects and
the rambling, overlong script. Director Guillermin's final theatrical
effort.

Well I gotta tell ya - when I bought this flick ($4 - yeah...I KNOW I
was
way overcharged)in the late 80's, my kids loved it! As an 8 year old,
you
tend NOT to notice the hilarious dialog, K-Mart effects and Z-Grade
production values. My five year old sobbed her little eyes out when KONG
was
having a coronary...the other three cheered when he wrote off the bad
army
guys so hey, I'm biased! This film made my kids happy so I haven't the
heart
to belittle its achievements - microscopic that they are!

PLUS the fact you get to see Linda Hamilton when she was really pretty
so
c'mon, be charitable - let it be wouldja?

I have yet to read a positive review for this extremely underrated
mildly amusing sequel to the 1976 remake of King Kong, which was also a
great movie but not as good as the original smash fest of the 30s. A
decade after our hero fell from the World Trade Center to his death,
the big ape receives a heart transplant from a giant female gorilla of
the same species, Lady Kong, who he falls in love with. The first time
I heard this idea I figured this movie would suck and just be two guys
in gorilla suits romancing over each other. But having loved its
predecessor I had to check out this truly unique film. Unlike the rest
of the Kong series this is more like a popcorn film that is here
strictly to entertain us and isn't as deep as the previous films.
Another kool thing is that Kong doesn't fall in love with a human girl
(like every other Kong movie) but with an equal size girl ape which is,
I think, a tremendous idea. Linda Hamilton (who I've always loved from
the Terminator series) almost plays the same character she played from
Dante's Peak and is responsible for Kong's blood transfusion. She is a
great actress and came out of this movie OK. Indiana Jones wannabe
Brian Kerwin plays her love interest and is also responsible for Kong's
rebirth upon capturing Lady Kong. He does a superb job as well. The
army is constantly causing problems for the ape couple but our two
heroes (Hamilton and Kerwin) successfully stop them and near the end
the two big apes have a Baby Kong (possibly setting up for another
sequel). Yes this movie could have been called Bride of Kong and had a
lot of high quality action scenes, some of which are actually quite
gory for a Kong film (heads being bit off, people being tore in half,
rubber alligators being chewed up) and seems a lot like a Godzilla
film. Sure the plot gets a little silly and having two giant gorillas
cuddle each other and act like humans is a bit much, but all the cheesy
scenes are mediocre at best. And yes I did hate some of it, mostly the
army scenes and the rubber alligator scene (really bad FX there) but
being the sixth film in the Kong series, what more do you want? Seeing
Kong smash stuff will make me happy. I now have this film in my Kong
DVD collection along with King Kong '33, Son of Kong, and King Kong '76
(the two Japanese films will join them soon), I even have Might Joe
Young though I don't count that as part of the series. I have now
reviewed all the Kong films except the brand new 2005 remake which i
simply can't wait to see. Review for that coming soon! Overall, I
really enjoyed this film and it wasn't as bad as I expected nor as bad
as people say. I give this worthy entry to the Kong series and great
sequel to the 70's movie a 6/10.

King Kong Lives starts off with the final few minutes from the original
King Kong (1976) as the giant Gorilla seemingly falls to his death from
the World Trade Center in New York. Jump to 'Atlanta Institute, Georgia
Ten Years Later' where they have Kong (Peter Elliott) on a life support
system waiting to undergo a heart transplant(!). Dr. Amy Franklin
(Linda Hamilton) is ready to perform the operation but Kong needs a
steady supply of blood to survive the procedure, as luck would have it
diamond mercenary Hank Mitchell (Brian Kerwin) has found a lady Kong
(George Yiasoumi) while trekking through the Borneo jungle. In no time
whatsoever the institute has brought the female & the operation has
taken place with the artificial heart going in nicely. The operation is
a success & Kong lives, the institute decides to keep both Gorillas but
when Kong hears the female call out he uses all his strength to break
free from his chains & go in search of a mate, obviously the United
States Army can't have giant apes running around can they so it's up to
Colonel Nevitt (John Ashton) to capture them by whatever means
necessary...

Directed by John Guillermin &, according to the IMDb an uncredited
Charles McCracken, this is the sequel to the '76 remake of King Kong
which Guillermin also directed. In my humble opinion I think King Kong
Lives is one of those so-bad-it's-good abominations that I simply can't
believe someone green lighted & trust me King Kong Lives is a bad film
through & through. The script by Roland Shusett & Steven Pressfield is
absolutely hilarious at times, you won't know weather to laugh or cry
at some of the stuff that makes it's way into this film. I think King
Kong Lives is meant to be a serious film but scenes such as the heart
transplant complete with massive over-sized medical instruments, the
giant artificial heart that needs to be lowered into Kong's chest using
a crane(!) & all filmed in complete seriousness, there's a bit when
Kong manages to 'sneak' up behind an entire platoon of soldiers, for
Christs sake Kong is a 50 foot Gorilla couldn't any of these dumb
soldiers see him? The scenes in which Kong & Lady Kong romanticise with
hugs, 'I love you' type looks & Kong wanting to give her something so
he uproots a bunch of trees & tries to give her those! The entire
concept is bizarre, daft & just complete total & utter nonsense while
at times it becomes embarrassing to watch. But having said that it
moves along like a rocket & is never dull or boring, when all said &
done I found King Kong Lives to be a throughly entertaining film for
all the wrong reasons.

Director Guillermin messes everything up, there is no excitement,
scares, tension or any action although it is quite funny on numerous
occasions. The whole mood of the film is wrong considering just how
stupid it is. There are a few snippets of violence & gore, Kong's
removed heart, someone is snapped in two, Kong eats someone as well as
a load of crocodiles & he gets shot at the end.

With a supposed budget of over $30,000,000 King Kong Lives is a
travesty, where did all the money go? The special effects are worse
than the '76 version in my opinion because of the 10 year gap, didn't
special effects move on at all during that period? If you put King Kong
'76 & King Kong Lives side-by-side you would think not. It really is
just a man in a rubber monkey suit from beginning to end, the full size
hand & arm shots are awful as they just look so stiff & unnatural. For
30 big ones King Kong Lives is a shoddily produced film & doesn't look
the part at all. The acting is about as good as you would expect from
such a silly film, I wonder if the cast knew how bad this was going to
turn out to be?

King Kong Lives provides 100 odd minutes of pure entertainment for me,
it's a crap film but it's just so bad it's good. It's a bit like a
train wreck, you know you shouldn't look but you can't take your eyes
off it. An absolute treat for bad film fans!

This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think
about all the time.                                     

                           Some minor spoilers

King Kong Lives starts right where the 1977 version left off.KKL is very
good movie and is really a super sequel.Its made very well and the acting
and effects is very good but the movie is just plain sad.I guess all lovers
of Apes will cry if they see this movie.I don`t want to spoil it it for you
but there is lots of action and the film is never boring.I really like the
scene where King Kong walks through the swamp and is all you see is fog then
and black sky.That is so neat.I wouldn`t recommend this movie to people who
dislike animals getting hurt.If you like King Kong but don`t like to see the
great ape get hurt then I recommend that you see King Kong vs. Godzilla and
King Kong Escapes.In them movies he is unstoppable.The music it terriffic!
Its by John Scott.Its a great score.Overall King Kong Lives is great
movie!

After remaking the 1933 classic,Dino decided to film a sequel.Bad
idea.Although this was the first movie I ever saw on video,I wasn't
impressed.And I was five!I watched it again last night and I was laughing so
hard,I actually CRIED!It was a joke.It was FUN!Spoilers alert!A horny female
Kong was discovered on Borneo and the resurrected King Kong fell in love
with her...Awwwwww!How romantic!But the army is hot on her tail,so Kong must
protect her.That's about it.The effects are good,the 'actors' suck,the
script is UNBELIEVABLE but make no mistake:King Kong is still the mightiest
monster ever to grace the silver screen.Godzilla was running away from the
army in his 1998 revival,but Kong thrashes tanks and humvees here.The movie
is boring,but they tried to make some inside jokes here people.There are
many references to "The amazing colossal man","War of the colossal
beast","Queen Kong","Alligator" and so forth.This film is extremely funny
but what If Dino had produced "King Kong Battles The Killer Whale" also?He
was thinking about it...
<|_=00=_|>
King Kong Lives is a worthy successor to such cinematic classics as
King Kong '76, Konga, and King Kong Escapes. It's also one of the most
insanely entertaining monster movies ever made. It's tremendously fun
and highly goofy. The surgical scene in which Linda Hamilton
transplants a huge mechanical heart(!)in Kong's chest is just one of
the astounding spectacles in this entertaining over-the-top sequel to
Kong '76. I had so much fun watching King Kong Lives that I went out
and bought it on DVD. I expected it to be off-the-wall and wasn't
disappointed. I'm giving King Kong Lives a 10 star rating for it's
extreme entertainment value. I loved it.
<|_=00=_|>
Kong is back and this time it's personal! lol! This flick is a blast
for B movie fans and those of us who love monsters! The rest of you
will hate it. I love this! Linda Hamilton shines here and there's
plenty of humor, action, gator munchin', redneck chompin', and tank
smashin' fun! A poster for this one said that "America's biggest hero"
was back..."and he's not happy"! That's the truth! When the human bad
guys mess with the King's lady he's one big furry fury and nobody does
it like The King does it people! I love this for all the reasons others
hate it. It's a hoot! King Kong Lives delivers the goods when you are
in one of those moods to enjoy fun cheese featuring a big romantic
monkey with a mechanical heart rippin' assh*les in half and smashin'
'em to kindom come. This is the ONLY film to watch when you are in that
type of mood folks. There's really no other film like it! Way to go big
fella! ALL HAIL THE KING!
