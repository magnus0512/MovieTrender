It does amaze me at times to see what are considered camp classics and
then
see how so many people can miss an obvious one. This is one film that
truly
has it all...drunken midgets, nazi spies, princess leia, and a host of
off-colour jokes sure to offend ALL. Seriously, if your a member of the
PC
thought police this film will give you reason to write your congressman
(or
is it congressperson?) but if you are intelligent enough to realize that
when everyone is being poked fun at no one is stigmatized then you might
just enjoy this comedic spoof which is as frantic and disjointed as the
plot.

One last point regarding the "munchkins": although it might be easy to
see
this film as taking liberty with the rumors (and some were true) that the
midgets who acted in the Wizard of Oz were wild drinking partiers, it
should
be noted that this notion goes just as far to show how normal this
population is; just as interested in getting drunk, laid, and having a
good
time as the rest of society. A very human face which has not always been
offered to actors who are seen primarily in fantasy films (Oz, Willy
Wonka,
Time Bandits, and even Tiny Town). I do know that the actors on this film
were paid better than those on Oz and certainly had no problem with the
script in giving their enjoyable performances.

A fun ride

With a bit of dark humor thrown in. This is one of my top favorite movies.
Mistaken identities and foiled evil plots abound. Those concerned with its
lack of "political correctness" should relax and not be so serious. One
reviewer said that, if there was anyone they missed making fun of, it must
have been only because they ran out of film stock. Exactly! This film has
equal opportunity humor. A Japanese friend of mine, personally not known for
his tremendous sense of humor, thought the film was hilarious, and has
watched it several times, laughing hardest at the Japanese
caricatures.

I highly recommend this overlooked gem. Get it, watch it, loosen up and
laugh.

That's right...this movie is as campy and goofy as you can get and one
almost wonders why the stars that were in it (at the time) decided that
THIS
was a film that they wanted to be in...but...to watch it again...it's
almost
like a precursor to a Seinfeld episode whereas the many plots all come
together at the end to make a very funny and often overlooked film...come
on...if Rocky Horror is regarded as a classic, why can't this film?...it
has
a plethora of midgets, Japanese tourists and spies...Chevy Chase in his
prime...and is a takeoff of the Wizard of Oz?...how much more odd can you
get...a definite rental that grows on you!

Chevy Chase, Carrie Fisher, Pat McCormack, Billy Barty, Eve Arden,
Joseph Maher, Adam Arkin, Cork Hubbard, Robert Donner Â– how could it
not be good. The temporary manager (Arkin) of the Culver Hotel, across
from MGM in 1939, changes its name to Hotel Rainbow to take advantage
of the publicity surrounding the soon-to-be shot Wizard of Oz. It works
as the studio's talent agent (Fisher) books rooms for all of their
wouldbe munchkins. So, we start with hundreds of partying little people
who make a Shriners convention look like a religious retreat. Throw in
an FBI agent (Chase) protecting a traveling Duke (Maher) and Duchess
(Arden) from a crazed assassin (Donner), and then a couple of dozen
photo- snapping Japanese tourists whose bus breaks down in front of the
hotel. Finally, sift in a Japanese agent (Mako) and a dwarf Nazi spy
(Barty) who are looking for each other in a hotel full of Japanese and
dwarfs. The plot is decent without getting in the way of the comedy,
the acting is great, and the dialogue is often superb (What floor do
you want? Ballroom. Oh' I'm sorry, I didn't know I was crowding you.)
All in all, it's a great way to spend an afternoon.

What a great underrated movie. Everywhere I look it gets awful reviews,
but they don't seem to take into account the campiness of the movie. It
doesn't make fun on little people, or at least it doesn't poke more fun
at them than anyone else! It makes fun of everyone! If you can find it,
at least rent it and give it a try. If you watch it, you'll want to buy
it... I did.

My whole family enjoyed the movie, and I believe yours will to...
Wholesome fun for anyone who enjoys spoofs of spy movies or comedies in
general.

Chevy Chase is at his prime and best in this movie, sure the script
isn't great, but what movie in this genre is? The slap-stick of the
movie is incredible and the acting is above most in the category! 

I have several friends that happen to be little people, and they all
enjoyed the movie, and didn't find it offensive in the least. The
writers make fun of everyone, while not belittling anyone (except Nazi
war criminals, give it a chance!)...
<|_=00=_|>

I remember this film film as among my favorites growing up.  Forget the
fact
that it is absolutely politically incorrect.  Of all my friends growing up
(Japanese, African-American, and yes event a "little person") we all have
found it hysterical over the years.  The movie excited my imagination
beyond
most other films.  While no jewel of the cinema, it will always hold a
spot
in my psychological toy chest, with Fletch, Foul Play, Time Bandits, and
other movies too busy entertaining than to think about
oversensativities.

This is a great movie that satirizes Hollywood stereotypes in a fun
filled slapstick romp. Sadly, many people miss the point of satire, and
will only see the stereotypes. They will not enjoy the movie, but then
why do people with no sense of humor even pick up a comedy??

The main character is led through an unbelievable sequence of events
while staying at a hotel awaiting a tryout for "The Wizard of Oz". The
hotel is filled with hopefuls for the Munchkin parts, and has been
chosen as a supposedly quiet meeting place for a Japanese and German
spy to exchange info.

The German is a midget, and the addition of a Japanese tour bus
stopping at the hotel makes the meeting of these two spies quite a
mess.

toss in lots of slapstick, satire, and chase fun, and you have a comedy
romp that the whole family can belly laugh to.

But it was supposed to be a spoof. I could not stop laughing as the
movie was so much of a farce I found it to keep me laughing all the
time. I would not recommend it for theater view but if you have never
seen the movie I would say its worth watching as a rental as the cost
of it is so little now. You could rent something much more costly and
worse like Dead Calm. I found that all the dumb things that happened
such as trying to keep the suicidal dog in the picture just more then
my sides could take at times. When that dog jumped out of the window
for the ball I lost it. How could you not think something as this movie
which I assume was to be as "B" a movie as anyone could possibly make
not be funny? I found it much better then the Vacation movies by far. I
would say that this review has a spoiler but this movie cant be spoiled
as there is no real plot.

I know I will be in the minority but I love this film! ( you are probably
even more confused by that statement if you see the films I like most in my
review postings.) I found the film fun and light hearted. Chevy Chase is at
his best,Carrie Fisher is amusing, gutsy and quite fetching. Joseph Maher
and eve Arden almost steal the film as the Duke and Dutchess and A
pre-Chicago Hope Adam ARKIN shines as the hotel manager. Yes, I give you
the
fact that some of the jokes may seem very un-p.c. today but they are not
malicous,its all in fun. (OH, and did I mention that this film gave the
great Billy Barty his best role in years? )

This movie is a farce. It's big, broad humor... or little broad humor,
to be accurate because most of the actors are little people.

The Culver Hotel played host to all of the actors who played munchkins
during the filming of The Wizard of Oz. Apparently, it was a debacle.
The actors partied, drank, and wreaked havoc on the hotel during a stay
that has become legendary in Los Angeles.

While the specific events of this film are fictional, most of the movie
is indeed based on a true event. 

Now, of course a great story doesn't always make for a good movie. This
is indeed a broad, goofy, slapstick comedy. Whatever your level of
offense at ethnic and physical stereotypes, some of the humor is
groan-worthy.
