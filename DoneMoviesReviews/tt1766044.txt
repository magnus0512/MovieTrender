The official story on this page made me laugh... Who the hell has
written this??! 

"Tanya Neubivko has never been in love but optimistically is searing
for it." WHAT??? She's Death for god's sake! Have you watched the movie
at all? 

"Her unfortunate and even dangerous encounters with strangers on dates
almost got her killed." WHAT again? I believe it was written about some
other movie.

"Rita is happily engaged and planning a wedding after a routine medical
check-up." WH... oh c'mon... she's diagnosed to die in a couple of
weeks, why is she so happy? 

"Nadya is a very unhappy doctor who hates her husband and finds relief
in alcohol." .... her husband? She's not married.

"The story takes place in a surreal hospital with the leaking roof and
hollow walls and constantly smoking doctors" May be it's "surreal" for
USA, but it's a common municipal hospital for Russia or Ukraine. The
only surreal thing was windows blocked with the bricks, but I'm sure
there are lots of hospitals in the small Russian tows where you can see
this too. 

P.S The movie is a masterpiece. Watch it if you liked Renata
Litvinova's other movie called "Boginya: kak ya polyubila". They have a
lot in common.
