I read the book "The Sum of All Fears" with fascination--Palestenians
discover an Isreali nuclear device lost when the aircraft is shot down in
the six day war, sell it to Al Queda, and the arab terrorists proceed to
blow up Denver with said nuke.

I was very much looking forward to this movie, only to find that for fear
of
offending Al Queda, the director and screenwriters had substituted some
ridiculous plot about German Nazi's and turned the whole thing into a
melodramatic hash.

This could have been a GREAT, prophetic, movie.  instead it became a silly
waste of money and talent.  I know Tom Clancy hated the movie, so did I.

 "The Sum of All Fears" is the latest film in the Jack Ryan series as
written by Tom Clancy. In the previous films, Ryan was presented as a family
man and played by Alex Baldwin and Harrison Ford. This time around we are
asked to accept a Ryan who is 25 years younger (Ben Affleck), unmarried and
a nerdy, wet behind the ears CIA historian. The age difference would have
been more believable had the film been set in 1973, when the story begins,
rather than the present.

 Anyway, the story is about a disgruntled ex-Nazi, Dressler (Alan Bates) who
acquires a nuclear device and plans to instigate a war between the USA and
Russia and then take over when the super powers destroy each other. The new
Russian President, Nemerov (Ciaran Hinds) is set up by Dressler to be blamed
for a nuculear attack which wipes out a large part of Baltimore. U.S.
President Fowler (James Cromwell) calls in the CIA headed by William Cabot
(Morgan Freeman). 

 Cabot enlists the aide of historian Jack Ryan (Affleck) because Ryan has
done a thorough study on Nemerov. Ryan believes the Russian to be innocent
even though all around him believe him guilty. As each side prepares to
launch their respective missles, Ryan and CIA Operative John Clark (Liev
Schrieber) are busily gathering information and Ryan is racing against the
clock to convince Fowler of Nemenov's innocence.

 Affleck tries his best to make us forget Harrison Ford but to no avail. He
simply cannot be taken seriously as the man who holds the world's fate in
his hands. Freeman is excellent as always and Cromwell and Hinds stand out
as the two world leaders. Bates makes a nasty villain and Schrieber is good
as the mysterious man with a past, Clark. Bridget Moynahan appears as
Affleck's love interest and future wife.

 The real star of the picture are the special effects. The nuclear explosion
is realistic and believable and the attack on the aircraft carrier is
equally good.

 I hope that in the next Jack Ryan movie, he is portrayed by someone who is
at least old enough to shave.

OK, I enjoyed the movie. But I also have read the book several times,
and the comparisons are inevitable, as several other people have done.

I just don't see the point of the most obvious changes from the novel :
why using a Neo Nazi fanatic instead of Middle East terrorists? why a
very young and single Jack Ryan instead of a married and older
character? (Harrison Ford would have been terrific again) Of course a
scene aboard Air Force One is more eye candy that a President trapped
on Camp David because of a storm and a damaged helicopter. And : where
is Ding Chavez??? A character from "Clear and Present Danger", is
almost adopted by John Clark after being rescued, and they work as
partners.

Some gaps on the story are too difficult to accept : you mean that the
ONLY person able to communicate that the bomb was not Russian, is a
obscure junior CIA adviser? what about all the agencies and personnel
deployed on the explosion site? are they all mute? (On the book, Ryan
passes the information but he is not believed by a hostile President
and his Nac.Sec. Adviser, *and* a possible power struggle on the
Russian government is completely left out).And how come that you can
link without any problem from a Palm in the middle of a burned city?
<|_=00=_|>

Let me preface my comments by saying that I loved Clancy's book when I
first
read it ten years ago.  It was a gripping page-turner, and a marvelously
intricate work, building suspense in layers.  I've since re-read it several
times.

I realistically expected that elements of the massive tome would have to be
changed or condensed for the screen version.  But so much is changed, and
so
many critical elements removed, that it hardly resembles its novel origins.
As a result I find it difficult to believe that Tom Clancy had much
creative
control over this effort, though he's credited as "Executive Producer".

First, for some inexplicable reason, this movie jumps away from previous
Clancy continuity by completely revamping the character of Jack Ryan.
Rather than a middle aged CIA administrator, Ryan is now a young handsome
PhD with little Washington experience.  Apparently this is to boost the
"chick-flick" quotient of this outing, as it adds nothing tangible to the
film, and only detracts from the continuity that had been built to this
point.  There's even a scene where Kathy is asked how "cute" Ryan is on a
1-10 scale, and she says a "12".  Ugh! They had time to include this
garbage, yet skip vital character development later in the film?

Yet, even worse, this Ryan is the Uber-Ryan.  Yes, the man is everywhere,
and involved in virtually every action sequence in the film.  He finds the
bomb lab in Russia (and saves Clark, CLARK, for crying out loud, shouldn't
it be the OTHER way around???), races to Baltimore in a helicopter to warn
President Fowler(who in yet another huge change is caught in the blast
himself) he gets caught in the nuclear blast(and hardly gets his hair
mussed, how cliche!), he personally sifts through the rubble of Baltimore
for evidence (another inexplicable change, as Denver was the city nuked in
the book, then goes on for a cliched confrontation with the terrorists (who
are VERY poorly developed character-wise, totally unlike the book) mano y
mano in a darkened Baltimore warehouse.   Oh, and I almost forgot, there
was
the obligatory (and oh so overused) Hollywood "death" scene where Ryan
(again, Ryan personally) kneels at the bed of Morgan Freeman as he expires
in a "tearful" sequence.  Yes, it was painful but not in the way
intended.

I thought Clancy's books sometimes stretched the believablity of Ryan's
capabilities to the breaking point, yet this goes way beyond anything
Clancy
has previously done.   It's Super-Ryan to the rescue, more 007 than
distinguished, cerebral CIA analyst, even though he supposedly had little
if
any experience in espionage, forensics, or any of that.  It is very
cliched,
and very tiresome to watch, at least for anyone that's actually read the
books.

One of the best parts of the novel was the realism.  Reading it, you really
believed that the plot Clancy put in motion could occur.  Not this movie.
Believable Islamic terrorists were replaced with cartoonish middle-aged
white european neo-Nazis who make stock Hitler-loving speeches that any
avid
movie-goer has heard a million times before.  Dr. Evil would love these
guys.  They even got to kill one of their own rank, ala Dr. Evil, after he
experienced the convenient cinematic "crisis of concience".  You could see
it coming a mile away!  I guess that's so we can understand these men are
serious and mean "business"

Oh and on the subject of business, since the typical european Neo-Nazi is
young, skinheaded, devoted, but not terribly affluent these Nazis were
conveniently well-to-do businessmen with the financial assets and
experience
to put their scheme in motion.  Is this Tom Clancy or James Bond?  I guess
its not "politically correct" to feature the actual type of real world
Middle Eastern "gentlemen", with the aid of foreign government sponsorship
who even now are striving, again in reality, to make weapons of mass
destruction to use against us?  I guess its always "safe" to once again
bash
caucasian conservative-appearing men in business suits.  Whatever the
reason, its another major plot element from the book down the
tubes.

On the subject of the bomb;  there was a great deal of detail in the book
about the bomb that was completely overlooked in the movie.  For example,
in
the book, the bomb was originally intended to be a multi-stage, ie,
HYDROGEN
bomb.  It fizzled.  The original yield was overestimated by twenty fold by
military analysts because of reflection of the snow, and other factors.
The
President's advisors didn't think terrorists could build a multi-stage
weapon, thus the suspicion was immediately upon the Russians. It was only
after frantic detective work that the true yield of the bomb was
discovered,
and it put Ryan on the proper track AND gave him leverage to help defuse
the
situation(no pun intended).  It's a common worry that terrorist groups
might
get ahold of a low yield fission "suitcase" bombs, yet right from the start
in the movie no one, including the President, suspects
terrorists!

Another fond memory I have of the book is that Clancy took us to the very
brink of Armageddon where the US and Russia were nearly in a shooting war
because of the misinterpreted size of the bomb, and the tank battle that
the
German terrorists cause to happen in Berlin.  Yet here, the Russians attack
and virtually destroy a US nuclear carrier, we bomb a Russian airbase, and
we're still standing at that brink.  Somehow, I think if events got that
far, there'd be no turning back.  Clancy seemed to know that when he wrote
the book;  he seems to have forgotten it here though.

These are just a few of the major problems with this film.  The pacing is
bad;  one minute the bomb is still being constructed, and a few minutes
later its already placed in Baltimore and about to explode, with the cliche
of Ryan hot on the trail, trying to warn the President.  In the book, the
bomb catches everyone completely off-guard, but not here, ANOTHER
irritating
change.  There is also very little character development, the President's
motivations are poorly understood, the paranoia of Fowler over the new
Russian President's motives was poorly developed, etc etc.

Avoid it if you can.  I turned the last 5 minutes off, it was so
bad.

As usual, I am very glad I saw the movie BEFORE I read the reviews on
this site. Why do soooo many reviewers here have to compare the movie
to the book? A book allows 300-400 pages (or more) to develop plots and
characters. We are reviewing movies on IMDb, not books. I guess
reviewers here want to appear erudite by scraping up details from the
book that get omitted or distorted on the screen. I am a very active
reader, but I simply cannot read every book that makes it to the movie
theatres. Writing a book (a fairly isolated event) is a significantly
different event than producing a movie which involves countless people
and issues: screenwriters, actors, writers, directors, production
people, locations, etc., etc. Making all these book to movie
comparisons isn't fair to the movie or the book. Many times I just want
to watch a movie and judge it on its merits alone - as a movie, period.
I did not read this book, but I watched the movie and found it very
entertaining and extremely absorbing.
<|_=00=_|>

This is a ridiculous movie. First the casting of Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan
just doesn't make sense, chronologically (he's already been played by the
much older Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin) or physically  Affleck just
isn't commanding enough for the role. Secondly the movie is simply
capitalizing on North America's new found fear of terrorism on home turf,
and thirdly the screenwriter Paul Attanasio took huge liberties with the Tom
Clancy novel, including, in a stroke of misguided political correctness,
changing the bad guys from Middle Eastern to Nazis. Of course everyone hates
Nazis, so the filmmakers are not going to offend anyone (Hollywood finds it
so hard to get good hateful villains now that Russia is no longer communist)
but are we to believe that there is a worldwide conspiracy by super-rich and
powerful Nazis to pit two world powers against one another? And how, after
the blast (yes, there is a huge atomic explosion), does Ben Affleck piece
together this entire conspiracy using only a cell phone and a palm pilot?
I'm willing to suspend disbelief in most movies, but this movie has holes
big enough to fly a jet through.

 "The Sum of All Fears," based on the # 1 New York Times bestselling novel
by Tom Clancy, features Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan, a historian who somehow or
another, by writing a paper on the new Russian leader, is spotted by the CIA
Deputy Director (Morgan Freeman). 

 "The Sum of All Fears" is even more powerful in this day and age, but
nevertheless, it stands nowhere near as great as the novel, which is usually
the case with films taken from books. In the following I will point out some
differences that weren't crucial to my opinion on the film, but just
interesting.

 The film is a prequel to the other Jack Ryan films, while the novel was a
sequel to the other books. In the book, a lost Israeli nuclear warhead is
picked up by Arabs some twenty years after the war it was lost in. In the
film, a modern-age Hitler is attempting to begin turmoil between Russia and
the U.S. with the nuke -- there are no arabs. Also in the novel, the way the
bomb was sneaked into the superbowl was much more interesting than the
method they used in the film. Also, in the book, Morgan Freeman's character
was a dumb man who hid throughout the novel. In the film he's a
hero.

 There's countless other things that don't really matter, but still made me
a bit disappointed in the film.

 The film was in no way awful, and is the best Tom Clancy movie to date, but
it's still not as good as the book.

3.5/5 stars --

This film was a far cry from the book by Tom Clancy, who wrote about Al
Queda terrorists reading a set off a nuclear bomb in America. The
latter must have been sick watching this movie and typically-Left Wing
Hollywood changed the script to being one with Nazis as the villains
instead.

Are you kidding me? How ridiculously politically correct is that? If I
had known this beforehand, I would have boycotted this insulting movie,
instead of wasting money on it.

Also, at least to me, Harrison Ford will always be "Jack Ryan," not
some second-rate pretty- boy actor like Ben Affleck. 

The only redeeming qualities to this film were the nice cinematography
and the awesome sound when the big bomb went off. If you have a
surround sound, that scene will rock your room. Too bad, they didn't
blow up this film before it was released.
<|_=00=_|>

Final Score: 4.0 (out of 10)

The movie adaptation of Tom Clancy's "The Sum of All Fears" might be a
starkly frightening movie, could be a cautionary tale of homeland terrorism
and nuclear war - that is, if it wasn't caught in the confounding cinematic
time-warp it finds itself in. It is primarily set after the fall of the
Berlin wall and the end of the nuclear arms race with the Russians, however
it's also a prequel with a younger, cocky Jack Ryan (plug-in flavor of the
month Ben Affleck) and with the  principle villains being Nazis. This movie
will probably be remembered more for it's unfortunate post-9/11 release date
(which gave it a sense of importance) then the silly story and content. It's
not even so much that the Nazis-as-bad-guys thing is an overused, now out of
date cliche as much as the idea that they were Middle Eastern terrorists in
Clancy's book and the writers and director Phil Robinson changed them smacks
of pure political correctness. Nobody wants to offend the terrorists. As a
result the movie feels phony. And that's a big problem because we feel
detached from it and, thus, don't feel it is as sharp, timely and intense as
Clancy meant it to be. The reason that movies like "Fail Safe" and "Dr.
Strangelove" were so brilliant is because they were gutsy enough to take on
the public's fears directly. This movie isn't, in fact, it goes out of it's
way to hide in it's phony world from doing anything gutsy. All movie
villains have to be white Anglo Saxon Europeans most likely with `sinister'
Russian or German accents. This type of stuff might frighten liberal
Hollywood types who think the president might drop nukes at any moment, but
it's not going to resonate with most people. 

It also doesn't help that we can't connect with the characters. Affleck does
a fine job or running around yelling, but there isn't a lot of development
in the young Ryan or in any character we meet. Robinson's direction is
purely rudimentary. The whole thing has the feel of a clumsy TV movie. It's
race-against-the-clock gives us no real payoff. There is exactly one really
good scene here involving Morgan Freeman, a cell phone and a stadium full of
people. It also has one interesting little monologue about how the internet
and technology has connected terrorism globally like never before. But
without any characters, eye-candy action or resonating story we're left
pondering why we wasted our time on this thing. 

Alternate viewing recommendation: "24 - Season 2". Kiefer Sutherland's Jack
Bauer runs circles around Ryan in generally the same plot only more intense,
frighteningly timely and on a more epic scale.

People seem to expect jack Ryan movies to be more or less the way they
imagine the books to be. This phenomenon is almost never the case when
a movie comes out BASED ON THE BOOK. I emphasis BASED because it is
never MEANT to be exactly what the book is. In "Sum Of All Fears",
there is a switch from Arab to Fascist terrorists. Sure, some scenes
are changed and others, unfortunately, left out. But being that the
book is only based on the story, it is NOT GOINT TO BE the story
itself. Somethings don't translate well on screen. A book is several
hundred pages long. A movie two hours, and they can't very well put
every detail from the book into the movie. I saw the film and thought
it was good. I also saw all the other Clancy films and enjoyed them for
what they were. Maybe not so good by comparison to the book, but never
the less good for what they were. As for some characters, for example,
Mary Pat Foley would have been unrecognized had it not been for the
credits. She is known more for her role as a spy in "Cardinal of the
Kremlin", which would make a great movie, if they ever did it.
