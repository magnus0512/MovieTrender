This is one of those films you can't help enjoying. It's light, fun,
undemanding, and an absolute joy to watch. It might not be a gritty urban
drama that deals sensitively with youth and alienation in high school, but
then neither was "Heathers".

Cinema primarily exists to entertain, and "Only The Strong" does this in
spades. Dacascos is the most graceful, watchable martial arts star since
Brandon Lee, with an easy charisma that really comes across in a film like
this and also the brilliant "Drive". The rest of the cast perform quite
nicely as well. The plot and characterisation are admittedly 2-D, but what
the hell, it's a 100% schmaltz-free feelgood movie.

Two of my friends actually took up Capoeira after watching this film. How's
that for life-changing?

The real star of "Only the Strong" is the capoeira style of Brazilian
martial arts (which is the pre-cursor of many break dancing moves)
exhibited throughout the film. There are many movies that concentrate
on wushu, taekwondo, karate, aikido, and many others styles from
different parts of the world, but capoeira movies are far and few
between, which makes "Only the Strong" that much more unique.

The story is nothing short of rehashed and predictable; a well meaning
soldier (Mark Dacascos) with martial arts background from his previous
station in Brazil, comes back to the U.S. and attempts to take charge
of the rebellious, rival students in a troubled neighbourhood. He
attempts to give them a focus in life with the art of capoeira, which
combines martial arts, music and dancing, as well as stressing teamwork
between the players/fighters. The troublesome students take a while to
be won over by Decascos efforts, but eventually play along.

Things get complicated when it turns out that one of the students is
the son of a Portuguese gangster, a capoeira maestre himself, that is
the terror of the town, leading to some battles and a showdown between
the ruthless criminal and his followers and the well meaning teacher.

The acting and the story is sub-par as mentioned previously, but this
is , at the time of this writing, the only movie focusing on capoeira
as a whole, and as such deserves a closer look by martial arts fans
everywhere who are ready for something truly different.

If you are looking for a plot or a great cinematic feature, you may be
disappointed. However, if you want to see some great Capoera (brazilian
style) fighting, this is for you. This relatively unknown art is exciting
and explosive, with many flips and tumbles along with strikes used to
incapacitate your opponent. I am a fan of the Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee
movies, but this type of martial art has found a place in my heart. The
movie is a great good guy overcomes insurmountable odds to come out on
top.
Very entertaining.

ONLY THE STRONG 

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1

Sound format: Dolby Stereo SR

A former Green Beret (Mark Dacascos) is employed by his local high
school to rehabilitate some of its worst students by teaching them the
art of capoeira (a form of martial arts from Brazil, using dance-like
moves). But his work brings him into conflict with a local drug lord
(Paco Christian Prieto), whose operations are threatened by Dacascos'
interference...

Predictable B-movie, elevated above the routine by virtue of its slick
presentation and interesting cast (including Geoffrey Lewis), under the
assured direction of Sheldon Lettich (DOUBLE IMPACT). The capoeira
sequences are exotic and colorful, which blunts the impact of some
pretty heavy fight scenes, and the script is alternately naive and
obvious. However, the virtues are considerable: Ultra-buff Dacascos
flaunts his pumped-up torso through a variety of tight-fitting vests
(drool! slobber!), while ultra-cute Stacey Travis (the romantic
interest) hovers around the periphery just long enough to temper the
film's relentless macho swagger. Good, catchy music score, too.
<|_=00=_|>

An exciting feel-good actioner from the director of Double Impact that
demands very little from its audience other than the odd cry of adulation
at
the spectacular, slow-mo'-induced action scenes set before us. Capoeira,
the
rhythm-based Brazilian martial art / dance, is the movie's chosen subject,
and its saving grace: flamboyant and effortlessly acrobatic, accurately
pulled off by a cast of the style's best practitioners. Dacascos masters
the
art while stationed in Brazil working as a Green Beret, and returns to his
old school in Miami to find the classes out of control, made up of petty
criminals and drug dealers. He is chosen to teach these crazy kids some
discipline (by means of Capoeira), and they seem to become pretty good at
it. Prieto provides the beefcake villain element as a Brazilian
master-criminal determined to sway one of our hero's prime students. All
in
all, this is an entertaining watch, a perfect showcase for Dacascos.

I really enjoy this movie and have shown it to most of my friends. Most of
my friends and I gave it an eight out of ten and some even higher. I think
that the capoeira scenes are great, plus it has good music, but the story
and characters could've been presented a little better. If you like
martial
arts movies and don't care too much about character development, you'll
probably like this movie.

A young ex-military man returns to former high school to find it
in
moral shambles. He gets an idea to try to help out a few of the worst
behaved students in the school from his former teacher and
mentor.
It was rough going to get them involved in the program especially
since
the criminal family members of the kids were reluctant to let them
go.
Fights over that ensue But in the end good over evil wins!!!!!!!! I
loved
it.  Especially being a mother myself I loved the storyline!
<|_=00=_|>

You know whats going to happen to all the "bad" students as soon as you see
them. But, this is still a very good movie. The style used is really
amazing
and fun to watch. The fights scenes are very good.  Why this movie wasn't a
big hit, I'll never know. It should have made Mark Dacascos a
star.

I thought Only the Strong was a great movie.  I would love to learn the
martial art.  I thought that Ryan Bollman, as well as the rest of the
cast,
was wonderful. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good movie.  I
loved this movie, and am currently trying to find it on
video.

I think that the movie is awesome!!!!!!! It displays great
skills
as well as potential and understanding.
In the movie...Luis Stevens ( Mark Dacascos ) teaches the
guys,not
only martial arts,but compassion and understanding towards
each other.
They are great actors who really fit the parts that were
required......actors who really brought the characters to
life.
Just a few actors...i think,who did a great job and are worth
mentioning....... Richard Coca,Mark Dacascos,Paco Christian Prieto,Ryan
Bollman,Stacey Travis,Mark Cardwell.The others,although they are not
mentioned.....have done a great job also.
All in all........'Only The Strong'.......in my opinion is an
action packed......thriller movie.It's a must see.I rate it
10.
