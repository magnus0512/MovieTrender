Really, how to make something original, fresh and odd out of absolutely
nothing except a few characters? Using characters, only characters and
nothing except characters. That's the simple formula Brooks uses in all of
his work, but, for me, he has never created so much charm, warmth and
sensibility as he did in `As good as it gets'.

Characters write the screenplay in this movie, and everything that happens -
happens because of what they are. They are nothing special Â– they are
ordinary people we meet in the street every day and that have the same
problems a lot of other people have. This movie presents the example of how
much you can pull out of that. And if that is written as well as it is in
this case, not even a happy ending can bother you. Because, in real life,
shown here, what is the end?

Everything is good and warm in this movie, everything is fresh and
vivacious, understandable and well performed. Jack Nicholson brings one of
the best performances of his career, that terrific Helen Hunt finally got a
chance to show how skilfully an actor can connect naturalism with the laws
of the camera performance, and Greg Kinnear shows the most convincing
emotions coming from a gay character I've ever seen.

The relationships between the characters are created in the way that you
can't predict anything that's going to happen, eventhough you know in
advance what could come out of their mouth and what kind of attitude they'll
have in a certain situation.

You can simply feel the progressive collaboration that occurred between
Brooks and the actors and the mutual understanding they developed, and it's
not often that you see that kind of artistic superstructure shining on the
screen so much as it does here.

I find `As good as it gets' complexed, vital, intelligent, emotionally deep
and studied, fresh, original, amusing, cheerful, funny, and one of the best
films of 1997.

"As Good As It Gets" boasts a splendid, delightful combination of
wonderful, zesty acting and a remarkably bright and effective
screenplay. Jack Nicholson is pitch-perfect as the obsessive-compulsive
curmudgeon Melvin Udall, who possesses some of the strangest and most
curious tendencies ever concocted by screenwriters; his Udall is so
human, so heartfelt, so genuine, and so whimsical and Nicholson
perfects him to such a degree that not a moment of his screen time is
unwanted or uninteresting: in my valid opinion, this is Nicholson's
best performance of his career, and one of the most reverent
performances in film history. What an engaging, enthralling story: an
troubled, insecure man helps a troubled, insecure waitress (troubled
and insecure in different respects), and the two form an unlikely
relationship from being distant acquaintances (Hunt even exclaims that
Nicholson is crazy in their most uncomfortable moment in the film) to
practical soul mates (Nicholson to Hunt: "I feel that I'm the only
person that knows that you are the greatest woman alive"), through a
series of misfortunes, self-explorations, and mutual bondings.
Kinnear's character Simon has the distinct purpose in being both the
bridge and the divider of Nicholson and Hunt's relationship, and he
identifies with his character with compassion and understanding, as he
has frequently been wronged throughout his existence. The most curious
aspect to a story such as this, involving such unduly, diverse
characters: a miserable recluse, a zesty, yet insecure waitress, and a
sensitive and insightful, yet wronged homosexual, is that in their
distinct differences, they share many of the same problems, and these
problems eventually bring them all together, although hardly in a
civilized manner. I appreciated practically every element in this
wonderful, delightful masterpiece of exemplary romantic comedy, in its
indelible acting (Oscars well deserved), its whimsical, touching
screenplay (This was neons above "Good Will Hunting"'s quality) and its
comforting morale, that despite all of the great odds in life which
prevent us from being happy, we can perhaps find it within ourselves to
take that one important step in reversing our fortunes, in "stopping
with taking pills" and to allow our lives, and our desires to shine and
be realized, as this story depicts life. The best romantic comedy,
certainly the best film of 1997, and one of the greatest films of all
time, "As Good As It Gets" succeeds in practically every entertaining
and endearing cinematic respect. **** out of ****
<|_=00=_|>

Comedies (especially romantic comedies) can only be judged by how much they
make you laugh and if they make you feel good inside. As Good As It Gets
does it for me every time. I'm not just saying this on account of being a
"Jack fan." The characters are so beautifully drawn, you forget it's just
Jamie from "Mad About You" (Helen Hunt) and the man with the eyebrows
(Nicholson). This movie deserved all of its Oscars, and then some. The role
of an obsessive-compulsive is an easy one to parody and mock to death, but
Jack does it with style, humour, emotion, and that usual Nicholson flair.
Hunt has never been better as a waitress with a major anxiety to do
something for herself for a change. Greg Kinnear is also very good as a gay
artist that ends up having to turn to the irascible Jack for help after he
is scarred and left destitute following a break-in. This is such a special
comedy, fresh from the pen of James L. Brooks, the man behind the wonderful
Terms of Endearment (another wonderful Nicholson performance) and Broadcast
News. As Good As It Gets made me feel so good, even though I couldn't really
relate to the characters' situations. The humor is pure Jack, set to the
script with perfect ease. The emotions evoked by the actors are also
authentic and heart-felt, as if they love what they are acting out. Movies
like this come few and far between, and that is the reason why I appreciate
this film so very much. As Good As It Gets was one of the best films of
1997.                     Rating: Four stars.

Melvin is a romantic novelist who is a selfish manic compulsive who is rude
and insulting to all he meets.  When Melvin's gay neighbour is beaten up and
robbed, Melvin agrees to look after his dog.  The dog gives Melvin something
to care about other than himself and his life is approaching normal until
his regular waitress has to leave work to look after her asthmatic son and
his neighbour wants his dog back.  Melvin starts to realise that his life
needs others for more than just selfish reasons.

The big Oscar winner for Jack is recent years is enjoyable if you come to it
knowing what to expect.  The film is very sentimental but in a good way. 
The film is gently comic and amusing and the characters (although
exaggerated) are winning and involving.  The telling is a little long winded
at times and the film could have been shorter but it is still enjoyable.  It
does tip over into sickly sentimentality at times and can be a bit syrupy
but it comes with the territory.

Nicholson is excellent and is the main reason it all works well.  His un-PC
Melvin is funny but also a character that you can hate and pity on several
occasions.  Kinnear is good because he is a solid understated character and
not hammy or OTT like he can be.  Hunt is good but is left with the majority
of the syrup and sentiment where the other characters get more share of the
laughs.  Gooding Jr continues his trend of being good in over the top roles
and is funny and happily avoids becoming a flaming gay
stereotype.

Overall this is a sentimental romantic comedy that is typical for the genre.
 The story wanders to it's point but the good cast, led by a great
Nicholson, hold the whole thing together.  A superior piece of
sentimentality.
<|_=00=_|>

Jack Nicholson is simply phenomenal.  Yes, I will give credit where it is
due and congratulate Greg Kinnear, Helen Hunt, and Cuba Gooding, Jr, on
their fine performances.  They are talented.  But I am mesmorized by Jack's
intricate facial expressions and inflection each time I see this movie.

Critics panned this movie for being totally unbelievable.  I would have to
agree-why would Carol fall for Melvin?  Why does Melvin change his ways
after so many years of acid-tongued insults?  I don't know.  I know people
who disliked the film because Melvin was such a you-know-what.  Personally,
I love the evil retorts he hurls at any innocent bystander.  Maybe it's a
sick pleasure, but Nicholson's delivery is perfect and I couldn't help but
laugh as he takes on everyone.

As Good As It Gets is one of those incredibly moving films that is also
hugely entertaining. It's not just a comedy, you can't quite label it a
drama piece, it just is what it is; simply great.

What works here so well are the actors and the script. Nicholson and
Hunt both won Oscars and they're simply great but Kinnear is no less
effective as Nicholson gay neighbour. Plus that dog is amazing as well.
This film really relies on great performances and there's no shortage
of that here.

As Good As It Gets is also remarkably well written. So well defined
characters and completely involving, you quite simply grow to love them
and sympathize with their plight. Nicholson's remarks are terrific,
each one very quotable (personal fav; I think of a man and I take away
reason and accountability).

Direction is first rate, Brooks made Terms of Endearment so it's well
established that he's quite capable of making great films. As Good As
It Gets is very nearly as good it gets.

Jack Nicholson is one of those actors who impresses me the second (and I'm
not overstating in the least bit) he appears on screen.  The moment I see
Jack's face on screen, I get this feeling that everything's going to be
all
right.  He could do a Pauly Shore film, and elevate its quality with his
mere presence.  And I didn't even get to his acting.

Nicholson won a well-deserved Oscar for this movie.  Then again, I feel
like
he deserves an Oscar for virtually everything he's been in.  Hell, you can
even give him an Oscar nod for "Anger Management."  THAT'S how great he
is!
He's one of those actors who can communicate even more emotion when he's
not
saying anything than when he is.  And of course, he has one of the coolest
movie star voices ever, so it makes it a joy whenever he does speak.  I
still feel like "You can't handle the truth!" wouldn't be as priceless a
line if Jack didn't yell it.  He can say almost any line of dialogue and
turn it into gold.  In this movie it was "You make me wanna be a better
man."  Again, an otherwise forgettable line of dialogue made gold by Jack.

"As Good As It Gets" is a flawed film, with scenes that drag and an
overlong
running time, but it's highly enjoyable and altogether pretty
well-written.
Aside from its many hilarious moments, it's also quite touching.  But I
have
to admit that it's the comedy that sticks out most in my memory.  There's
some priceless gags like when a Jewish couple is sitting at Jack's usual
table.  He first intrudes into their conversation saying, "People who
speak
in metaphors oughtta shampoo my crotch."  He complains to Helen Hunt, his
usual waitress, saying "I have Jews at my table!"  He then intrudes in the
couple's conversation again, noticing the food on their table, saying
"Obviously your appetites aren't as big as your noses."  Now, I probably
wouldn't want to personally know a man like Melvin in my real life, but I
still found those cracks to be hysterically funny.  The same when he
attacks
Greg Kinnear's gay character with constant homosexual slurs.

The performances are great all-around.  Though Jack pretty much steals the
show, Greg Kinnear gives a wonderfully endearing performance.  He doesn't
play out the gay stereotypes, yet he's sensitive and feminine enough to
have
me convinced that he is gay (unlike Eric McCormack on "Will and Grace" who
acts like he's gay for the sake of the show's gimmick).  It's nice to see
Kinnear rise from the host of "Talk Soup" and the thankless late night
talk
show "Later" to a fine actor.  Previously, I wouldn't have any notion that
he could become what he is now.  Helen Hunt also gives a compelling,
emotionally packed performance.  And Shirley Knight, as her mother,
provides
a little bit of comic relief.  Cuba Gooding Jr. has a small but
interesting
role, and he makes the best of it.

The film does have its dull moments, but Jack's one-of-a-kind performance
makes it all worthwhile.  There is nobody, and I mean NOBODY, who could've
played Melvin better than him.  I read in the trivia that John Travolta
was
originally offered the role.  Now, I like Travolta, but in this type of
role
he wouldn't hold a candle to Jack.

My score:  7 (out of 10)    
<|_=00=_|>

This movie is bizarre because, while judged overall its story is shmaltzy
and unbelievable, nevertheless each individual scene plays absolutely
convincingly and feels very real. It's weird. I don't know if it's just the
greatness of the actors overcoming an under-thought out script, or whether
it's just the script concentrated solely on crafting great scenes one after
the other, but not so much in coming up with a convincing through-line.
Whatever. All I know is that this is one of the most entertaining pictures
I've ever seen, extremely funny and quite emotionally affecting in places.
Somehow, it just doesn't matter - I like it anyway.

The performances are uniformly excellent. Nicholson shows real range here -
sure, he gets to be the sarcastic curmudgeon we've all come to expect, but
his character also has moments of fear, repression and vulnerability which
he brings off equally well. My problem with this character (and the
"problem" only exists as I think about him afterward, not while I'm actually
watching the movie) is in his conception: he seems to be whatever the
writers want him to be at that moment, with no particular consistency from
scene to scene so when he supposedly "changes" at the end, we're left to
think, "Change? This guy's been changing through the entire movie!" And
also, the fact that his character is a romance novelist is never really
explained or examined in any way.

And yet, Nicholson's performance makes it not matter quite so
much.

Helen Hunt is a revelation in this movie - she nails every scene she's in,
whether she's forced to be witty, embarrassed, angry, defiant, emotionally
overwhelmed, whatever. She keeps Jack on his toes, and they work off each
other brilliantly. Also, I never thought I'd find myself saying this, but
Greg Kinnear was great as Simon, the gay neighbor.   (It was also nice to
see
director Harold Ramis - the third Ghostbuster, after all - in front of the
camera again, if only briefly, in a small part as a doctor.)

What more can I say? Good comedy, good love story, great acting. None of it,
in the end, is very convincing, but if you just focus on the individual
moments and not on the grand design - a task made easy by the wonderful
writing and playing - it's very easy to like As Good As It Gets.

Directed by Oscar nominee James L. Brooks, the story written by Mark Andrus
brings up not only very interesting characters but also very interesting
issues.  I have the video and enjoy watching it. The CD is great with music
of Nat King Cole, Shawn Colkin. Outstanding acting by Helen Hunt (Mad About
You, Twister) who won an Oscar for this role where she plays Carol
Connelly,
a single mother, working as waitress in Manhattan, New York. A single
parent
trying to cope with her work and paying medical bills for son Spencer
Connelly, played by  Jesse James (Message in a Bottle, The Gingerbread Men,
Gods and Monsters).
Jack Nicholson (A Few Good Men, Easy Rider, Witches of Eastwick)  is Melvin
Udall who is an obsessive compulsive.  Nicholson also won an Oscar for his
part. His obsessive compulsiveness has taken over his life and he is not
able to live a normal life.  Melvin Udall  has tons of soap all organized
in
his medicine cabinet.  He uses a bar of soap once and then throws it out.
He
will not step on a crack on the side walk but skips to the next block of
concrete. When he goes to the restaurant he brings his own plastic fork,
knife and spoon in a plastic bag. Udall uses plastic gloves to hold the dog
and has all his office supply stacked and all color coordinated in his
home/office. He eats at the same restaurant, sits at the same table, if
someone is seating at his table he insults them to make them leave so that
he has his table back, wants the same waiter Carol to wait on him, and
takes
forever to take a shower. He closes his door several times and counts how
many times he has done it.
As a writer who works at home I do understand Mr. Udall really well.
Writers
think somewhat like this: we like to be alone with ourselves in order to
think. We have to go inside ourselves to produce good work. It is a very
isolated world. We do not like to be bothered unless we are bored, or
tired,
in which case we want to communicate with the outside world for a brief
period of time, then after one hour or so we want to go back inside
ourselves again and be left alone. This is somehow like Melvin thinks.
People think that he has nothing to do and they keep knocking at his door
and he gets really aggravated about that.  He is my favorite character in
this movie, not to diminish the other ones. He is just so full on nuances
that make him very entertaining. Helen's role is very, very, good and she
did a really good job with it.
Greg Kinnear (Sabrina) is Simon Bishop, the artist who is Udall's next door
neighbor who finally has Melvin turning into a little more normal human
being and he is there to teach him many life lessons.  The supporting
actors
are great,  you have Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. (Jerry Maguire) playing
Frank Sachs, Simon's agent.

My favorite scenes: elementary school kids all in uniform screaming: "Wait!
Melvin,  wait"! Greg Kinnear imitating Melvin. Melvin and Caroll going to
eat fresh rolls in the wee hours of the morning. When Melvin realizes that
the dog is also skipping cracks on the sidewalk.

My favorite quote: "I am drowning  here and you are describing the water."
This is a nice story telling movie. I recommend it!

<|_=00=_|>

Now I know what good acting means. You are absolutely surrounded with it in
this movie. There is not a single actor or actress in this movie that didn't
exceed himself/herself. Helen Hunt is great (I don;t know why, but I find
her quite attractive) and I won't bore you about the performance given by
Jack Nicholson.
When I first saw this movie I thought it was really boring and overrated,
but I saw it again the second day and immediately loved it. Maybe the ending
is a little bogus, but it's a romantic comedy, so it didn't bother me that
much.  
A fairly complicated plot presented with ease and simplicity works perfectly
and there's a nostalgic tone to the movie in whole.
 Maybe because it's a rare occasion nowadays to come across a movie that
isn't stuffed with special effects. This is a movie that should be seen on a
beautiful day, when you're in a good mood. 

Great fun that keeps getting better and better each time I see it.  A strong
8/10.
