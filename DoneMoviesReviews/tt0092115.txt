I'm more biased toward liking this movie because I kinda grew up on it.  As
pathetic as it is 
to say now, certain scenes were too scary for me to even
watch.

Anyway, it's a really cute and fanciful movie full of imaginative whatnot. 
I mean, come on!  
An ancient troll takes over a modern apartment building, transforming it
into a faerie tale 
wilderness, complete with a chorus of singing trolls. 
Wonderful.

A couple of friends and I got into a craze of watching cheesy old
horror films on the weekends because there is nothing else to do in a
small town... But anyway, we rented this one and laughed like never
before, it is so insane! We love the "Creature Symphony" part where all
of the troll creatures start singing some gibberish song, it is
hilarious. We still laugh about it randomly to this day. This movie has
maybe half a minute worth of scariness, unless you are afraid of
midgets. By the way, the little man in the movie is superb LOL with his
little story that he tells. I recommend this film to everyone to see
once, because once is all it takes and once is all you really could
take. It is a crappy horror film, but a great comedy!!

I rather liked this one a bit, though I can see from its score that I am in
the minority in my opinion.  Though at least most can agree this one is a
lot better than the sequel.  This movie has a family moving into a new
apartment complex.  Very quickly the little girl is taken by the title
character and he takes her place.  Throughout the movie the troll disguised
as the little girl moves from one apartment to the next turning each room
into a seemingly new dimension or something.  The girl's brother has his
suspicious and teams with this old woman to figure things out.  The old
woman seems to know a lot and she looks a lot better with her hair down. 
Soon the entire apartment becomes part of this world the troll is creating
and the boy must finish it off because the old lady just is not in the
position to help at the end.  Rather fanciful and interesting...nothing to
take to seriously, but I thought it was a rather good story and movie.

This movie is not that great, but not as awful as you might hear. It's
mostly a fantasy/horror/comedy that isn't too ambitious yet was weird enough
to make a good midnight cult movie. The short eighty minutes weren't
unbearable, and there was plenty of things that didn't make too much sense.
1: If everything in the fairy land was completely evil, how come the witch
had the talking mushroom? 2: How come the troll didn't want the girl to die.
Yes, the ending was pretty anti-climatic and some of the jokes missed,
though some hit straight on. But this movie is worthy as its genre: a
ridiculous 80's creature flick. Although, there is one very awesome musical
number as the trolls are partying, which is just greatly scored and edited,
other than that, nothing special unless you like creature/Full Moon flicks.
6/10

They play TROLL on TV every once and awhile and like a train wreck, its
hard to look away. Its so bad its almost good. Almost. But not quite.
What can you really say about an '80s film that boasts both Sonny Bono
and Julia "Elaine from Seinfeld" Louis Dreyfuss??? The casting here is
so strange that it reels the mind. Noah "NeverEnding Story" Hathaway??
Shelly Hack?? In short, a boy finds a mysterious land o' TROLLs in the
basement of his new apartment building. The TROLLS are cheesy to be
sure and the whole thing is silly,I guess. But there is something
endearing about watching a little boy rescue his cute little sister who
suddenly growls and bites people, something weird about watching June
Lockhart play with her pet singing mushroom right before she morphs
into a total blonde, buxom she-babe. I even love the friendly little
dwarf man! TROLL is cheesy but in an inoffensive fun way, unlike it's
sequel TROLL 2 which is a terrible cult classic that is painful to
watch.

I have to give this movie a 6/10 because this is a very decent film
that deserves praise. I don't know why so many people hate it. For one
the little evil character, Troll, has a personality. The kids have
personality as well and they're not some stupid one-sided characters.
There are funny jokes inserted in the dialogue and the people who
occupy the apartment are funny too. Unlike some movies from the same
era this one actually has pretty good special effects that are pretty
scary too. Just wait till you see a guy turn into a bunch of plants!
Thats gross, but its also good effects. Check this movie out and
remember it has nothing to do with the really crappy movie Troll 2.

The Potter family has just moved to a rented apartment in San
Francisco. Harry Potter Sr. (Michael Moriarty) and his wife Anne
(Shelley Hack) are bringing the packages to the apartment and their son
Harry Jr. (Noah Hathaway) and their little daughter Wendy Anne (Jenny
Beck) stays on the sidewalk. Wendy goes to the laundry room, she meets
the wicked troll Torok (Phil Fondacaro) that uses his magic ring to
possess Wendy and to use her form to transform the dwellers and their
apartment into other trolls and his kingdom. Harry Jr. feels that
something is wrong with his sister and seeks out help with the good
witch Eunice St. Clair (June Lockhart) that lives in the building. 

"Troll" is another lame movie of creatures in the 80's but also a cult-
movie. Michael Moriarty in the role of Harry Potter Sr. is so
ridiculous that becomes funny. The symphony of the creatures singing in
troll language is one of the best moments of this movie. My vote is
six.

Title (Brazil): "Troll"

And fans who loved that one will definitely want to check this one out
as well, since it contains the same brand of cheesy humor & gross slimy
monsters. The story goes like this, a family moves into a grungy
apartment, where an evil troll from another dimension possesses &
assumes the identity of their little daughter, the only ones who knows
what's going on is an ancient witch & a young boy, who must not only
save the young man's family, but the entire world from going to the
trolls!. I had a good time watching this one, I enjoyed GHOULIES & this
one was equally entertaining as well, the direction & make up work not
to mention the acting, was great & TROLL has several slimy & humorous
moments to keep you hooked from beginning to end. Followed by a sequel,
TROLL 2 which a lot of people hated & isn't really a sequel, but I dug
it in a cheesy B movie sort of way & supposedly a TROLL 3, which I
viewed & can honestly say that it's about as much as a sequel to this
one, as Friday THE 13TH PART 2 is to FOOTLOOSE, which is to say there
are no trolls in it, it's about killer vines! 

**** stars

I don't like scary movies, so when I saw they Shelley Hack was going to be
in this one, I figured it was going to be a good choice.  I was right.  She
looked good, and that was about all. 

On the Witches' Sabbath, Harry and Anne Potter and their children Wendy and
Harry Jr. move into an apartment building where a number of quirky people
live.  Wendy goes into the laundry room and meets Torok, an evil-looking
creature.  Harry Jr. goes into the same laundry room but doesn't see Torok
because, using a green ring, he has the ability to change his appearance. 

The experience of running into Torok is apparently very traumatic for Wendy.
 While not exactly Linda Blair in 'The Exorcist' (I've only seen clips from
that one, and that's all I want to see), she does worry her parents quite a
bit.  Meanwhile, residents of the building start disappearing
mysteriously.

Jenny Beck was wonderful as Wendy, and she appeared to be having a good time
acting in a way kids can only fantasize about behaving.  Phil Fondacaro also
gave a very good performance as Malcolm, an English professor who was
shorter than young Wendy and became her friend.  The movie's most memorable
scene is one between the two of them that seemed out of place in a movie
like this but made sense later.  Fondacaro also appeared in the credits as
the troll, who was more adorable than scary, a quality you could see in his
eyes (which must have been Fondacaro's). Anne Lockhart also did well as the
mysterious Eunice, who lived upstairs and became Harry Jr.'s friend. As for
Sonny Bono's performance as a not-so-suave ladies man, I think he made the
right choice going into politics, because his talents in government are
well-documented (though I liked him a lot when he performed with Cher and in
many other TV appearances).

This movie may be a little too scary for young children, but the various
monsters still had a cartoonish quality about them.  Overall, the movie was
more comedy than horror, though toward the end horror would describe it
better. 

It's not a bad movie, really.

This movie is good.;) Yeah... - different , interesting Sarcastic ,
dark comedy...And... I like how the little girl always has this really
evil smirk on her face.But she faked me out a bit when she was
eating....(huh, ew) The parts with Sonny Bono - those are so silly. All
the little earth wandering trolls keep coming out of the woodwork...
And they look hilariously silly putty - ish. Freaky , funny stuff. Oh -
'86...
