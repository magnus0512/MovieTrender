I like the idea of the panic room, but the room itself has to be much
better
than the one in the movie. And too many things in the movie that do not
make
sense: (POSSIBLE SPOILERS, so do not read on if you dont' want to be
spoiled, but the movie is SO predictable anyway)

1. You call 911 and get placed on hold after you tell them your address
and
it's an emergency?
2. Cell phones don't work in the room? If it was a room designed for the
purpose as described in the beginning of the movie, shouldn't cell phones
be
usable in it?
3. Isn't it obvious to just kill all the surveilance cameras all over the
house so people in the room won't know what you're doing?
4. Can't Jodie Foster tell the cops something or signal something since
she
was in the room before and should know they can't hear her from inside the
room?
5. How can someone get smashed in the head like that not only not die, but
still has the power to wrestle someone down and try to kill
her?
etc.etc. please write a better script next time Fincher.
<|_=00=_|>
David Fincher directs this cleverly conceived thriller about a mother
and daughter trapped inside a panic room by three criminals. The film
is well-paced and the camera work is slick. The film does well in
exploring the confines of the house. Jodie Foster is effective and
maintains a high intensity throughout. Kristen Stewart is decent as her
daughter. Forest Whitaker plays a slightly sympathetic criminal and
does well. Unfortunately, after an engrossing game of cat and mouse,
the conclusion is weak. Staple clich√©s crop up and the film goes for a
crowd-pleasing finale that doesn't quite feel right. Still watchable.

Overall 7/10
<|_=00=_|>
I really love Jodie. I heard that she had rejected Hannibal millions
dollars job offer because its script was stupid. So what in the Earth
made her accept working in this piece of garbage called Panic Room?
Forest Whitaker is a great actor too. I cannot believe both of them
appear here! I would give no stars to this movie, but these 2 great
actors make me save their performance.

Producers made a big mistake with the casting. Probably they spent all
the money paying Jodie and Forest, so they put only garbage actors to
complete the group. This is not unusual. The masked criminal does not
look menacing without his mask at all. And the little girl is cute and
a good actress but she seems a boy. In fact, when I watched the trailer
I thought it was a boy! She not only seems a boy because of her haircut
but because she has boys manners!

***spoilers ahead***

The storyline is stupid from the very first minute. Anyway the movie
was good at first specially because the camera amazing movements and
CGI. After the bad guys break into the house everything is very
predictable, full of plot holes and it goes only to show the characters
stupidity:

1- Why do they get a house so big while they are only 2 small people?
This house is for about 5 people! Without live-in help it is impossible
to have that house clean!

2- There are lots of noises when the guys first talk takes place, they
even shout (in lower voice), Meg cannot sleep, she is wide awake but
she does not hear ANYTHING.

3- Why the guys do not leave the girls alone trapped inside the
elevator if what they want is in the panic room?

4- The 911 never put you on hold, and if so, I might think they are
able to track your call and send an unit.

5- The fire thing is no real. Gas does not remain in the ceiling and
also the carafe outside should have exploited burning the 3 criminals
and the explosion should be noisy enough to alert neighbors.

6- It is incredible that both mom and daughter do not wonder what the
criminals want from the room and try to negotiate.

7- At first it is impossible to talk from outside to inside, but later
it is! Sounds strange that the big guy who built the room does not know
about the intercom and this new owner does.

8- At the end, it is stupid that Burnham comes back to the house
because he hears a shout, the police sirens were sounded nearby
already. Also it is stupid that Burnham let the bank bonds go with the
wind, because he could have raised his hands keeping the papers in his
jacket.

I will not continue with plot holes because it would be endless, but I
have to say that I am tired of "Terminator skills" at the end of all
thrillers. How can I guy survive while he has a hand damaged, he is
hammered on the head and he fell one floor down? He still has a
supernatural strength to fight 3 people! As I said all the movie is
predictable from the start to the end. If you watch this movie with
someone else I suggest a guessing game and probably you will guess
everything! For example, what do you think a neighbor will do if
someone in front is bothering him with flashing lights? I understand
the Morse code idea, but face it... only a few among regular people get
it.

Another thing, the finale is tasteless... I felt saying "And where is
the panic that appeared in the movie title?"
<|_=00=_|>
Way ahead of it's time. If you can come up with a story based in a
single room and make it as engaging and exciting as this one... you
deserve to be frozen and preserved for future teaching of inspiring
film makers. This is a fantastic film and I'm glad Jodie Foster was
available for the lead when Nicole Kidman got knocked up and bailed. I
loved the off-character casting of Jared Leto and the unbelievable
casting of Dwight Yoakam... DWIGHT YOAKAM. Everything worked. Another
great, and yet again... underrated film by David Fincher. How long is
it going to take for an established directed like Fincher to take a
chance and roll the dice on trying to make a script like this work
again? ...No one has the guts.

Panic Room (2002)

There are three reasons to see Panic Room. 1) The titles: understated,
gorgeous, uncanny letters floating in the Manhattan cityscape. 2) The
photography: camera moving like an animal, slipping between tiny
spaces, swinging across rooms and through floors, inhabiting the screen
like another character. 3) Forest Whitaker, again (he's so good so
often it's hard to not expect a great performance).

The rest of the film is very good, directed with style and intelligence
as usual by David Fincher (who did Seven and Fight Club). The plot is
good, but maybe a little conventional overall, and if the details
aren't completely predictable, the general flow of events is. The whole
cast is quite good--Foster in a familiar embattled, determined role,
and Jared Leto is an appropriately crazed, if slightly caricatured, bad
guy who just wants money. Don't we all.

I saw this when it came out and was dazzled and yet disappointed by the
plot. The second time, knowing the events, I was able to just watch how
they unfolded, and it was much better. Expect suspense, intensity, and
beautiful camera-work.
<|_=00=_|>

In her first suspense-thriller since her Academy-Award winning turn in "The
Silence of the Lambs", Jodie Foster registers quite well as middle-aged New
Yorker Meg Altman, who moves into an EXTREMELY spacious brownstone with her
daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart), a diabetic tomboy.  The building is
equipped with a special shelter designed in the event of a break-in, known
as a 'panic room'.  Meg and Sarah waste no time in putting the
claustrophobic area to use (on their first night, no less) when a trio of
burglars (Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam) make their way into
her building to retrieve a large sum of money.  The catch is that the
burglars' stash is in the very room in which Meg and her daughter are
hiding!  While 'Panic Room' is not exactly white-knuckle suspense, it
definitely has its moments, especially the heart-pounding moment when Meg
leaves the panic room to grab her cell phone, and the the tension-building
scene when Whitaker and Yoakam enter the panic room when Foster leaves.  The
only main plot hole is clear in the very beginning: Why would a recently
separated woman with one child want to purchase a four-story brownstone? 
What does she need all of that space for?  Besides that, 'Panic Room' is an
intelligently written and directed thriller from director David Fincher
(Fight Club).  The only characters that don't make sense are Meg's friend in
the opening scenes and her husband (Ann Magnuson and Patrick Bauchau).  They
both seem hopelessly unnecessary; otherwise, 'Panic Room' is a first-rate
thriller with similarities to several shockers of the early 1990s, 'Unlawful
Entry' (1992) being one in particular.  Whitaker has to be one of the nicest
thieves in recent film history!
<|_=00=_|>
I watched part of this film on 'Rogers Pay-TV' after seeing the nifty
trailer on iTunes. About 15 minutes in, I wished I'd spent my $3 on a
really good cup of coffee instead! Then, I started to read the reviews
here at IMDb and realized that I was witnessing a murder in progress--a
murder of the suspense-thriller genre.

Since the camera work and cast are first class, how does one create
such a muddled flick? Simple: the script. High school kids can't really
act, but when they perform 'Oklahoma' or 'Fiddler on the Roof', the
presentation is usually passable. Why? good script.

There is no camera work at a live presentation of one of Shakespeare's
plays, even using unknown but gifted performers - yet the final product
is generally intriguing. Why? good script.

A compelling actor like Hugh Laurie, Anthony Hopkins, Ralph Fiennes, or
{fill in name of your fav American actor here - don't want to hurt your
feelings - you get my point} could sit in a chair and stare at a live
audience, or at a single camera for 2 hours - you'd be spellbound if
they spin a good yarn, but only if they had a good script.

But without a script, even the best actors toil in futility. Forest
Whitaker is always brilliant. Jody Foster has 'A'-list talent. Jared
Leto plays a good 'bizarro-type' (try his understated performance in
'Switchback' with Danny Glover) and Dwight Yoakam has the chops to
'weird you out' in bit roles (made me shudder in 'Sling Blade'). How
could such a roster produce this piece of junk? Bad script. A revealing
clue that the writer tanked the screenplay is when the bad guys show up
and start cursing for no particular reason. The 'script' probably reads
'the bad guys show up and start cursing for no particular reason'.

The array of dumb things in this film, listed here at IMDb, seems
endless, but I'll add one more (apologies if someone got it before):
Jody and daughter are using a flashlight to signal a sleeping neighbor
for help,100 yards away. He wakes up, looks out his window and....
and.....and... they stop flashing the SOS and they begin to holler
'Help Help Help' (through a rainstorm). He can't hear. He goes back to
sleep. Darn it - I hate it when that happens.

Finally - looking for a good cast, nifty camera work, decent
performance, and forgivable minor slips in logic? try 'Red Eye'! the
difference? good script.
<|_=00=_|>

The acting and cinematography in this film are excellent.  (Jodie Foster
and
Forest Whitaker are particularly good.)  But, this is one of those movies
where everyone is SCREAMING at the screen to do some really obvious
things.
(I have included some examples in the "SPOILER" section below.)  I know
that
this film is trying to lure you in and "feeeeeel" Jodie's pain, but when
she
can't even make simple, obvious choices to help herself I can no longer
empathize with her.  I think, "She deserves to be stuck in there, she's
just
too stupid to be out roaming the streets with the rest of us."

Some of the camera shots are incredible and the timing of the movie is
phenomenal.  You do manage to stay at the edge of your seat without a lot
of
TENSE music added to force you there.  Really, the movie is good, but the
plot stinks.

SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!

An example of how STUPID Jodie's character is.  In the trailers for the
film
they show this very creepy scene where the bad guys hold up a sign reading
"What we want is in that room."  Now, does Jodie say "what is it?" or "how
about I put it outside the door, you take it and then leave".  NOPE,
nothing....the film doesn't even address that fact.  Later, it ends up
being
a stupid floor safe containing bonds.  That's another thing, she is in
this
tiny, tiny room making McGuyver-esque use of everything and she doesn't
notice a safe under the area rug???????? 
<|_=00=_|>
Panic Room must be a comedy. It's not supposed to be a comedy. But
because of its silly plot full of holes and ridiculous dialog, it turns
out to be unintentionally funny.

Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam and Jared Leto play a trio of robbers
that makes the Three Stooges look smart. They resemble the hapless
burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in Home Alone. Only this time it's
Jodie Foster and Kristen Stuart who are home alone when the three
goofballs break into their home to steal the millions of dollars hidden
in the Panic Room. That's a vault room that the previous owner had
built into the house. It's so safe that no one can break into it. It
has its own phone and electrical system, its own air filtration system
and surveillance cameras to see every room in the house. And guess who
helped build it. Forest Whitaker, one of the robbers. 

This movie is so dumb. Here are just a few of the many glaring errors:

1. Whitaker is able to pump propane gas into the room, even though it
has its own ventilation system. He does this simply by knocking a hole
in the drywall. The room itself is encased in concrete and steel.

2.He's also tries to tap into a phone cable, which, get this, is
sticking out of a jack in the wall and which, get this, Jodie Foster
manages to, in the nick of time, yank out of the wall even though she
is in the panic room. 

3. The hapless robbers seal the house so that no one can get in or out.
But, who happens to appear? Foster's husband. That's right. He manages
to just appear in the foyer even though they have locked up the house
tight and sealed the doors with screws. 

4. How about the fact that large tools appear from nowhere such as the
drill press which Whitaker uses to drill into the safe. Why would
anyone go to all the trouble to put a safe in a Panic Room yet the safe
is so weak you can drill into it? Beats me. 

5. Foster's daughter who it turns out goes into diabetic coma and needs
an injection. This certainly came out of the blue.

In short, Panic Room is one of the stupidest movies in recent memory.
It is not just stupid, it's incredibly stupid. The dialog is absolutely
so bad it's a hoot. The plot is so full of holes you'll be laughing
your butt off.

Too bad. I love Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker. They have an immense
amount of talent. They should never have been in this total piece of
rubbish.

WARNING **** CONTAINS SPOILERS

When will the critics quit being so polite to David Fincher. I hear he's a
heck of guy, and really swell at parties but this was weak. And how did
anyone give David Koepp $4 mil for this piece of garbage. I've seen this
movie at least a million times and usually on TV for free!!! Don't studio
execs watch movies these days.

First of all, I want to know where the audiences were that were on the edge
of their seats - because that theater needs bigger chairs. The audience I
saw this stinker with didn't make a peep the whole time except for the
occasional groan. 

Forget that the film was boring. Forget that the biggest drama in the whole
movie wasn't about whether anyone was going to get in or out of the panic
room - but rather whether a young girl is going to get her insulin shot -
talk about a cheap plot twist - and the ridiculous sub B-movie twitching
that she was order to do - (when someone is slipping into a coma they don't
flop around like someone in a low rent sci-fi flick) - what the H was the
deal with that ending!!!

SPOILER ****

Am I really supposed to believe that a skinny little dude like Dwight Yokum
- almost has his hand severed in the door - loses about a pint of blood -
then gets hit in the head with a sledgehammer at full force - falls down a
flight of stairs and can still get up and kick Jodi Foster's ass - even
though she hasn't been hurt in the entire film - (everyone else gets beat up
but not her) - Jeez - that's straight out of Jim Bob Briggs-land. And as far
as the twist that Forrest Whittaker comes back and saves the day - well it
might have a little punch if it wasn't so telegraphed in the moments before
he entered the room. I mean I've seen it before - but did Fincher really
have to show him turning his head to hear the noise inside and then hesitate
on the fence!!!!! Lame - lame - lame!!!

People (and I include myself here) we are never going to get decent films if
we keep accepting garbage like this and then defending it because we're told
it comes with a pedigree. This is the same movie we've seen for years.
Whether it's a thriller or a slasher film (and they are really becoming the
same thing at this point) we keep getting B-grade drivel. And we as an
audience keep accepting it. And until we say enough is enough this is what
we will get!

Boycott drivel now.
