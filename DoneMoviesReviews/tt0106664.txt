Somewhere in the dark recesses of over-fluffed and processed Stephen
King movie adaptations, there lies this jewel of a film: "The Dark
Half." 

After having it watched it about three times, I'm still quite at a loss
as to why this movie has been, more or less, forgotten or simply passed
over by the horror movie community. Not only is it a fairly neat
adaptation of a great King novel, but it's also directed and written by
a true horror movie icon: the one and only George Romero. Isn't this
the kind of "team-up" that fans would, under normal circumstances, go
absolutely bananas over? I know that I did.

Anyway ... the movie is about a writer, Thad Beaumont (Timothy Hutton),
whose past - quite literally - comes back to haunt him. As a young man,
he wrote pulpy crime novels (that I can only imagine were directly
inspired by Richard Stark's hardboiled, master thief, Parker) that sold
well ... though his literary yearnings tended to veer toward a much
less marketable direction. We learn that when he was writing those
pulps, his personality suffered. He drank, yelled at his wife, probably
slept around, too. Having successfully exorcised that particular demon,
when we meet him, Beaumont has a couple kids and an office at some New
England university, teaching - you guessed it - creative writing. But
when the bodies of folks close to him (i.e.: his agent, biographer)
begin cropping up, the small-town police fun finger is pointed at
Beaumont. But ... there's a much more sinister twist in this jet-black
yarn. We learn that Beaumont indeed has a "dark half."

The direction is perfect, the writing is perfect, the acting is
perfect. What more do you want in a film? I'm not exactly certain what
King's response was to this film ... I've heard rumors that if he's not
directly involved in the production process, he generally scoffs at the
final film product. (For example ... he's all but urinated on all the
goodness that was Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of "The Shining," which
not only marked a substantial turning point in horror cinema, but it's
also one of my personal favorites.) Then again ... from what I
understand to be true of King and Romero both ... they're friends.
Hell, they made "Creepshow" together ... which is another favorite of
mine, though I'm more than just a little bit guilty about it. 

"The Dark Half" also does one hell of a job at creating a genuinely
creepy atmosphere. And who could listen to "Are You Lonesome Tonight"
again the same way ... after hearing its soft melodies during a
particularly uncomfortable dream sequence?

All of this, compounded with the fact that Timothy Hutton is a damned
fine actor (albeit sinfully unknown by most these days) ... makes "The
Dark Half" an explosively well made horror/thriller. The proverbial
mind meld of King and Romero made "Creepshow" an instant cult classic.
So, I ask again ... why was "The Dark Half" a blink-or-you'll-miss-it
flop? Maybe these horror titans just can't share the same marquee,
anymore.

I dunno.

The Dark Half is one of the finest Stephen King adaptations.  It's also
one
of George Romero's most under-appreciated works.  The two of them have
collaborated on many occasions to produce nothing but good things, but
this
takes it to a new level.  Romero is known for casting unknowns for his
leads.  This time he went against the grain.  He used the amazing Timothy
Hutton.  Hutton, in a dual role, plays both mild-mannered Thad Beaumont
and
mean b*stard George Stark.  But when he's Stark, he really comes to life.
He's both cool and creepy.  The sparrows are also a crucial part of the
overall eeriness of the movie.  Although he will always be known for the
unforgettable Dead trilogy, this may be Romero's finest, most high-brow
picture to date.  The production values are the cleanest I've seen in any
Romero flick, the acting is top-notch, and story is solid.  Getting a
scare
at the theater is fairly easily achieved.  Getting me to jump in the
privacy
of my own home in another thing altogether.  Romero made me jump while
watching the movie on a crappy 19 inch television.and I've seen the movie
before.  That's saying something.  Royal Dano and Michael Rooker
co-star.

The Dark Half is great. Put two of the masters of horror together in a box,
shake Â‘em up, and you get this very entertaining and darkly humorous story.
Can you believe this is the latest film from George Romero? 1993? It's a
crime that this man isn't doing movies on a regular basis anymore. I hear he
has a couple of projects on the horizon, but seven years is just too long,
George! Stephen King movie adaptions can be pretty damn good, or really,
really awful depending on who's behind the camera. Well, no worries here,
King and Romero have had a great working relationship in the past (and I
expect good things in the future). 

But give credit where credit is due, it's Timothy Hutton's outstanding
performance that really makes this film special for me. He's good enough as
ordinary Thad Beaumont, with just a hint of evil underneath his nice husband
and father persona, holding back the nasty as best he can. Then Hutton is
George Stark, and he doesn't even look like the same person. That's why
Hutton is so damn good. With just a few minor changes, slicked-back hair and
some facial stubble, he's a completely different person. You have to see it
to believe it, he's that good. And he delivers the films darkly humorous
lines perfectly ("What's going on out here?", "Murder. Want some?"). I know,
the murderous joker has been done to death, but Hutton's good enough that we
can forgive it. I love, love, love horror movies and this is one of the
reasons why. 8/10 stars. G'night!

Sadly a rather bland version of King's sadly rather bland novel. Romero
had apparently been slated to direct Pet Semetary before commitments
(Monkey Shines) pulled him off - now that would have been worth
watching. This on the other hand is a rather tepid slasher flick
punctuated with a few inspired moments (the dream sequences and the
whole sparrow things in particular). It's hard to know who is a fault
here - certainly Dark Half - despite its intriguing premise - is one of
King's weaker novels - but Romero's screenplay is little more than a
rather one dimensional collection of deaths. There is some suspense and
some good effects but overall a rather dull affair.
<|_=00=_|>
The Dark Half is a very good horror movie which is not surprising
considering the novel was written by Stephen King. George Romero a man
who has done a wonderful job with horror movies is the man in charge of
taking this from a novel to a movie and he delivers.

The plot revolves around author Thad Beaumont. Beaumont had written
several best selling novels under the pseudonym George Stark. However a
law student makes the connection and threatens to reveal it to
everyone. Before this can happen Beaumont goes public and tells
everyone he is Stark, essentially killing off his pseudonym. Stark
isn't content with being dispatched and he comes to life determined to
stick around. Stark then goes around killing those responsible for his
demise. Beaumont must fight Stark because only one of them can survive.

Timothy Hutton does a spectacular job as both Beaumont and Stark. He
really makes you believe the two are separate people but are tied
together. The plot is suspenseful and full of unexpected twists. There
are also supernatural elements such as the sparrows or bringers of the
living dead.

So to sum it up The Dark Half is one of the better adoptions to Stephen
King's works. It follows the story accurately and succeeds in scaring
the audience which is the aim for horror movies.

In Castle Rock, Maine, the respectable writer and professor Thad
Beaumont (Timothy Hutton) lives a comfortable life with his wife Liz
Beaumont (Amy Madigan) and his two babies. Out of the blue, he is
blackmailed by a punk from New York that has discovered a hidden secret
about Thad: before writing serious novels, he had written cheap
literature using the pseudonym of George Stark and has become a
successful writer of the genre and made enough money to raise his
family. 

Thad and Liz discuss the situation and Thad calls his editors telling
that he would tell the truth about George Stark to the press. The
editors like the idea and prepare a promotional event, with That
Beaumont burying George Stark in the cemetery. When the photographer is
murdered, Sheriff Alan Pangborn (Michael Rooker) comes to Thad's home
and tells that he is the prime suspect of the crime. Thad believes that
the blackmailer is the responsible for the death but soon he finds that
the man was murdered. Soon there are a crime spree incriminating Thad
and he claims that George Stark is the responsible for the bloodshed.
How can his violent alter ego be responsible for the homicides?

"The Dark Half" is a horror movie with a promising story by Stephen
King but unfortunately with a disappointing conclusion with the
sparrows destroying George Stark and leaving Thad Beaumont without any
evidence to prove his innocence. The explanation of Reggie that George
Stark is a conjuration, an entity created by dark half of Thad that
brought his alter ego to life, is weak. I saw this movie for the first
time in the 90's on VHS and I have just watched again on DVD. My vote
is six.

Title (Brazil): "A Metade Negra" ("The Dark Half")

I saw this movie after i read the book and i have to say pretty much of
the
book was also in the film, although not all. Some parts with the sparrows
for instance weren't in the film, probably because the budget wouldn't
allow
special effects that elaborate. And the murders, although violent enough
in
the movie, were particularly more gruesome in the book.

Ultimate conclusion: great acting from top notch actors/actresses who
usually are nowhere to be found in horror (if you discount Michael
Rooker's
performance in "Henry"), pretty good special f/x and direction from a
director who has made his mark in horror.

George Romero didn't translate King's book to the letter when he made
this screenplay; perhaps for the better because his version is an
equally interesting take.

Starring Timothy Hutton as a famous pulp novelist writing under the
name of George Stark, the main character works; Thad Beaumont is
clumsy, intelligent and quite the family man. Married to Amy Madigan
and a father of twins.

When someone threatens to expose Thad for the pulp writer he is,
Beaumont decides to let the world know he is George Stark. Good call
you'd think, but George disagrees.

Thad's friends and family become the target of a guy going by the name
of "George Stark". Like the characters in the books he has a taste for
underground killings and a flair for rock 'n' roll one liners.

As the killings continue, Thad becomes entangled in an investigation
directed at him.

This material is at fist glance unknown territory for George Romero,
having spend too much time writing dialogue for zombie victims. Sure,
Martin and Monkey Shines were proof the man could write a good script,
but "the dark half" is as clever in its writing as it is to the point.

Add to that a wonderful score by Christopher Young (you haven't lived
until you've heard the main theme, reprized at full glory in the end
credits) The American DVD is full screen, the European (UK) has the
widescreen, so avoid that US edition.

Dark Half is an inventive thriller that relies very much on the steps
of belief (it builds the fiction, which few horror films do).

This is one of the few horror movies in which I was truly frightened.
Unlike
most horror movies these days, this one was serious from beginning to end.
I
saw this movie before I read the book and knew very little about it. I was
on the edge of my seat all night. Timothy Hutton is wonderful as the evil
George Stark and the good Thad Beaumont. Amy Madigan was good as his
confused wife, too. This movie is a wonderful adaptation of the Stephen
King
book. Very little is left out. If you haven't seen this movie, which many
people have not, you should rent it. I give it a ten out of
ten.

Thad Beaumont (Timothy Hutton) had a brain tumor as a child that was an
undeveloped twin. Now, as an adult, the twin returns, fully formed and
violent. The source is a bit supernatural, but real enough to kill.

The story goes over ground that should be familiar to Stephen King
fans. The idea of a child growing up to confront something from his
childhood. The theme of a writer, explored numerous times ("Misery",
"The Shining") but most closely to this in "Secret Window". Howard
Maxford calls it a cross between "Misery" and "The Birds", which I do
not fully accept but see his point.

Interestingly, Stephen King is not known for good movie adaptations,
and George Romero has had his slew of below average films (though, if
you stray from his zombie films, you will find an assortment of
goodies). But together, they seem to have made a decent movie here. I
really enjoyed it. I also enjoyed "Creepshow" -- maybe these guys bring
out the best in each other? Michael Rooker is here (with hair) playing
the role played by Ed Harris in "Needful Things". I would have liked to
see some consistency in casting, but how do you choose between Rooker
and Harris? Both top notch. Another Harris, Julie Harris, does appear,
though... And the music is from Christopher Young, perhaps best known
for his "Hellraiser" score.

Some of the factual information I found to be a bit questionable. Does
a military service record really go into an FBI fingerprint database? I
suppose it might, but the idea struck me as odd. And the idea that one
in ten people start off as twins seemed too exaggerated (and then they
said that was at the very least). I would like to know the truth on
that.

Overall, though, a really decent film. It is not Oscar or Golden Globe
material by any means, but a horror fan should enjoy the mix of gore
and dark humor. Rue Morgue has called it "a middling Romero film based
on a middling King novel", which really sells it short.

Unfortunately, the film did not get the proper respect in 1993, because
its distributor (Orion) was fighting a bankruptcy battle and promoted
it poorly. But now (2015), it has a second chance thanks to the fine
folks at Scream Factory who have loaded up the Blu-ray with everything
possible, including the kitchen sink.
