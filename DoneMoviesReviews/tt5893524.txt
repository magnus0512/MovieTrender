This "comedy" is dry and boring, hardly anyone laughs at this movie.
The main character Michelle Chong repeats her silly act (a dance)
throughout the entire show. She's like a one trick pony. There's hardly
any character development in this movie, and majority of the acting is
plainly bad. The plot is shallow and meaningless. Which fails to tug
the heart strings nor tickle the audience. Furthermore, this movie
tried too hard to shove down product placement down the audience's
throat, that I felt like I was watching a badly crafted commercial. It
was painful to watch, and I felt like I throw good money & time down
the drain.
