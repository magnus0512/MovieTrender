I had to add a comment to this page because I couldn't believe that it
only had a 4. something rating. I believe it deserves something much
higher. I first saw this film about 15 years ago now, and ever since it
has become one of my all time favorites. The comedy to the acting to
the soundtrack all truly represent the best of 80's comedy film making.
Either you love 80's films or you hate them. My husband hates them,
which makes me wonder sometimes how I could've married a man that
stands against everything I love about movies. The two Barry's are the
best. "Barry - Barry... I scored"! I think I have watched this move
about 50 times in my life and that is no exaggeration. I will watch it
anytime its on. Jimmy Cliff delivers a soundtrack like no other. Every
song could'va made one of his albums without anyone knowing it was
Scored for a film. In fact I wish I could find where to buy the
soundtrack as I have looked for years and have never been able to find
it. Brian Doyle Murray is also hilarious in this film. Maybe it has to
do with my childhood and experimenting with Reggae, and Drugs that made
me fall in love with this film, but as I said it will always be one of
my favorites and I hope everyone that loves 80's films gets to see this
at least once.

You'll either fall in love with this film or you won't.

The story of an injured fireman who goes to the tropics and becomes
involved with a hotel, Twiggy and local politics is a film played
strictly for laughs. The humor is very broad and often not very clever
but if you can go with its good natured attitude you'll have a good
time.

The cast of Robin Williams, Jimmy Cliff, Twiggy and several escapees
from SCTV is up to the task of being Silly. Peter O'Toole is even
better than the rest as the world weary British Envoy to the island who
wants nothing more than to be allowed to drink.

For me this film is a perfect ten on the enjoyment scale. For everyone
else I think you'll find it around a seven or eight.

Many comedies require their own set of rating considerations. Club
Paradise is one of those. This slips into the "guilty of mindless fun"
category. The movie does not stand on a strong story. The charm is in
its Carribbean setting, the mostly reggae soundtrack, Jimmy Cliff's
character and Robin Williams' character--while we're at it throw Peter
O'toole in their too. Charm, charm, charm. The writing is borderline
offensive, that is, if you watch the film with a highly critical mind.
One might complain that dangerously negative stereotypes abound in this
film. Maybe they do. My suggestion is to enjoy the popcorn and let the
laughter roll. You can feel guilty later. Fun stuff.

Before Robin Williams solidly established himself as a star in "Good
Morning, Vietnam", he starred in several innocuously silly movies such
as "Club Paradise". He plays Jack Moniker, a Chicago firefighter who
retires and moves to the Caribbean island of St. Nicholas. There, he
joins up with tour guide Ernest Reed (Jimmy Cliff) and the two of them
open a wild business, with the help of Gov. Anthony Cloyden Hayes
(Peter O'Toole). Once the rich American tourists start arriving, the
high finks take off.

The movie is mostly an excuse for a bunch of goofy things to happen,
especially when the characters played by Eugene Levy and Rick Moranis
embarrass themselves. True, Williams did better with some of his later
work, but "Club Paradise" is still pretty funny.
<|_=00=_|>

Ramis has exceptional talent.  The eclectic selection of humorous scenes is
well woven.

O'Toole lends a great deal of sophistication to the film.  His thought
provoking words on government and island life stirred my
imagination.

Williams seems to have been at his comical best early in his career.

Moranis proves himself to be a true oddball.

Certainly, this is a picture you should not miss seeing.

I guess I'm an '80's boy because I have so much to remember, high
school graduation, college, Navy service etc. etc. Yet it is the movies
I remember the most and this is one of them.

It is cute and fun and with some great actors playing, so what if it
didn't win any Oscars? Sure it wasn't gut bursting laughs by the
minute, rather smiling all through the movie.

No. It is all about the beautiful warm feeling you get, like coming
directly from the Caribbean sun itself. Laid back, cool music and a
good time.

Pour yourself a drink (Bacardi perhaps?) watch it on a rainy winter
evening with some company and you'll have a great time especially if
you can remember yourself when you watched it for the first time.

Some hokey gags, but lot's of hilarious banter from Robin Williams and
Peter
O'Toole, plus epic songs from Jimmy Cliff and others.  Lot's of great
performances in smaller roles by Brian Doyle-Murray, Rick Moranis, Twiggy
and Jimmy Cliff.

This Movie has to be one of the more underated movies out
there.
Robin Williams is at his best  Club Paradise is full of great
Jamaican music, buetiful scenery and is full of comedy. It is
a
must see for tropical vacation lovers.

This is one of my favorite movies with Robin Williams. Normally, he is
so out of control, it's difficult to watch him. This time, he steps
back a little and lets the other funny people take a turn. Peter
O'Toole stole the picture, as far as I'm concerned, with his droll
delivery. Even Twiggy was a pleasant surprise. Loved the Jimmy Clift
music, and the Adolph Cesear as the blustery military leader. The two
Barrys (Moranis and Levy) had some of the best lines as they tried to
score some marijuana. And I'll never pronounce White the same way after
Andrea Martin gave it her own special twist. This is a great movie to
watch in the dead of winter. It will warm you right up.

This is a very enjoyable film, even if it doesn't always deliver the
gut-laughs that you might expect. While I can only give it a six or a
seven,
I always think of it with a smile; it's definitely just as funny or
funnier
than the average comedy coming out today.

Part of my affinity for this movie is the cast. Robin Williams, as you
would
only expect, is his manic self here, a fish-out-of-water ex-Chicago
fireman,
struggling to open a low rent tourist resort in a banana republic. He's
got
some funny bits, and his throwaway ad lib's are better than most other
actors' scripted lines.

The real bonus, though, is the rest of the cast. Jimmy Cliff, the
original
reggae superstar, stars as Williams'musician business partner (how's
_that_
for authenticity?). Peter O'Toole swills drinks and purses his lips
around
his extra long cigarette holder,while spitting out his cynical, glib
observations regarding the tropical paradise/hellhole.

But some of the funniest moments here are provided by several veterans of
SCTV. Andrea Martin plays a pampered wife, most definitely out of her
element in Williams' accomodations, while Rick Moranis and Eugene Levy
are
hilarious playing two slaughterhouse workers trying to score, in more
ways
than one. Some of the drug humor connected with their characters is every
bit as funny as anything Cheech & Chong attempted.

Additionally, Brian Doyle-Murray, Twiggy, and Adolph Caesar round out a
very
busy cast. The story moves along quickly, the music is great, and the
whole
thing makes a great accompaniment for your favorite bag of microwave
popcorn.

6-7 stars.
