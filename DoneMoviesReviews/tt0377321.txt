While watching the movie, if you did not know who the director was or
if you missed the title credits of the movie, I bet you would have
considered this a Mani Ratnam product. After having given movies like
Keladi Kanmani, Aasai, Nerukku Ner, Appu and Rhythm, I wonder what more
Vasanth needs to do to gain recognition. Undoubtedly, he is one of the
few very best directors Tamil Cinema has ever produced. The subjects
that he touches upon are so thematic and meaningful to the society. He
is such a gem and yet not a single national honour for him? National
honour is a different issue. At least, he must be recognised in Tamil
Cinema. When people name the best directors of Tamil cinema, the names
that come out are K.Balachander, Mani Ratnam, Bharathi raja, Balu
Mahendra. Vasanth is easily in their league with such high quality film
making to his credit.

Oh, as for the movie, this is seriously a must watch. This movie was
actually a flop at the box office which goes to show the kind of dumb
audience we have for Tamil Cinema. Only uncouth people will not like
this movie!

A must watch classic! 9.4/10
