 In film school it is not cool to say you like David Lynch. Film students
claim he is just a poor mans version of Luis Bunuel. Yes, I would say that
Bunuel is more talented and is the king of surrealism. But Lynch is very
good and his films do challenge the viewer. I actually have a deep affection
for his films. When his films work, they really work! However, when they do
not work, for example, Twin Peaks, Fire, Walk with Me or Lost Highway then
they quickly launch themselves into self parody. Many people claim his
material is too inconsistent and indulgent to be really liked very much.

 
 What I find strange is that one reviewer here states that he feel duped by
Lynch. Duped? Why? The films all have a story. They just have a narrative
that works differently to conventional film making. If you look hard at the
film and try to understand the subtext then you will pick up  on what the
film is about.

 I saw this when I was 16. I knew nothing about films or film making then. A
friend and I were bored so we decided to see a movie at capitol cinema.
Capitol cinema used to be a cinema that played arty or small independent
films. They used to play midnight showings of eraserhead. There was always
someone smoking a joint in that place. However, you don't need drugs for
this film. Lynch is drugs. This film just buzzes you out.

 I had no idea what Eraserhead was about. I had never heard of Lynch and
knew nothing about surrealism. I went in and was just totally blown away!
Before this I had only really seen commercial blockbuster movies. Lynch gave
me a whole knew perspective on what cinema is capable of. Eraserhead is the
stuff of dreams. Lynch believes that watching a film is entering a dream
state. Both my friend and I did not know what the hell was going on. I was
fascinated...   

 Later I would learn this is a film about Lynch's own obsessions. His hatred
of Philadelphia. His fear and anxiety at being a father. The film is just
full of a kind of a compulsive, paranoid neurosis. It is a waking nightmare.
He also seems to parody the nuclear family. 'Did you have sexual intercourse
with my daughter?' Meanwhile that weird blond woman in his radiator seems to
represent his escape. A way to transcend from his grim world. What I also
find bizarre is that people then accuse him of having no sense of humor!
What? There are always funny moments in his films. 'Did you have sexual
intercourse with my daughter?'

Jack Nance is also very good as the main character. He seems to be playing
the director and he gives a performance that is distant, spaced out and yet
emotionally vulnerable. A really strange mix.
 
The imagery is just brilliant. Black and white in an industrial wasteland.
There is smoke here of course. It wouid not be a Lynch film without smoke! 
It also has a cool, grating industrial soundtrack that sets your nerves on
edge. This is perfectly effective for the bleak tone of the film. It is so
visually striking that the viewer will not forget the imagery quickly. There
is a reason that this is a cult film. The other distinctive feature of this
film is the long lingering shots. This reminds me of Jim Jarmusch and his
movies like Dead Man and Ghost Dog. The length of the shots seems to have
the effect of immersing the viewer in this strange industrial
wasteland.

I have my own copy that I lend to friends. They then normally give it back
to me saying that they only got through the first half hour. They also
normally tell me that I am a weirdo for liking it. I think what frustrates
people most about Lynch is that he will not give any explanations of what
the film is about. So any interpretation is as good as any other. People
want the film to be explained so they can understand it. Who said films must
be understood or comprehensible? Why can't a film be abstract piece of art
like a painting? Lynch's films are like an acid trip. To quote the great
gonzo, Hunter S Thompson, 'buy the ticket, take the ride and if it gets a
little heavier than what you  had in mind, then put it down to forced
consciousness expansion.' 

 So in other words, relax, stick it on and just run with it. Travel into
someone else's nightmare for a change...

I sometimes dream of waking to a completely dark world, a world with no
sunlight and minimal artificial light. My vision is blurred, but there
is nothing to see. The streets are virtually empty, and my friends and
family are lifeless; sitting, standing or even walking, but with
nothing to do or say, and nowhere to go. No questions are asked because
there is nothing to learn, nothing is discussed because nothing is
interesting. And it is this dismal reality I am faced with, only
partially aware that there is anything better.

The existence I dream of is somewhat reminiscent of the world of Henry
Spencer, the main character in Eraserhead, who becomes father to a
hideously deformed baby. That's what the film is about at face value,
but the very style in which it is portrayed is the real beauty of it.
The setting and scenery makes the film one of the most desperately
depressing I have ever seen. And although Henry seems to be devoid of
any spark of personality, we can't help but sympathise with him
throughout the film.

Similar to my dream, the only form of light is artificial, the streets
are virtually empty, and the only person in the entire film who has any
personality is the father-in-law, and the only thing he has to talk
about is his poor health. He also seems to be the only one with any
link to better times. ("I've watched this city turn from pastures to
the hell-hole it is now.") The city they live in is completely
industrialized, and the only plant life seen is dead, and in a pile of
soil on Henry's bedside table.

Some have suggested it is based after a nuclear holocaust, but nothing
is explained to any conclusion. One of the beauties of this film is
that it practically begs the viewer to decide for themselves what any
of it means, and there are many theories. I warn you not to read the
message board of Eraserhead before you see the film, as it is so much
more powerful and chilling to experience it first-hand.

The first time I saw Eraserhead, I was completely confused. It is
possible that David Lynch just put a load of random imagery together
and called it a film. Maybe he wanted the viewers to put it all
together and make their own sense of it (or not). On the other hand,
there might actually be a set formula behind it and only the very
open-minded and discerning audience can properly decipher it.

One viewing of Eraserhead is enough to raise about a dozen questions,
and to leave you gasping for answers. Two viewings are probably enough
to give you theories about some of the cryptic depictions hauntingly
portrayed. Three viewings might be enough to give you a completely
different set of theories, battling persistently against your previous
conceptions, but still leaving just a few details that don't quite seem
to fit in. The truth is that there may be parts that don't make sense
in one interpretation, but fit in perfectly to another. You could
probably watch Eraserhead several times, and each time see a slightly
different story. Or if you were to ask six different people exactly
what Eraserhead is about, you would get six different answers, each
equally correct in their own right, and each equally confused.

That being said, this definitely isn't a film for everyone. This is the
first Lynch film I have seen, and it certainly won't be the last. But
there will no doubt be many who see this purely as a lot of clever mind
tricks and special effects (for its time, anyway.) There will be those
who don't like much to think about, and want it all explained bit by
bit in perfect detail. Well, Eraserhead is an epitome of everything
such moviegoers will hate. I will say this for certain: If your
favourite films are 'Love Actually' or 'Dude, Where's My Car?', you
probably won't get much out of Eraserhead. But for those who like their
concepts challenged once in a while, this film will probably be one to
watch again and again until you understand. This is also not a film to
be forgotten easily. Love it or hate it, Eraserhead will stay with you
for a very long time.
<|_=00=_|>

I can think of very few films that have sound as their most commendable
feature. The Exorcist is one, a film that, aside from infrequent strains of
`Tubular Bells', adopts minimal incidental music. This is laudable in a
horror genre where shocks are clearly signposted  and predicted  by
overgenerous musical stings. The Exorcist may be flawed, but its avoidance
of this field cliché is worthy of praise.

Eraserhead is the other film that excels in sound. A frankly disturbing
concoction of industrial score and white noise with undercurrents of musical
hall and sonorous church organ, it is almost an extra character in the film,
and easily it's most prominent factor. 

Yet Eraserhead is to be recommended for more than its incidentals. An
impenetrable and gloomy work, what is it actually about? Who is the credited
`man in the planet' who pulls levers that control giant spermatozoa? Many
questions like this permeate a film which perhaps has to be seen several
times to get over the initial shock of it's avant gardism. Lynch extracts
the everyday and supplants it with the exceptionally bizarre. The experience
of meeting a girlfriend's parents for the first time is never worse than
here, where the parents in question gyrate spasmodically to the animated
legs of a blood-spitting chicken. It's these scenes  along with the
deformed mutant baby  that could lend the film the air of an abortion
debate. Birth and repressed sexuality thrive throughout the film, from
suckling puppies to the seductive appeal of the `beautiful girl across the
hall' and a mother-in-law that gets too close for comfort. I guess the
entire film could be a man's mental breakdown when faced with the premature
responsibilities of marriage and fatherhood. Though to be honest I couldn't
even begin to imagine what it's really all about.

Encroaching blackness fills every scene, where lights are intermittent at
best, and at worse fail completely. Often sets  particularly the bedroom
when `Mary X' is feeding the child  are like prison cells. Two of the most
eerie segments involve a title-explaining dream (?) where Henry's (Nance's)
head is carved into pencil rubbers and an unsettling musical number from the
`lady in the radiator'. This is the same lady with two candyfloss-like lumps
on her cheeks that alternates her stage appearances between stamping on
giant sperm to singing with religious convictions.

Direction and cinematography are brilliant throughout, though the climax is
the ultimate extension of a film that borders on darker, extremely
unpleasant aspects of reality. I took a girl to see this film once, where
the conclusion formed the final straw in what could be seen as a cycle of
repellent imagery. I wonder why I never saw her again?

<|_=00=_|>

I've watched Eraserhead countless times. In theaters. Off of the
infamous Japanese-subtitled VCR copy. Off of the recent Lynch
re-release. From around the late 70s onward. Yes, that long.

I have friends who won't let me recommend movies to them any more.

Anyway, the capsule summary, "Can't be summarized," is pretty close.

First, it is not a movie. It is not a film.

It is a piece of art.

All of the comments I read that attempt to describe it as a movie fail
for precisely that reason. If you read the ones that can handle it,
they handle it as an art review.

So don't even think of it as a movie. Don't recommend it as a movie. It
doesn't work.

I'll also admit that I sat in a haze for decades, absorbed in the
imagery. In awe of the impressions. And finally, an image crystallized,
an image of what this was a portrait of. (And, of course, I expect this
image may change with repeated viewings...) And as I watch it, with
this in mind, a continuity appears.

We are living in hell, we just don't realize it.

<|_=00=_|>
I'm always a bit worried when I'm about to express my love towards this
movie by the genius director David Lynch... I figure it's the perfect
indicator for psychiatrists to claim that you're completely nuts :) 

But what the heck, they're a lot of nutballs on this website, so I can
speak my mind freely. Indeed, I love this movie...although 'love' may
be a wrong term to describe my feelings towards it. This movie
'fascinates' me is a much better saying. Usually, a movie is something
in which you can live yourself in...in order to escape the stress of
real life. Eraserhead is the exact opposite of that ! When watching
this film, you can only hope that you'll never awake in the wold like
Lynch shows it here. The horrible noises, the colorless and tasteless
locations and the insensible characters...you all hate to love it.
Eraserhead takes a walk with your emotions, you don't know whether to
be disgusted or intrigued by it. So you'll feel uncomfortable when
watching it and that's a wonderful experience for a cinema freak !

Eraserhead is the ultimate cult film in my opinion and a must see for
every fan of this delicious genre. In fact, I would go so far to say
you can't call yourself a cult-freak if you haven't seen it yet.

David Lynch begins his highly impressive career with this one and it
still lives on. Eraserhead isn't his best film at all ( certainly not
when it comes to storyline ) but it's his most deep and personal tale.
25 years old and still the "weirdest" film ever. That's an achievement,
certainly with all this artistic filmmakers lately...or, at least, they
try to be...)

I want to encourage as much people as possible to see this one, but
it's for the best that some groups of people avoid it. Surely not
recommended if you're depressed or suicidal...The image of Jack Nance
and the rest of the cast could even put you more down, I think. The
tagline of this movie - "In heaven, everything looks fine" - could
become a stimulus, I'm afraid. Pregnant women and young couples in love
should beware as well !! This film is the ultimate nightmare for that
what should be the greatest miracle of life...The hideous but yet
harmless "baby" ( I really don't know how I should call it, actually
)is the purest form of horror that ever occurred on the screen.

You must have respect for director David Lynch. If you imagine how hard
it must have been to create and finance this production. But it
worked...hell, even comedy legend Mel Brooks was deeply impressed.
Based on this film, he decided to let Lynch direct "The Elephant Man" a
few years later. By that, David's career was launched and of course he
made a masterpiece out of it. For me personally, his highlights were
the 80's with terrific movies like "Blue Velvet", "Dune" ( very
underrated, in my opinion) and "Wild at Heart" at the end of the
decade. And let's not forget the best TV-series ever made: "Twin
Peaks".

Please, watch this movie !! Three times in a row if possible. I know a
lot of people who just stopped watching it after half and hour ( or
less ) and yelled "What the f*** is this ???". Real shame, if you ask
me. It's an insight to a great mind and a unique event. If you really
don't see the magic of it, at least try to admire the very stylish
haircut of the main character. I'm thinking of doing the same thing
with mine...
<|_=00=_|>
How frightening. How unnerving. What a spectacular piece of
film-making. I saw the film for the first time with a tiresome former
colleague who kept turning to me and whispering : "Please exhale" "Are
you breathing?" "Please breathe" or "Please stop breathing" I wanted to
run away but I couldn't I was glued, stacked, hooked. The world of
David Lynch is made of kindly horrors, normal monsters, poetic
nightmares. I wonder what planet is he from. I think it would important
to know so we can all avoid it. That's what any average Joe may say
because every average Joe, me included, finds something familiar in
this fascinating, peculiar, horrifying vision of the world. You want to
close your eyes, but you can't. Even if you could, you still can hear.
the whimpering of the thing, the child, the figment of David Lynch's
imagination. How can you recommend a nightmare to a friend? Well you
must, if friendship involves sharing every possible experience.
"Earserhead" will put you to the test in a way no other film has ever
done. Go! I dare you.
<|_=00=_|>

First of all, let me say that Eraserhead is not a film for everyone.  Many
people will find themselves confused by the strange atmosphere, surreal
imagery, and signature David Lynch sense of purposefully awkward
pacing.

That out of the way, I would have to say that this is possibly one of my
most personal favorite films.  It is dark, tense, atmospheric, and filled
with sounds and images that will send chills up your spine.  It is a film
that takes more than one viewing to truly begin to comprehend, but is
quite
a ride nontheless.  There are moments in this movie that will literally
scare you, so much so that one could almost call this eerie surreal
art-film
a deconstructed domestic horror movie.  This film, along with the original
black and white Night of the Living dead, are two of the only films in
existance that still scare me to this day.
(Side note: Also, I reccomend that you see Luis Bunuel's movie "Un Chien
Andalou" to see where strange art-films like this originated
from.)

Anyway, the film's plot while initially incomprehensible to most, can be
broken down into the tragic tale of a man named Henry Spencer (Jack Nance)
stuck in a dark decaying city overrun by industry.  During the film, he is
forced to deal with the prospect of taking care of an illegitimate
premature
child birthed by his girlfriend, Mary X. (Charlotte Stewart)  However, he
is
consumed by his guilt, and begins to comprehend suicide as a way out.  But
the story is told through such a swirling mixture of dreamlike imagery
that
this is not always readily apparent.

However, in order to better understand and appreciate the film, one must
figure out what each of the images mean.  Here's a short cliff notes
guidline to some of the more common recurring images in the
movie:

***THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERS***

Worm = sin.
These creatures appear all throughout the movie.  Henry even tries to hide
his "little" sin from Mary at one point, only to have a nightmare where
Mary
is consumed by worms.  Henry's room is also filled with piles dirt and
dead
plants as one might notice, which makes his room a breeding ground for
worms.

The Baby = The product of sin.
You might have noticed that the baby looks an awful lot like a worm.
Futhermore, the baby is a part of Henry, and later during the dream
sequence, we discover that Henry IS the baby.  When Henry kills the baby,
he
kills himself.

Eraser = Memories.
Henry feels that his memories, or his brain with his bad memories, is like
an eraser that needs to be rubbed out.  In his dream sequence, he sees
himself losing his head, and having his brains turned into eraser bits to
be
rubbed out and blown into dust on the wind.

The lady in the radiator = Death.
Death looks grotesque, yet strangely appealing to poor Henry.  The
radiator
gives off warmth and seems to become a stage where death performs for
Henry,
promising to stamp out his sins (worms) and telling him that "in heaven,
everything is fine."  At the end of the movie, Henry embraces the lady in
the radiator before blackness falls.

The man in the planet = God.
In addition to disposing of Henry's cofessed sins at the beginning of the
movie (the worm coming out of Henry's mouth) the scarred man in the planet
appears to prevent Henry from opting for suicide during his dream
sequence.
He silently reminds Henry of his sacrifice (the bleeding tree) though it
is
in vain as Henry shows God what he really is underneith.  (the
baby)

The last is a theme that occurs in all Lynch movies:

Electricity and electrical lighting = The presence of good.
Darkness = The presence of evil.

There are other aspects of the film that keep popping up, such as the
reocurrence of the unlucky number thirteen.  Henry waits thirteen seconds
for the elevator to open up, the lady across the hall takes thirteen
seconds
to appear, Henry's apartment numbers add up to the number thriteen, etc.
Also, there are many other images which I will let you figure out on your
own.

***END OF SPOILERS***

All in all, the movie is quite an experience.  This is a film that you
will
either love or utterly hate.  For myself, I managed to "click" with the
movie from the first time I saw it and have enjoyed it since.  Repeated
viewings only add to the enjoyment of the film, as you begin to notice
more
and more that you never saw before.  All in all, I say that it is an
excellent and extremely layered film.

With that, I give you some fun facts about the movie:

-The pencil eraser machine actually worked.  It was put together by Lynch
and a friend of his.

-To this day, Lynch will still not disclose how he constructed the
amazingly
convincing baby creature, though he claims is was created with
substance/objects that anyone could find around the house.

-Jack Nance's hair was incredibly malleable.  Literally, all it took was a
little bit of trimming on either side of his head and some combing to get
it
to stand upright.

-In order to get a better sense of textures for the film (possibly for the
organs of the baby) Lynch dissected a dead cat.

-When driving around town with the "Henry hair" Jack Nance would sit in
the
center seat while Lynch and someone else would sit on either side to keep
his gravity-defying hair from being seen.
<|_=00=_|>

Let's say it right here and now: David Lynch is a genius.  I don't care if
you love him or hate him, you can't take away that simple fact.
"Eraserhead" is his masterpiece -- the most original and personal film
ever
created by any film maker.  It's as far from the forgettable fluff of
mainstream Hollywood as you can get, and as weird as it is, it strikes a
chord deep in the human psyche. I don't think anyone could experience this
film without being deeply moved. This beautiful, industrial nightmare
comes
as close to depicting a fever dream as any film ever could, or ever will!
David Lynch pulled out all the stops to make "Eraserhead" as perfect as
any
film can be, and it shows. It is a great work of art in its own right. The
characters and setting are unforgettable, and are as strange as they are
familiar.  The story is slow-moving, but steadily builds with the fury of
a
small hurricane. The film walks a tightrope somewhere between the reality
of
the world we know, and "someplace else."  Where that is, only David Lynch
knows for sure.  Lynch is a fine example of a film maker who isn't afraid
to
take huge risks. That's how masterpieces are made.  "Eraserhead" is the
proof.
<|_=00=_|>

You have to dissect it, watch it more than once, eat, breathe it and live it
before you can get it. There are lots of explanations for all of the things
that "make no sense"... it's art in it's purest form - you take away from it
what you want! You can see Henry struggling with suddenly being thrust into
the role of father and husband, his sin, his temptation, his life, his death,
his dreams... too much symbolism to even get into here... anyone who
dismisses this film as "junk that makes no sense" will never get it, and
that's OK. But for the rest of us, it's on our "Top Ten Films of All Time"
list. Brilliant and beautiful and horrifying! Makes you think for weeks...
YEARS. I love it. Highly recommended to those who are open-minded! AMAZING
FILM!!
<|_=00=_|>
When on the hunt for cult films, this one should not be overlooked.
Filmed over the course of five years (1972-1977), this film is the very
first full-length masterpiece of artist David Lynch. I say artist
because he began not as a director, but an art student. Finding canvas
too confining, he moved on celluloid, eventually moving on to AFI to
fund his script 'Eraserhead'. According to Lynch, the film was inspired
largely by his stay in Philadelphia. To know how he views it, the film
must be seen.

The script itself was only 21 pages long, so it was assumed to be
roughly a 21 minute movie; most people wouldn't expect that the film
would be a living, breathing piece of art.

The elements of the film cannot even be understood by film scholars.
Lynch himself has said that in the 25 or more years it has been out
that no critic or viewer has given an interpretation that is in line
with his own. There appear to be prevalent themes of sexuality and
conception, not to mention claustrophobia and physical discomfort in
simply living. The film is definitely very affecting on a visceral
level in certain scenes where Lynch appears to deconstruct the
simplicity of family life and bring to the surface the inherent
disgusting nature of feeding. Near the end, simple curiosity gets the
best of the main character, played extraordinarily well-reserved by
Jack Nance, and his mistake ends up causing his world to fall apart.
Overall, the film logic seems to be one of a nightmare, an open-ended
metaphor dealing with one man's fear of fatherhood.

Put simply, there is no other film like it. Not even Lynch's later work
can compare. This is on the must-see list for any film student,
however, it may be annoying and make absolutely no sense to the casual
viewer.
