One would love to have heard the story planning sessions for this
abysmal third film that pretty much put the final nail in the series
coffin before a lackluster attempt to revive it with another ill-fated
fourth film. Ridley Scott's original was a simple And Then There Were
None haunted house feature set in outer space, but filled with
jaw-dropping class and style that made it stand out from the pack of a
number of worthless imitators. James Cameron's sequel was a virtual
text book on how a sequel should be made in that it upped the ante both
action-wise and emotionally by expanding the Sigourney Weaver
character, getting the audience firmly on her side and giving her a
compelling relationship with a daughter figure. If the first film was
an homage to a haunted house film, then the sequel is a rip-roaring
homage to war films.

By contrast, it is difficult to figure what the goal of David Fincher's
atrocious sequel is aiming for. It does not up the ante action-wise nor
does it expand the characters from the prior films. In fact, Fincher's
audience-hating mess offs two of the major characters from the prior
film in the opening moments and sidelines another - apparently because
of lack of imagination. We then discover relatively early in the
proceedings that the leading lady is living on borrowed time, which all
but eliminates any rooting interest in the film. While creatively
Fincher has license to eliminate audience favorites from the prior
films, he cannot jettison them with so little respect and then not
replace them with characters at least as interesting without it seeming
like a slap in the face, but that is exactly what he does. The denizens
of the prison asteroid where the doomed heroine and her ill-fated crew
crash in the opening moments is populated by an interchangeable melange
of nobodies who blur together.

The storyline, such as it is, conspires a dubious and illogical
scenario of how an alien could have accompanied our heroine and then
propagated itself on the asteroid. Rather than an army of aliens (a la
Cameron), Fincher ratchets it back so far that we instead get one
modest-sized alien that is far less intriguing or frightening than the
one found in Ridley Scott's original. Action-wise we get badly
directed, murky-looking scenes of frantic bald men running down
hallways. The alien moves at the speed of sound (almost like a Benny
Hill sped-up sketch) so that it would be impossible to elude it, yet a
number of characters illogically seem able to outrun it.

Fincher makes it clear from the start that he is far less interested in
action or character development, but merely wishes to hang his own
bizarre stabs at style onto an unwieldy framework - and stylistically
he is no Ridley Scott or even a James Cameron. Why Weaver, who no doubt
could have negotiated for a better story, would have returned and
participated in this pap is indefensible. Even worse, why 20th Century
Fox did not just end a promising sci-fi saga on a brilliant note and
instead chose to have it interred and vivisected by hacks is equally
unknowable. As it is, we have the perfect example of Class 101 on how
NOT to make a sequel in a successful franchise.

(Spoilers ahead)

The only film I can think of that I knew I hated before the opening credits
even finished.  Aliens was by far my favorite of all the movies in this
series and before the opening credits are even done, they kill off all the
characters which survived from #2--making Ripley's heroic rescue of Newt
totally pointless.  One of the things I liked about Aliens is that they
didn't pull the typical horror movie plot about killing everyone but the
main character and then they totally ruin it in this one.  If they couldn't
get the other actors, okay, but don't kill them off for crying out
loud.

Other things I hated about this movie: no likeable or memorable characters
(strictly monster fodder here), lousy dialog, boring backdrop, a putrid
plot
with gaping holes and even Ripley is so depressing and lame you are
actually
glad when she dies.  This is one time you would have loved for them to end
with the entire movie just being a bad dream Ripley had while sleeping in
the cryogenic chamber.  Then we could have dumped her and made a movie
about
Hicks and Bishop fighting aliens.

I give this movie a rating of 1.  It rates right up there with Highlander 2
in my opinion as one of the worst movie sequels of all
time.

<|_=00=_|>

David Fincher has populated his movie with a metric ton of completely
unsympathetic characters.  The alien spends most of its time chasing
random,
interchangeable bald convicts to their doom.  (They even *look* the same!)
Anyone who begins to show some sort of character development (the doctor
and
the dastardly warden come to mind) are slain immediately.  Only Charles S.
Dutton gets any mileage out of his character, and manages to pull off the
single act of heroism in the entire film.

As for our returning heroes:  Hicks dies off-screen.  Newt appears just
long
enough to undergo a chest-cracking autopsy.  Bishop is reactivated long
enough to lament that he is no longer "top of the line" and ask to be
switched off again.  Ripley herself spends half the movie bemoaning her
fate
("We're f*cked!") and trying to convince a convicted rapist/murderer to
kill
her and put her out of her misery.  Clearly, these don't even resemble the
scrappy, resourceful characters we've come to admire. No one seems
particularly interested in overcoming their situation; I have to ask why
should we care, either?

What does it all add up to?  There is not a single moment of suspense in
this entire movie.  I really didn't care whether the alien hunted down all
those generic convicted felons.  I didn't even really care if it hunted
down
Ripley, since she is clearly set up as doomed from the beginning. This is
grim stuff, but not in any interesting way.

<|_=00=_|>

**SPOILERS AHEAD**

I can't help thinking how much better this film could have been, had a more
talented writer and director been set to work on it, artists who had a
better feel for the series.  As it is, I just try to believe that this and
it's successor are bad dreams Ripley had after Aliens.

The plot holes indicate either a lack of commitment by the creators, or a
lack of respect toward the viewers.  For example, there is no logical way
an
egg could've gotten on the Sulaco, which means that the events in the film
couldn't have occurred in the first place.  Ripley's "great sacrifice" at
the end is meaningless, as there is an entire shipfull of eggs ready for
collection back on LV-426.

Clemens is introduced as the only truly interesting and sympathetic
character in the film besides Ripley, and yet is killed off for nothing
other than (existential?  Ironic?  Both?) shock value; all that building-up
of a character, which is then flushed down the toilet for no good reason.
The other characters are largely nameless and forgettable (excepting
possibly Dillon and "85"), existing only as cannon fodder to remind us of
how mean and scary the Alien is.

Many pro-Alien3 fans point out what an alleged departure this film is from
the first two, yet the plot is essentially identical to Alien, except with
no real suspense and no characters to root/fear for.  We've become
well-acquainted with the creatures by now, so there aren't any new
surprises
there.  The action scenes themselves are rather flat, and Fincher
completely
lacks the subtlety Scott employed with his "impressionistic" shots of the
Alien in the first film.

Fincher's cinematography is well-done, but it's overly stylistic and
distracts the viewer, like he's saying to us, "Look how clever and talented
I am!".  Weaver gives a good performance, but I just wish she had better
material to work with.  Alien3 is primarily of interest to film buffs
interested in how not to make a successful horror film.

Sad, really.
<|_=00=_|>

This film has to be the worst of the series. Whereas Alien 4 would be
hilarious if it wasn't so tragic, this is terrible in every
way.
Alien had only one, super-intelligent, creature. Aliens successfully
altered
the formula by having an army of gormless critters. This film has one
alien,
but unfortunately it's just as gormless. I won't give away plot points,
but
it does some stupid things.
The characters are all bald in this film, making it more difficult to tell
them apart. This fact, along with the fact that they are all rapists,
murderers etc. does little to generate sympathy. The only character who we
care about, played by Dance, is dropped from the story almost as soon as
he
appears.
Finally, the overall tone of the film is VERY depressing and draining.
Fincher (who should be shot for this film, however good Seven and Fight
Club
were) has tried to describe this film as upbeat. He must have some major
emotional issues as you cannot describe a film in which 95% of the cast
dies
as upbeat.

**********PLOT SPOILERS BELOW!!!!****************

I can only think that this film was Fincher's deliberate attempt to murder
a
fantastic franchise. He kills Ripley, for a start, and in killing Hicks he
destroys the possible replacement. I can see how the death of Hicks could
have worked- going down in the blaze of glory against the aliens- but the
helpless and ultimately pathetic death he suffers before the film even
starts is wholly unacceptable. Killing Newt is just cruel.

I don't know what else to say about this travesty of a film. It has
destroyed one of my favourite series of films. No wonder Alien 4 was so
bad
when it had to follow this crap.

I would give it 0/10 if I could, but I can't, so 1 it is.
<|_=00=_|>

This one is really horrible. It messes up everything that made Alien and
Aliens great movies. The transition from the end of Aliens to the
beginning
of this crap makes no sense at all. The survivors of Aliens are simply
killing off, probably for no better reason than that the script simply
doesn't fit into the Alien series at all. A military ship jettisoning its
crew after a tiny fire (don't they build warships to stand a little damage
anymore?). An "escape pod" crashes headlong into a planet with not even an
attempt at steering or breaking (wasn't there something called
"landing")?.
And all of a sudden two Aliens pop up out of nowhere. The nice high-tech
environments and cool hardware are exchanged for a prison that more
reminds
of sewers than anything else. And from there it's just a boring matter of
watching the Alien doggy eat all of those feeble, uninteresting characters
(good that suddenly humans can outrun the doggy). I have seen this one
once
and being a fan of Aliens, I regret it. If you liked Alien and Aliens, do
yourself a favor and stay away!
<|_=00=_|>

   " This is rumor control, and these are the facts.." Alien 3 pales in
comparison to the previous two films. It seems David Fincher wanted to
combine the elements of the first two films to create a dark, foreboding
action movie.Something just didn't work. For one thing there isn't anyone in
the film to truly like, after all, everyone is a double y chromo and prone
to things like murder and rape. Not exactly the cast you get all teary-eyed
over when they meet the alien. Only Riply (Sigourney Weaver) remains from
the other films, and she is acting a tad strange in this one too. For
example: Ripley is asked to remain in sick-bay because the men have not even
seen a woman in years. Remember too, that these are men that are all lifers,
having no qualms about committing horrid acts. So what does Riply do? She
goes to the mess hall to have lunch with them. Ripley was a very smart woman
in the other two films, what happened? Too long in cryogenic
sleep?
   At one point Riply tells the inmates "I've never seen one(the alien) move
Quite like this one does." I guess she hasn't seen too many poor cgi effects
before. This is the weakest of the alien series. That is, of course, until
they made Alien Resurrection.

 
<|_=00=_|>
In its complexity, "Alien3" is a failed story. It's bleak, it's flawed,
it's stupid. "Alien3" is a sequel to two of the most memorable films of
all time--and it completely ruins the ending of its 1986 predecessor,
"Aliens," by killing off two of the lasting characters and entirely
negating the emotional underpinning of the film. It practically
scratches out the second movie with its mediocrity, and the fourth
scratches out the first.

In its simplicity, it sucks.

If you recall the ending of the last film, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney
Weaver) survived her encounters with an alien colony, along with the
marine, Hicks (Michael Biehn), and a young survivalist much like
herself named Newt (Carrie Henn). They were put into cryogenic sleep
and all was well. The story ended happily and should have stayed that
way. It was the ending we all loved.

Now it's ruined. Ripley is picked up by a large space ship another
number of years later. She is the only survivor. The spaceship suffered
a malfunction. Hicks bled to death and Newt drowned in her cryo
chamber. But Ripley believes that Newt may have been impregnated with a
chestburster after finding traces of acid on the floor of the ship.

That's a problem with this film. Everything's contrived. I was willing
to believe that Ellen Ripley could and would encounter aliens once
again in the film "Aliens" because the plot was strong, so any minor
contrivances set up by James Cameron were not very noticeable. It was a
very good sci-fi film, and the more I view it on the new Quadrilogy
DVD, the more I grow to like it.

Same with "Alien3." The new cut is better than the old one. But it's
still an awful film--so bad that everyone associated with it has only
bad things to say about it. Even its director, David Fincher, has
reportedly disowned the film. He claims that the film is not his, that
FOX controlled every aspect of it. He was the only director on the
entire Quadrilogy DVD collection to refuse a DVD commentary track
recording. 

"Alien3," even with the superior extended version, still stinks to high
heaven. Fincher can disown the film all he wants, but he still made it.
The "Alien" series was always dark and brooding and somewhat
disturbing, but this pushes the limit--it's too dark, too brooding, too
disturbing. The characters are extremely strange and weird; Ellen
Ripley is very different, and her new hairstyle--no hair--is just
silly. This whole film is just too dark. 

Another problem? There's nowhere to go after "Aliens." In 1979, "Alien"
introduced the new face of horror a year after John Carpenter's
"Halloween." The two back-to-back slasher flicks were both very
different and yet very similar. One took place in the future, one in
the present. Both were films about killing creatures (for Michael Myers
is not a human). And so to change the genre, in 1986 James Cameron made
the sequel an all-out combat film, preparing audiences for the change
with the tagline, "This time it's war." He wanted people to know that
it wasn't "Alien." It was "Aliens."

"Alien3" is infamous for its awfulness. It is the movie no one wants to
claim credit for. Not Fincher, not Hill, not the producers, and not
even FOX, really. It made a lot of cash, but for the most part everyone
hated it. Some die-hard fans enjoy it, but if you ask them, they'll
always tell you that it's the worst of the series (sometimes they
choose "Alien Resurrection," though).

I'll tell you what: It's certainly my least favorite. I hate this
movie. I literally find it painful to watch. And I wouldn't even call
myself a huge fan of this series. But it bugs me when directors take
liberties to kill off characters. The story of James Cameron's hatred
for "Alien3" is pretty well known. Some people say he needs to get over
it. Now he's talking about making a sequel with Ridley and forgetting
about the latter two sequels. I don't think this is a good idea
(forgetting the other two--it would confuse audiences), but I don't
blame him for despising "Alien3" and often referencing it as an awful
film in his interviews. 

Alien: 5/5 Aliens: 5/5 Alien3: 1.5/5 Alien Resurrection: 2.5/5
<|_=00=_|>

During this movie I found watching the inside of my eyelids much more
appealing.  Something was just plain wrong about the whole movie.  The
biggest problem was that I didn't care about any of the characters but
Ripley.  This film was made in between the use of actual puppets and good
computer animation (which is still obvious).  That means that many times the
Alien looked very fake.  I thought the monster was more realistic in the
original Alien.

Nothing was suspenseful of scary about this movie.  The Alien point of view
ruins the mystery and suspense of the Alien.  I don't want to see what the
Alien is seeing, what's the fun in that?  I don't want to know where its
going, I just want to be surprised.  

Also, Ripley crashing on a planet of double Y chromosome rapists was
immediately lame.  Also, the doctor's little sob story made me wanna stop
the movie right there.  This movie had all the elements of a cheezy
blockbuster, an embarrassment to the series.  Because of this film, I'll
probably never rent Alien: Resurrection.  I can't even imagine the
far-fetched, pathetic way Ripley comes back.  I heard that Jeunet directed
that film without knowing how to speak English to the cast.  As the
Godfather and Star Wars series' pointed out, three's a crowd.  This is not
an exception.  6/10 
<|_=00=_|>
Alien^3 is a textbook example of how too much studio control can
destroy a potentially decent film. After the massive success of Aliens,
the studio wanted yet another film to bring in more profit. That makes
perfect sense to me. If you have a good thing going then why not milk
it? But here's the problem: Aliens ended with very little wiggle room
in which to make another film. For all intents and purposes, it was the
end of the story. As Alien^3 went through various drafts, the numerous
writers attempted to bring new things into the story regarding the
aliens. For example, William Gibson's screenplay had the idea of the
aliens having an alternate means of reproduction via spores. A very
neat idea, mind you, and the descriptions of the transformations in the
script would've made for very horrific imagery on film.

Unfortunately, Alien^3 decided to throw any good ideas out the window
and magically place an alien egg aboard our heroes' ship, despite the
fact that in the previous film we are shown that the Queen has left her
eggs at the hive.

And I'm just getting warmed up.

Another common gripe about Alien^3 is the death of the characters Newt
and Hicks. Many fans of the film felt that it was necessary and that it
helped eliminate the "happy ending" of Aliens. I personally don't think
it was a bad idea to kill off the characters, except that it was
executed poorly on screen. Their deaths carried no meaning other than
to forcefully make Ripley a fish out of water again. Not only that, but
Newt and Hicks (who were engaging characters) are replaced by
uninteresting stock characters who serve no other purpose than to be
cannon fodder. Now the previous two films had their share of cannon
fodder, but they at least left you wondering who exactly was going to
die. Example: few suspected that Ripley would be the sole survivor of
Alien.

Lastly, people complain that Alien^3 was nothing more than a retread of
the original film. That's very true. Except that, unlike Alien, this
film didn't work. Instead we are treated to a rather formulaic
slasher-like storyline. The ending is one of the few parts that truly
work and it serves as an excellent bookend to the series.

Director David Fincher, who was unfortunately reduced to the level of
studio puppet, does manage to save the film with his talent in creating
a moody atmosphere. One can only wonder how much better this film might
have been had he been given a greater amount of control.

Alien^3 could best be described as "the great sequel that never was".
Given a more interesting script and more control on the director's
part, this film could've been at least as good as it's predecessors.
Fortunately, Fox took a step in the right direction with Alien
Resurrection by having entertaining characters and a more original
story.
