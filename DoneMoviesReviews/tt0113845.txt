Reading the reviews below this seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it kind of
film. Regardless of whether you 'get' the story and the rapport between
Harrelson and Snipes, you can't overlook that this is a well made film.

I've only seen it twice, once when it first came out on video, and again
in
the past week. I didn't think it was that remarkable when it first came
out,
but when I watched it the second time around, I found it highly
entertaining
and well executed. Granted, it's not the best film ever but I don't think
it's deserving of a lot of the bad reviews given here.

As a film it succeeds, and if you've never seen it before, it's worth
checking out.

Popcorn is the word that most describes this action-comedy movie from
Joseph Reuben, the man who directed other standard fare like SLEEPING
WITH THE ENEMY, TRUE BELIEVER, THE STEPFATHER, DREAMSCAPE, and most
recently, a notorious bomb called THE FORGOTTEN.

So let's see how I can dive into this pool without hitting a hard
surface. This is a "buddy-movie" in which two uber-American guys of
very different temperaments and backgrounds share a bond that goes
beyond anything they might go through. One of the two is by default a
loose cannon and drives the plot with his antics. There may be some
tension when a corrupt high official threatens the loose cannon. Add a
sexy new co-worker into the mix (which becomes the focus of their
intense, male attraction) and basically you have a story that has been
of late the norm in the Hollywood popcorn machine.

Now, trying to cash in (I believe, I could be wrong) on their previous
outing WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP, Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes play not
buddies from the 'hood but foster 'brothas' (if we can believe this
baby) who are closer than a cuticle is to a finger even though Snipes
has to act as older brother to a rebellious and unpredictable
Harrelson: and on that note, neither is miscast. Snipes does convey
steel while Harrelson gives off his just-under-the-surface danger,
especially when he grins at smarmy boss Robert Blake in one subway
scene.

Pitching in for the Latina female is Jennifer Lopez who, without being
as angry and nasal and in-your-face as Rosie Perez, actually manages to
be engaging though this is early in her career, before she decided to
punch out and play her (bland) self once she became the trademark known
as J. Lo. She all but steals her own pat scenes, especially in one
tense exchange she has with Chris Cooper playing a not-so-nice fellow
who pushes people onto subway platforms, a reality among New York
strap-hangers.

But trying to over-analyze this film in terms of shots and composition
and visual technicality would be like trying to compare one grain of
popcorn to the next: there would be no difference, no relevance in
taste, texture, and all that is left to do is munch down. That the
action scenes on the subway platforms (for anyone who is actually
acquainted with riding the subways in New York City) are as implausible
as ever and only convey the type of hyper-masculinized action that
makes superheroes of its actors, but who really cares? It's fluff,
entertaining, mindless, inane, and that's just what people going to see
this type of film expect.

Personally speaking, I don't quite know what to make of this picture. I saw
it again on late night cable the other night and I was laughing hysterically
throughout. Wesley and Woody play two brothers (!) who work as transit cops.
Woody's a gambling junkie with a huge debt on his back while Wesley plays
the straight man who's getting a little tired of constantly having to bail
his brother out. Desperate, Woody plans to hijack the Money Train that rides
along to each station, collecting the night's collections. Folks, believe me
when I tell you that it actually gets more ridiculous. Add to the mix a
pyromaniac token booth bandit, a pre-lobotomy Jennifer Lopez, Robert Blake
in a performance so hammy that you can almost smell the bacon coming from
your tv, action sequences that are unabashedly ridiculous and you have
yourself... Money Train. My favorite moment comes when Robert Blake, after
having been informed of the possibility of civilian casualties if the
hijacked Money Train continues to speed ahead on the local line, responds
with the now-classic line, "That's what we live with." I was laughing so
hard that tears were squirting out of my eyes. This movie is utterly
ridiculous yet strangely riveting. Wesley Snipes plays his usual cocky,
confident self and it seems to me that he won't accept a role these days
unless he gets to kick someone in the face. Woody Harrelson looks like he
smoked one too many blunts in this one. I actually prefer his character here
over Wesley's and that's not saying much. Jennifer Lopez looks damn good but
I can't help but think how stupid she is in real life. I really don't know
where else to go with this review other than to recommend watching it. You
might like it but not because it's quality stuff but because it'll cheer you
up, it's so bad. Actual rating ** out of ***** but on the laugh-o-meter I'll
give it a full **** out of *****.

Money Train is a great popcorn movie and Snipes and Harrison once again show
the chemistry that makes a good buddy movie.  The script is fast-paced and
clever and Jennifer Lopez is as beautiful and sexy as always.  This film is
a true "sleeper hit" and is well worth the effort to catch-up with if you
missed it the first time around.

Not really a very good movie. Much of the plot is unbelievable and
implausible.

However, I do find that I enjoy watching this from time to time. I seem
to enjoy just about anything with Wesley Snipes. I believe he is very
underrated. His easygoing, but dedicated cop in this works for me. He
works hard, is smart, and seems to be someone you can rely on. He cares
deeply for the "brother" who grew up in his house, but he is frustrated
in constantly having to bail him out of trouble.

I suppose Woody Harrelson's character is probably the worst thing about
this for me. His character is seriously annoying, and it would be hard
to believe him surviving as a police officer, with all his personal
problems. It's okay to suspend disbelief, but a movie like this should
at least have an air of plausibility.

Robert Blake's subway manager is quite a bit over-the-top, but provides
a real antagonism for the buddy/brother cops, and establishes himself
as the real villain for the plot.

The plan, and the execution of the robbery, (and Snipes character going
along with something like this), REALLY stretches plausibility, but
there is an easy camaraderie between the 2 actors, and the action is
good.

It ain't all that good, but it isn't unwatchable.

This is one of Wesley Snipes best (in my opinion), with great action
scenes, an awesome finale and an amazing performance from Wesley
Snipes!. All the characters are fantastic, and the story is really
cool, plus Wesley Snipes is simply amazing in this!, and Woody
Harrelson is fantastic!. Wesley and Woody had fantastic chemistry
together, and i was really surprised, by how much i enjoyed the film!,
plus Jennifer Lopez surprised me, by giving a very good performance!.
Robert Blake is excellent as the dick, i hated him, and i thought, it
had some great humor as well!, plus the ending is hilarious. You really
get to see Snipe's incredible Martial art abilities, and the fight
scenes are awesome!, plus one of my favorite scenes is when Snipes and
Lopez have a boxing match, it was quite amusing!. Snipes and Lopez had
great chemistry together, and it's very well made as well!, plus i
thought Snipe's acting was fantastic!. This is one of Wesley Snipes
best (in my opinion), with great action scenes, an awesome finale, and
amazing performance from Wesley Snipes!, and i say it's a must see!.
The Direction is great!. Joseph Ruben does a great job! here, with
excellent camera work, awesome angles,and keeping the film at a very
fast pace!. The Acting is fantastic!. Wesley Snipes is amazing as
always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, hilarious had
wonderful chemistry with Woody Harrelson, kicked that ass, had loads of
charisma, seemed to be enjoying himself, never really took himself
seriously, and was just amazing overall! (Snipes Rules!!!!!). Woody
Harrelson is fantastic here, he is extremely hilarious had wonderful
chemistry with Snipes,like Snipes seemed to be enjoying himself, had a
great sense of humor, and once again him and Snipes made a terrific
pair! (Woody rules). Jennifer Lopez is stunningly gorgeous!, and does
very well with what she had to do, i was quite surprised, she also had
great chemistry with Snipes. Robert Blake is great as the prick, i
hated his guts, and cheered out loud when he got punched and arrested!.
Chris Cooper is extremely creepy in his role, and was quite menacing.
Bill Nun is great in his cameo (Nunn Rules!). Rest of the cast do fine.
Overall a must see!. **** out of 5

The movie doesn't have much of a plot but it's still a pretty entertaining
movie. Which features great performances from the cast. It's nice for a
Saturday night at the movies.

This is certainly an action movie that deserves alot of credit. Instead,
everyone brings it down like it's the worst one ever made. If you're
interested in seeing a shallow, meaningless action film, rent Tango & Cash.
That trash should've never been made. This is way better than that. Money
Train has a marvelous cast, applausable action, and sizzling music. 8 out
of
10.

Action is an interesting film genre. You go in expecting little and are
pleasantly surprised if you get more. Films like Face/Off, Die Hard,
Speed, Under Siege, while formulaic, were all able to offer the viewer
more than they expected going in and so have become beloved classics of
the genre. The Money Train tries to be more than a lot of the action
films that came out and simply disappeared in the early 90s, but falls
a little short. While the film certainly isn't bad, it isn't considered
a classic of the genre, and, while not a financial failure, relatively
few people saw it and even fewer remember it.

The film reunites the stars of White Men Can't Jump, Woody Harrelson
and Wesley Snipes as a pair of law enforcement officers John (Snipes)
and Charlie (Harrelson) who basically decide to steal from their boss
(Robert Blake) who is a real piece of work. John has a hot girlfriend
Grace (a pre Selena Jennifer Lopez) and Charlie has a gambling problem.
Sound familiar? There are some funny moments and the dramatic scenes
between Snipes and Harrelson are excellent. But aside from these, there
really aren't any memorable moments. While the pairing of Snipes and
Harrelson isn't tired, it doesn't have the same impact it had on their
previous outing. Blake is menacing and odious but his character is not
a believable or effective villain. Chris Cooper, who has a smaller role
in this as Torch, would have been a better antagonist.

Money Train is OK and a reasonably entertaining way to spend a couple
of hours, but it is also a missed opportunity. Snipes, Lopez, Harrelson
and Blake try hard, but the finished product is less than the sum of
its parts, and that's possibly the most frustrating thing of all.

Money Train is one of those films that is NOT A MUST SEE , but it is
worth a check out if it is on the TV or if you got nothing better to do
on your Friday night then its worth a rent . In my opinion I found it a
lot more enjoyable then White Men Can't Jump , its sort of like a down
graded high speed version of Oceans 11 . The chemistry between Snipes
and Harrelson is spot on and it works well for a third time . There is
not much of a plot to the film just an average screw your average
ass-hole boss movie which I like at this point and time because it
reminds me of the relationship I have with my boss not to mention the
slight money problems I'm having . Jennifer Lopez just bobs up now and
then but in this case her screen presence is welcoming . I don't want
to be fussy and pick out several little pieces and analyse them , this
film was a simple time killing pop-corn movie that should viewed when
you don't feel like watching something heavy or you'd rather check this
out rather than Santa's Slay . 

MONEY TRAIN - 5.6 OUT 10 - THATS WHAT WE LIVE WITH .
