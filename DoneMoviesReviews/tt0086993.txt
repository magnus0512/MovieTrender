Being a fan of British naval history, and also a fan of Anthony Hopkins, I
love this film. I think it is severely under-rated. The acting (particularly
by Hopkins) is superb, and the cinematography and realism are
stunning.

Unlike some of the previous comments for this film I think it is pretty
loyal to the true historical facts of the real mutiny. Alright, there are a
few minor changes to fact, but nothing that radically alters the story.
Basically Bligh was a very able and fair captain, who was let down by
incompetent officers. Bligh was no more a monster than any other Royal Navy
captains, the difference was other Royal Navy Captains had able commissioned
officers and a squad of marines to back up their authority. Bligh was on his
own, because the admiralty insisted on saving money on the bread-fruit
expedition by giving Bligh a small ship and no officers. (All the officers
on board were non-commissioned warrant officers, who were not employed by
the Royal Navy but were in it for their own advancement, Blight was the only
Royal Navy officer). This is what ultimately led to the mutiny. Bligh had no
one he could rely on to back up his orders from the Admiralty. Bligh was
actually an exponent of modern thinking, and treated his men with much more
humanity than other Royal Navy Captains. He had learnt his trade from
sailing under Captain Cook.

I think Hopkins manages to capture this in his performance. Bligh was a
professional man, who grew increasingly frustrated by the incompetence and
laziness of his officers. Hopkins manages to convey this sense of increasing
irritation brilliantly. He felt particularly let down by Fletcher Christian,
who was his friend and whom he had personally advanced up the ranks. He
expected Fletcher to back up his orders, but Fletcher was more interested in
his own pleasure with the Tahitian women.

On the journey out the crew were actually very happy and contented, but the
trouble began when the crew began to experience the liberties and freedoms
of Tahitian life, and they did not want to leave it. Bligh had to force the
men to go back to their duty, and instead of having officers to back him up,
the officers took the side of the men.

I think the script of this film captures the true story quite well. I saw
the Clark Gable version of the story many years ago, and the only thing I
remember is the portrayal of Bligh as an irrational monster, with none of
the reasons behind his anger explained. In this version I feel Hopkins is
more like the real Bligh. An able commander trying to carry out his orders,
but let down by those around him.

The confrontation between Bligh and Christian in the captain's cabin the day
before the mutiny is one of my favourite movie scenes of all time. Hopkins
performance of the captain at the end of his patience is just outstanding.
`Oh there are rumblings are there?'. Superb! 

The only down side to this film is Mel Gibson. I can't stand the sight of
him! Mind you, even he manages to pull of a good performance.

The film ends quite abruptly, with a lot of loose ends. The most fascinating
parts of the true story come after the end of the film. I guess the time
constraints of the film mean they had to concentrate on just the story of
the mutiny.

The mutineers set up a colony on Pitcairn, and ended up all murdering each
other until only one survived (Jack Adams). Those that stayed on Tahiti were
captured two years later by HMS Pandora which had been dispatched after
Bligh got back to England. This ship rounded up about 16 mutineers, and on
the way home the Pandora hit a reef off Australia and sunk. The crew had to
make an open boat journey to Coupang, the same port that Bligh's life boat
had arrived at two years earlier!! 

Meanwhile Bligh was promoted and sent off on another Breadfruit exhibition
to Tahiti, this time the Admiralty gave him commissioned officers and a
squad of marines. This mission succeeded.

When the Breadfruit plants finally reached the slave colonies in the West
Indies, the slaves refused to eat the fruit as they disliked the taste.
That's irony for you!

I will admit, I thought I'd seen it all when I first saw Charles Laughton
bring the snivelling and maniacal Captain Bligh to life. I was dead wrong.
Anthony Hopkins, whom I place on the highest rank of accomplished actors,
recreates the memorable role with incredible flair and complexity. He shows
us not just an insane seaman bent on ultimate subordination, but a man with
real concern for maintaining order, knowing the consequences of anything
less. "The Bounty", yet another retelling of the classic tale, is actually an
amazing recreation of the sea fable, pumped with real emotion and drama. The
writers really understand the characters in this story, especially in
Bligh's case, but also in Fletcher Christian's as well. Mel Gibson reigns
over the role this time, still fresh from his Australian beginnings, and
undoubtedly one of the best at perfecting the challenged and affected hero.
I proudly rave this version of the famous mutiny, and probably will place
this among 1984's best films.
Rating: Three stars and a half.

I have seen this film many time over the years and i never get bored of
watching Sir Anthony Hopkins give a riveting performance in this
classic story of life aboard The Bounty and the events that lead to
mutiny. 

Mel Gibson plays Fletcher Christian who must watch helplessly as his
captain(Hopkins) demoralizes his men and drives them ever closer to the
brink of mutiny. The tension builds throughout the film and in no small
part to the excellent score. The disgruntled crew has many recognisable
faces including Liam Neeson and Bernard Hill which makes the film all
the more enjoyable. Daniel Day Lewis is particularly watchable as mr.
frier, showing us a rather smug and sometimes fiery officer. The film
is shot beautifully and the story is compelling. Even the script holds
up in a film where the best performances come from the actors with the
least to say.
<|_=00=_|>

Mel Gibson, Anthony Hopkins, Daniel Day-Lewis, Laurence Olivier, Liam
Neeson, Bernard Hill....and the list goes on as you can
see.
Where are these people now?  All making big hit movies.  You can't help but
love this movie.  Every time I see it, I want to see it again.  I know of
no
other movie that has had an impact like THAT on me before.  Every actor in
the movie was great.  Also, notice that the mass of extras REALLY act like
the real thing.  That is rare, and hard to do.  I was an extra in Sudden
Death (Van Damme), and you can't help but look into the camera or do weird
things.  It's fun.
Try an find some of the continuity errors in this movie.  They're hard to
find, VERY.  I only found a few after seeing the movie 10-15 times.  It's
almost flawless.
The scenery was breathtaking.  I only regret not seeing the movie on the
"big screen".
I gave this movie 10+ points.  There is nothing like it (obviously, my
opinion).
I thought it was one of Neeson's greatest roles, especially the beginning
where "Quintal is in his seat".  That scene was shot beautifully.
Gibson's girlfriend is quite gorgeous.  It's no wonder why he did what he
did (now I'm getting to the movie again)...
Enjoy!

The Bounty in all rights may not be a great movie. From time to time it
drags on but what sets it apart from its predecessors is that its
portrayal of Bligh has much more depth. The Bounty does not simply show
men as good and evil but as more complex figures.

Bligh is played here by Anthony Hopkins and is done so wonderfully. In
the movie he is being court-marshaled for the events that took place
aboard ship. Unlike the past films here his actions seem to have more
logical motivations rather than him being Captain Hitler. Yet for all
the depth Hopkins puts in his performance Mel Gibson comes up short in
that he is just there. He is supposed to take on the role of a leader
but instead fades into the background time after time.

I like the way the movie was directed taking the flashback approach
from the view of Hopkins. It gave the movie some sort of originality
which is very hard to do with remakes. This film though was strictly
carried by the performance of Anthony Hopkins and his complex portrayal
of Captain Bligh.
<|_=00=_|>

No cast can beat the one in the Bounty.  Just look at the list, Anthony
Hopkins, Mel Gibson, Bernard Hill, Daniel Day Lewis, Liam Neeson, Laurence
Oliver and even a young Neil Morrissey who puts in a good performance.  I
have seen three versions of The Bounty, the one with Clark Gable, the one
with Brando and this and this version directed by Roger Donaldson is by far
my favourite because it is so much more darker than the others.   For one we
have Anthony Hopkins as a caring but ruthless Captain Bligh who is hell bent
on his ship sailing around Cape Town or something like that and the shipmen
believe that doing it once was bad enough but doing it twice is suicide and
that is where the film really kicks off but there are moments of tension
between Bligh and Fletcher played by Mel Gibson and that's what makes this
film all the more special than its predecessors.   

If this film was made today with the same cast then it would not have had
the same effect because it would have tried to win over it's audience with
it's cast but the likes of Day Lewis, Liam Neeson and Mel Gibson were still
unknowns in most countries and it was like an older version of the rat pack
as they were the fresh faces coming up in the movies in 80's Hollywood
especially for Gibson who just made action in the 80's apart from The Bounty
and Gallipoli.   What makes this movie all the more better was it's haunting
soundtrack by Vangelis.   Every scene in the film which contains a piece
from the soundtrack is just spine tingling and the scene where Fletcher
takes over the ship and the men are gathering together to mutiny is just
fantastic.  

It's not the best film ever but it feels like it when you watch it but then
you take it in and you think of some of the scenes they could have included.
 A few more scenes between Bligh and Fletcher wouldn't have gone a miss and
a bit more on Laurence Oliver's character but what we did see of him was
more than enough and I shouldn't complain.

it's strange how Hollywood is responsible for so much bad history being
foisted upon the common knowledge of humanity . The Battle Of Little
Big Horn is perceived to have been a glorious defeat for the 7th
Calvary and where George A Custer was the last soldier to die . The
defeat of that unit was anything but glorious for the regiment who put
up a very poor fight while there's no evidence that Custer died as the
last man standing . Modern perception of historical events is full of
factual mistakes that can be laid firmly at the door of Hollywood 

The mutiny on The Bounty is another example of Hollywood revisionist
history . Since so many people have seen some tyrant being cruel to the
noble Errol Flynn , Clark Gable or Marlon Brando it enters their mind
that it must be somehow true . What I loved about this version is that
it's very much accurate where the known facts are concerned . Captain
Bligh might have been an authoritarian but there's no way he could in
the context of the time be described as a cruel tyrant . On British
naval ships at the time the Captain's word was the word of god but
unlike the British army at the time where more often than not officers
bought their rank the Royal Navy was a meritocracy where Captain's
started at the very bottom of the ladder and worked their way up ,
bumbling fools didn't get very far in this service . It's also
interesting to note that Bligh had a trio of deserters flogged rather
than hanged , an act of compassion that contributes to his downfall .
The film doesn't go into great detail about the fate of the mutineers
but it insinuates that they eventually ended up murdering one another
on Pitcairn leaving just one survivor . Like thieves there's no honour
amongst mutineers which history like this film should judge as being in
the wrong 

THE BOUNTY is a beautiful film experience . I watched it on a
widescreen TV via DVD and if David Lean had directed this he could not
have done a better job than Roger Donaldson has . You can almost feel
the sunlight touch you thanks to Arthur Ibbetsen's cinematography and
it's impossible not to mention the then mainly unknown cast . With the
exception of Olivier , Fox and Gibson probably the most well known
actor to a 1984 audience would be Bernard Hill who had won a BAFTA the
previous year for BOYS FROM THE BLACKSTUFF , it's amazing to think at
this time very few people had heard of Liam Neeson or Daniel Day Lewis
. Some people might have heard of Anthony Hopkins but only if they'd
seen MAGIC and A BRIDGE TOO FAR and had a very good memory for faces .
Hopkins gives a great and sympathetic performance , one of the best of
his career in fact 

There's not too much to criticise about THE BOUNTY . I did feel that
Vangelis electronic soundtrack didn't really go with the visuals , and
the interior of the ship seemed just a little too clean to be
convincing while I would have liked to have seen the journey of the
marooned Bligh and his loyalists ( A journey so amazing that if a
fiction writer wrote it no one would have believed it ) in a little
more detail but these are very minor criticisms and this is a very good
historical adventure film
<|_=00=_|>

A wonderfully atmospheric retelling of an old classic with a terrific
cast and a haunting soundtrack supplied by Vangelis. If you like
costume dramas with weight then you will love this film as it has all
the swash without the buckle! Anthony Hopkins gives his usual powerful
performance as the baddie-turned-victim and by the end of the film I am
sure that like me you will want to see him vindicated. Mel Gibson
struggles somewhat in the shadow of Hopkins but gives his all as
Fletcher Christian. The atmosphere of the tropical island paradise is
brilliantly captured and the scene showing the demise of the ship is,
like the music, very haunting. There's no going back now Fletch!! Look
out for John Sessions in a cameo role.

I'm only giving this film 8 stars, because as good as it is "the
Bounty" still leaves some undeserved blots on the reputation of a great
and courageous man. A bit more truth and this film would get a TEN from
me.

There have been many film treatments of this amazing story, but only
"The Bounty" gets it even halfway right. The 1935 Lawton/Gable "Mutiny
on the Bounty" is 49% balderdash and 51% falsehood. The Trevor
Howard/Marlon Bando stinker is even less factual. "The Bounty", however
is pretty good history in many places, especially Bligh's court-martial
and the actual mutiny sequence, which is almost word-for-word what
Bligh recorded in his own writings on the matter. The ship itself is
correctly represented, right down to the figurehead  a woman in a blue
riding habit, which makes no sense until one realizes that HMAV Bounty
was originally a merchant ship called the Bethia.

The movie does take liberties with history. Some characters are
composites and some important figures are absent entirely. In the plot
Bligh seeks out Christian to be his second officer. In reality
Christian was a friend of Bligh's wife's family, and it was he who
sought a posting on Bounty; Bligh didn't solicit his participation. In
fact Bligh jiggered the ship's roster to make room for Christian.

But the worst departure from fact is the business about Cape Horn and
circumnavigation. The movie wants us to believe that Bligh chose the
route for his own glory. Not true. Bligh complained to the Admiralty
about the chosen course before they set sail from England, thinking it
too dangerous for such a small vessel. But he was overruled. The return
trip was never intended to go by way of Cape Horn. The cargo was
breadfruit seedlings, a tropical plant that can't endure the kind of
temperatures encountered in the Drake Passage or the Straits of
Magellan. Bligh was forbidden to return via this route. Even if he
wanted to such a course of action would have ruined his career. Also
the mutiny occurred near Tofua, about 1300 miles west of Tahiti, the
wrong direction to sail if you're bound for Cape Horn.

Bligh was a man and a professional. Christian was a silly, overwrought
upper class schoolboy who committed a vile crime over puppy love of a
Polynesian girl. He got away with attempted mass murder, and 200 years
later people still praise him. Bligh was a true hero who hasn't got
justice yet.
<|_=00=_|>
The latest retelling of this tale shifts a lot of the blame about the
voyage over to Fletcher Christian and the fact that he and a lot of the
crew had simply gone native. 

One of the great villainous portrayals on the screen is Charles
Laughton's Captain Bligh from the stirring 1935 film. Laughton is
pretty unforgettable with that jutting lower lip and that bellowing
voice at the crew. Anthony Hopkins has given us a kinder, gentler view
of Bligh which may be far closer to the facts.

Bligh certainly was a stern taskmaster as a captain of a naval vessel.
In fact he served with distinction in several naval battles during the
Napoleonic wars. What he unfortunately had was a sarcastic tongue,
something not really needed for what in fact was a peaceful voyage to
obtain breadfruit plants.

Scurvy which is caused by a Vitamin C deficiency ran rampant on the
ocean going ships of the time, none more so than in British ships
because they had the most of them. This was a pretty important voyage,
to bring back Tahitian breadfruit to see if it could be cultivated in
the climate of the United Kingdom. Maybe the mistake was in not sending
a civilian ship to do the job, who knows.

Anyway Bligh punished men who got out of line, no more so than what was
normal. The problem arose when after months at sea, his crew got just
too used to frolicking among the female population of Tahiti. That
would also unfortunately include Bligh's second mate Fletcher
Christian, played in this version by Mel Gibson.

It wasn't Bligh's fault they lingered in Tahiti, the plants had to be
mature enough to stand the voyage to Great Britain. Nevertheless the
lack of discipline there, contrasted with what was expected of British
seaman on a naval vessel, a return to that life was what led to the
mutiny. 

Certainly Fletcher Christian by all accounts was a charismatic guy, he
would have to have been to get the men to mutiny. He was portrayed by
four charismatic actors, Errol Flynn, Clark Gable, Marlon Brando, and
now Mel Gibson. Only his intervention prevented the men from killing
Bligh and a few others.

What I like most about this version is the fact that it does give due
attention to Bligh's remarkable voyage in a long boat to Timor which
was some 1500 miles from where he and the loyalists were cast adrift.
It was a remarkable piece of seamanship, no mutinies during that
voyage. 

The luckless Captain Bligh also had the misfortune to be the Governor
of New South Wales, appointed by the Crown, and was overthrown there in
a power struggle with the merchants of the colony. That didn't help his
historical reputation a bit.

Among the crew of the Bounty you will find Daniel Day-Lewis as John
Fryer who Bligh replaced mid voyage with Fletcher Christian and Liam
Neeson as one of the mutineers. Laurence Olivier plays Admiral Hood who
led the court of inquiry that cleared Bligh of blame for the mutiny.

Still Hopkins and Gibson dominate the film with their skills and
talents. Who knows who might bring the saga of this troubled ship next
to the screen. This story has fascinated us for generations.
