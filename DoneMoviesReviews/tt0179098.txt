"Moonlight Mile" is one of the most beautiful films ever to be made.
Highlighted by phenomenal performances by Hoffman, Sarandon and Hunter,
the film is truly inspiring, despite some overly-sentimental moments.

Brad Silberling has created an amazing piece of film. The story starts
out quite shakily, but manages to quickly find its feet and, thus,
saves itself from being another overly-indulgent, kitchy movie. Some
might battle with "Moonlight Mile"'s pace, as the film takes its time
in developing its characters. However, the film is character-driven and
these developments are fundamental to the film's progression.

Holly Hunter's performance is Oscar worthy, even though her role is
quite small. Judi Dench won an Oscar for her 8 minute performance in
"Shakespeare in love" and I see no reason why Hunter should not have
been nominated. Amongst a cast of film legends, Jake Gyllenhaal holds
his ground. It is obvious that he has had less experience in the acting
field, but his performance is still great. Gyllenhaal's climatic
monologue near the end of the film will give you goosebumps. It is the
best part of the film and in my opinion one of the best scenes in
cinema history.

In a film about one of the most life-changing, traumatic experiences
one can endure, subtlety rules. Little things drive the film and the
characters in the film begin to appreciate the smaller things in life.
And that's what makes the film so beautiful and so real. The subtlety
of the comedy and romance is what makes the drama that much more
bearable - which brings us back to the films central theme: coming to
terms with loss and trying to move on from it. These beautiful little
moments are what make the film.

One might have mistaken "Moonlight Mile" for a Cameron Crowe film as
music plays a vital part. The film's music is as evocative as the
action on screen and the film's epic moments are emphasised by the
films perfectly fitted music.

This film has been overlooked and underrated, and should have received
more credit. Silberling has crafted an outstanding piece of cinema,
which is rich with emotion and evocatively inspiring. Some cynics may
find the film too sentimental and will claim they predicted the entire
movie, but if one is able to ignore the odd mushy moment (there's one
or two), "Moonlight Mile" is a cinematic triumph. Treat yourself to
this amazing film!

This is a very well acted movie that deals with a sudden loss in a family in
a better way than I would expect. The movie avoids the usual clichés and
through some very strong performances shows us how it could really be. The
dead person is the daughter of Ben (Dustin Hoffman) and Jojo (Susan
Sarandon), her fiancé named Joe (Jake Gyllenhaal) is now living with them.
The girl was murdered, simply because she was in the wrong place at the
wrong time. Now Ben and Joe go into business together and the all try to
live on in their own ways. Joe befriends a girl named Bertie Knox (Ellen
Pompeo) who also has lost someone.

Like I said the subject is handled in a very good way. May be the movie
makes some easy choices, especially near the end, but the acting is so good
and real here that the movie is easily forgiven. Gyllenhaal plays the same
kind of part as he did in 'Donnie Darko' and 'The Good Girl', not the most
happy one. He has the best single scene, although overall veterans Hoffman
and Sarandon are as good as he is. The best thing though is Ellen Pompeo.
Her character has a certain sweetness and nice way of dealing with things
and Pompeo finds the perfect note for playing this part. See it for the
acting and you will find a lot more.

True, this movie is not for everyone. It is not for action junkies and
it isn't that exciting as dramas go. But the excellent acting by the
three main leads will hold your attention, if you let yourself get into
it.

Dustin Hoffman is completely believable as the dad whose hopes and
dreams have vanished with his daughter and he struggles to hold on to
them in a state of denial. Susan Sarandon's character has accepted the
fact and turns away from friends' sympathy. And as the fiancée in a
slight state of paralysis from numbness, Jake Gyllenhaal proves he can
play more than disturbed teen. The girl's parents try to hold onto him
as their last hope of clinging to their daughter. Joe (Gyllenhaal)
doesn't want to hurt them by leaving, but has to find his own path now.

The actors keep the movie going for longer than expected. Even though
by the end you're glad it's over, it'll stick in your mind. It's the
kind of movie you only see once, or else you'll get sick of it. But the
one time will be enough for you to appreciate its quiet despair and
hope.
<|_=00=_|>
This film is perfect if your looking for a good cry but with some
humorous bits too, in fact this films got everything you want in a
drama, joy, sadness, hope, fear the lot. OK this movie is not for
everyone some people are bound to find it really boring and a bit of a
drag so if you into all action and full of energy kind of films then I
would advise you not to even consider this but to all the people who
are into dramas or Jake Gyllenhaal then I would recommend this movie
100%. The acting is truly amazing, they are all really believable as
the roles they are playing. Dustin Hoffman and Susan Sarandon as the
parents of their murdered daughter, Ben and Jo Jo, clinging on to her
fiancée as they feel he is a big part of her and don't want to see him
leave them too, while Jake Gyllenhaal as the part of Joe the nearly
son-and -law to Ben and Jo,Jo, who tries to be perfect for them and be
everything he wants them to be despite what he wants..which he really
doesn't even know..he's confused..doesn't know what he wants to do in
life. As he said, "I want to figure out what I want to do". 

This film is truly beautiful and shows deep emotion that isn't in any
way corny.A film that I think is very underrated.To be honest I saw it
for Jake Gyllenhaal but after seeing it it is now one of my favourite
Jake films.

I loved it!
<|_=00=_|>

This movie was a surprise to me. Tuned it in on HBO and enjoyed the
entire movie, laughing out loud at several surprise parts. The
characters run the gamut of emotions, and those who did not enjoy this
movie never took the time to gauge the feelings of the characters
involved. Ellen Pompeo's character is fabulous, Dustin Hoffman's whole
demeanor shows a father's grief, but in his own way. 

I highly recommend this movie to those who take a little time to read
the characters, and who don't expect the director and writer to spell
it all out for them.

Enjoy!

*** out of ****

While not quite a great movie (it just barely misses the mark), Moonlight
Mile is still an excellent drama that showcases some of the finest acting
talent around, wrapped amidst a beautifully told story of a young man (Jake
Gyllenhaal) who's trying to do what everyone expects out of him, but against
the desire of following his own heart.  

Moonlight Mile plays as a cathartic experience.  The premise bears truth to
it, as it parallels writer/director Brad Siberling's own real-life
experience when his girlfriend was murdered by an obsessive fan.  But most
importantly, almost every part of this movie feels natural in its emotions
and storytelling, not the result of some sentimental hackjob put together by
a big studio.  Siberling's intent is to portray a normal family dealing with
life, loss, and love and whatever obstacles may come their way and he does a
fine job of it.

There are moments Moonlight Mile doesn't entirely ring true, but those
moments are glossed over by the acting.  From Gyllenhaal to Ellen Pompeo to
Dustin Hoffman and Susan Sarandon, the cast is uniformly superb.  Even
though the climax is set in a courtroom (typically the setting for cliche
hell in dramas), Gyllenhaal's emotional outpour makes the scene work almost
magnificently.   

An admittedly very irksome element of the film is the score, which is yet
again another rip-off of the music to American Beauty.  Moonlight Mile's
straightforward, honest approach doesn't match the quirky tone of the score,
resulting in a few off-kilter moments of balance.  But otherwise, this is a
first-rate, truthful drama, and certainly superior to the overrated and
similary themed In the Bedroom.
<|_=00=_|>
When I first started watching this movie I was a bit confused. I had
expected some drama and romance, but instead it looked like a comedy!
But when I kept watching, I realised I was wrong, although I have to
admit that the first half an hour is rather comedy than drama.

Anyway, "Moonlight Mile" is highly enjoyable. What exactly makes this
movie so great? It's the acting. The cast is outstanding. Susan
Sarandon and Dustin Hoffman are truly amazing as always. Jake
Gyllenhaal, who we know from "Donnie Darko", was excellent as well.
But, like I already said, Hoffman and Sarandon are the true stars in
this one. They were both so funny from time to time! "Moonlight Mile"
is definitely worth watching! A true indie with great performances!

8/10
<|_=00=_|>

This is an absolute gem of a movie. The script is absolutely delicious, the
acting out-standing and to put it bluntly, this film is
brilliant.

Joe Nast's (Gyllenhaal) world suddenly becomes very claustrophobic when his
fiance, Diana, is shot dead. Now Joe is stuck in Diana's child-hood home
with her two grieving parents; Jo-Jo (Sarandon) and Ben (Hoffman) who both
deal with their loss in very different ways. Ben wants to keep moving, not
slow down long enough to feel the pain of it all while Jo-Jo just lets her
emotions run rampant. 
Joe, meanwhile, doesn't know what to do with himself. Does he stay in the
small town, and go into commercial real-estate with Diana's father? Or does
he leave, and find out what he wants to do? 
The second choice becomes increasingly tempting when Joe meets local
waitress and postal-employee, Bertie (Pompeo), who is dealing with the loss
of her own loved one, Cal, who left for Vietnam 3 years ago and doesnt look
to ever be coming back. Joe and Bertie reluctantly fall for each other, and
the relationship and trial of Diana's murderer propels Joe to confront all
of his battling emotions and release a secret he's been desperately trying
to communicate to Jo-Jo and Ben.

Gyllenhaal, Sarandon, Hoffman and even new-comer Pompeo are absolutely
magnificent. There is a comedic twist in Moonlight Mile, which they all play
very well, but know when to shift gears and tug the audience's heart
strings. Each deliver a beautiful performance with the help of director and
writer Brad Silberling, a genius who you should be sure to be on the look
out for.

I have read some real hair-pulling comments about this remarkable film. Some
people have seriously bagged the hell out of it. But these are the same
people who couldnt even realize where they pulled the title 'moonlight mile'
from. For those idiots, it came from Bertie's song 'Moonlight Mile' by the
Rolling Stones that Joe plays on the jukebox.

Dont be fooled. This film can appear slow at times, but if you stick with
it, you realize that every single sentence, every solitary scene, has a
deeper meaning. Take the symbolism of the 'watches' for example. This is a
smart film, dont expect to just sit there and not have to do any thinking-
absorb it, cheesy as it sounds, it truly is magnificent. appreciate
moonlight mile, dont just write it off like some loser's
have.

This movie is undeniably an emotional twister ride, but it makes you want
to
ride it again.  This movie has a similar theme to In The Bedroom.
Imagine a
movie that deals with death as a part of life, grief with comfort in
others,
anger of loss.  Imagine a movie that deals with relationships between
strangers and family, love and hate.  Imagine the struggle between
accountability and being hurtful, living your life for someone else to
help
them and fulfilling your desires......now imagine that the movie is not
the
waste of time In the Bedroom was and you've got THE MOONLIGHT MILE.
(does
this speech remind you of Matthew McConaughey in A Time To Kill?  I hope
so)

OK.  This movie is fantastic.  It is worth seeing.  It has Susan
Sarandon's
best performance since Dead Man Walking.  Dustin Hoffman is steady as a
rock
throughout and Jake Gyllenhaal seems as if he stumbles into nailing the
role
perfectly.  And Ellen Pompeo is such a natural beauty.  This is a much
more
upbeat way of dealing with the only guarantee in life (which is death)
than
in the bedroom, city of angels (which is also done by brad siberling) or
anything else I've seen recently.  It is very real and honest and not
enough
movies can be this way....deeply depressing for moments, hopeful for
others,
and times where you're not sure how they'll react.  But everything fits.
It
has a great script and the soundtrack is really fitting for the movie.
I'm
not sure what the hell the user Li-1 was talking about when he said this
movie's soundtrack was a ripoff of American Beauty....NONE OF THE SONGS
ARE
THE SAME EINSTEIN!!!
I'm giving this movie a 10/10 even though it's really a 9/10 because
other
people leaving reviews are not rating it accurately.

RENT THIS MOVIE.  WATCH IT TWICE.

She adds total believability as the mother of the murdered daughter. 
***Minor spoilers***There was loads to like in this movie, but Jake
Gyllenhaal's performance was not one of them, unfortunately. His likeness to
Tobey Maguire distracts me and also there was not much to his dialogue in
this, he sat, reacted and stared emotionally a lot, which I have seen him do
in other movies. Maybe he just has a one note performance that he totes
around from movie to movie. He has one brilliant scene however, and this one
is not the one in the courtroom that some reviewers loved.  This is a scene
at a dinner party and it is beautifully scripted and timed. Dustin Hoffman
was very good in his role and I really liked how everything was so
beautifully understated. Dabney Coleman in a small role was wonderful. I
also loved how the compassion and need between Joe and Bertie was managed
but I did not like the resolution at the end, I felt cheated. How many words
had Bertie and Joe exchanged to make the possibility of a relationship
credible ? The lust I can understand, the shared grief also, but "a drop
everything and take off together" ending was the easy way out for the script
writer for it seems that is what we demand in our movies today.  7 out of
