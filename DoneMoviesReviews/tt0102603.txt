This got some of the best reviews of any recent Stallone film, and after
seeing it, I understand why. It's an absolutely hilarious, wonderful
movie
that shows one of Sly's best performances, and a great supporting cast.
It
was a long time before I got around to seeing it, but man, am I glad I
did.
I haven't laughed this much in a long time. And to those of you who jump
on
the negative hype bandwagon and make fun of Stallone like a bunch of
lemmings, check this one out.

Excellent timing, a fantastic cast, great soundtrack... actually,
everything
about this movie is terrific. It centers around mixed (and missed)
messages,
so a lot of it depends upon timing and straight delivery. These are
accomplished in a major way.

The main center of the comedy, the valise, gets treated in a way that gets
a
bit old, but overall, I can't get tired of this movie. Stallone does such
fantastic comedy and has such an exquisite sense of timing and delivery,
it's a wonder anybody lets him do action movies. He missed his calling.
Look
for Ornella Muti (Princess Aura from "Flash Gordon") as the superb,
dignified, and fiery-tempered Sophia, as Snaps' wife and source of fear
for
the entire cast, and Tim Curry as Dr. Poole, in a genius turn as a
mild-mannered professor discovering love for the first time. It's a fairly
obscure movie, but if you get the chance to see it, do treat
yourself.

I just love to see Sylvester playing anything else but macho studs, and in
this movie he does and doesn't if you catch my drift. I think his portrayal
of a godfather going straight is fantastic and the whole movie had me in
hysterics more than once, fun stuff.!!

If you love Sly, if you love comedy, if you love gangster films, then this
one's for you! It's got all that & more! Marisa Tomei playing Sly's
daughter?? It works! The beautiful Italian import, Ornella Muti playing
Sly's wife? It works! Chazz Palminteri playing a hood yet once again? That
always works! Whatcha got here is 1 Mob Boss (the ever-elegant Sly) tryin'
to go straight 'cuz he promised his dying father (Kirk Douglas's cameo),
cops who just won't buy it, bankers who can't stand it, a mix-up with "a
little black bag", a search for a husband for Sly's daughter, an annoying
accountant who skims $$$ off the top to marry Sly's "other daughter, the
one
that's not Lisa", & this all happens in ONE MORNING!! Ya gotta feel sorry
for the guy! How can he cope? He does it - just as Sly as he can be, too!

Buy this one if you can still find it. It's a comedy of 'great ethnic
proportions'!

Personally, I love this film.

You look past the Syvester Stallone attempt at comedy, you're left with a
neat fast paced funny film that'll make you laugh. How many things can go
wrong and backfire between 8am and 12noon? Well, there's 3 possible
husbands
for a pregnant daughter who isn't pregnant. One of whom wants to marry the
father's other daughter who isn't his daughter............don't even get
me started on the 3 bags of money/jewels/knickers.

I could watch this film over and over again. In fact - I
have.

Oh I know, Sylvester Stallone in an urbane period farce?  Impossible, you
say?  No sir!  He's actually very funny - as is the script (adapted from
the
play) and all the supporting cast!  I totally love this movie and I show
it
to everyone I meet, despite their initial reactions - and they all enjoy
it!
Tim Curry is priceless as always and it's also Marisa Tomei's first
movie.
Vincent Spano, Peter Reigert, Yvonne de Carlo, Don Ameche, Kirk Douglas,
Chazz Palminteri - more!  It's so awesome!

I am very selective about the movies I buy for my personal library, and
this
one passed. The whole movie takes place between 8:30 a.m. and 12:00 noon,
and the twists and complications never stop. It's packed with memorable
one-liners and hilarious images: former hit-men being butlers and making
fruit salad, a linguist (Tim Curry) whose unsolicited grammar corrections
keep getting misunderstood, the melodramatic daughter (Marisa Tomei) of a
gangster named after a cheese.

Few movies carry this many successive gut laughs. It's quite an ab
workout.
It's also comparitively clean&mdash;five or six swear words and some
allusions to premarital pregnancy and activities. I highly recommend
it.

This movie was a great one you can laugh really hard and not care who's
around.  If the words "Yes Boss"  don't get you laughing then i don't know
what will.  Tim Curry is notorious for comedy or just being a bad guy in
alot of movie but he did an excellent job in this movie with slyvester
Stallone.  This movie has alot of laughter great characters and a really
good unique story line that you don't see very often.  Yes indeed the story
get's a little confusing but you can't help but love the era of the movie
and the way everyone's does so well with their characters.  Recommended for
a movie night or just for a few good laughs! ~!

This is maybe one of the best comedies I have seen. The whole story is
nothing much, but the actors made it it unforgettable. The thing that
makes this movie so good is the cast, the actors are really perfectly
chosen and they play it really well. There isn't a one single actor who
doesn't play good in this movie. Well if you expect Stalone to shoot
out crates of ammo, then you will be disappointed. This is the movie
that made me realize that Sylvester Stalone can act not just shoot.
With two words this is a movie to make you laugh. Tip: if you have a
heart condition you probably shouldn't watch this movie without some
medical personal attending.(your heart may burst from laughing)

I'll get the bad stuff out of the way right now: This movie is somewhat
predictable and Sly mugs for the camera too much.

That's it. That's all the bad stuff I could think of to say about this
movie. The rest is all good.

People tend to react with disbelief when they hear about a comedy starring
Sylvester Stallone. While I'm not sure about the range of Sly's comedic
abilities, "Oscar" proves that he CAN do comedy, and given the right part,
can do it very well.

Sly plays Angelo "Snaps" Provolone, a mob boss who promises to his dying
father to give up the crime racket for good. The movie focuses on the
morning in which "Snaps" is preparing to join the ranks of a bank
administration at noon. During that morning, his daughter gets engaged...
three times. She also reveals that she's pregnant... except she's not.
"Snaps" repeatedly loses and regains $100,000 dollars... and a bag of
women's underwear. And then there's his "other" daughter who's not (he
thinks) really his daughter. Behind him all the way are his flunkies,
reduced from robbing banks to scooping melon balls, and incapable of
breaking the habit of calling him "boss" if their lives depended on
it.

Kudos for expert scene theft go to Peter Riegert as the shifty Aldo, Marisa
Tomei as the spoiled brat Lisa Provolone, Martin Ferrero and Harry Shearer
as the Finucci brothers and Tim Curry as the unctuous Dr. Thorntone
Poole.

The critics panned this movie. Rent it anyway and find out just how wrong
they were.
