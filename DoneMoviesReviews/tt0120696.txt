Really surprised at the low rating of this film which as a action
thriller is immensely watchable and re-watchable which for me is the
test of a good film Â– that is bears being seen over and over. It is as
others have said an endlessly inventive thriller with good action and
the idea of a film where all the characters are continuously falling
in, or speeding over floods in tremendous. It is not as others have
said "another heist film" because the environment and opportunity of
the potential crime is different and thought provoking. Doesn't this
gain some extra interest given the Hurricane flooding in the southern
states also? I enjoy Morgan Freeman's portrayal as well as Christian
Slater and Minnie Driver's performances. The old couple is a marvellous
piece of human comedy, well portrayed by both actors. Watch this film
and then . . . watch it again!

Hard Rain is a nifty action thriller, set during the middle of a
titanic flood in a small town in Indiana. Christian Slater plays a
local security guard, attempting to transport the loot out of town with
his partner, but as always, it all goes terribly wrong. On the run,
from a band of determined thieves, led by Morgan Freeman Slater hides
the money and takes refuge with the town sheriff and his band of
officers. Only they're seeing green too and Slater is on his own.

The sodden atmosphere of this film is unique and impressive, as is the
set design. The film is technically very cool, clever too and working
with so much water must've been hell for the crew. The performances are
all well rounded enough in Hard Rain but the script lacks the spark to
truly make this great or memorable. Sure there are some exciting
moments, but what action film doesn't have some excitement? With such a
unique setting, I'm surprised that there just wasn't more of a good
thing. Overall, I enjoyed it. This film is good action flick. Nothing
more, nothing less.

This is a great film that should have made a bigger splash at the box
office. It really isn't just another run of the mil action flick. It's
more of a natural disaster meets crime movie; which make for an
awesomely unique story with one of a kind scenes to take place.
Christian Slater dominates the screen as he does best; I only wish he
was still leading man material instead of getting bit roles. I do admit
there are times when you know what's going to happen before it does but
you do still get some great surprises in there. I love the humor, there
is a lot of it but they don't go over the top with it to where you
can't take the movie serious. Big thumbs up for this underrated film.
Love it!!

Christian Slater plays an armored truck guard who has to deal with
thieves, the crooked police, a fierce Indiana rainfall, and a flooded
town while trying to protect three million dollars in the company
vehicle. Well-done action flick isn't epic-scale, but does have many
suspenseful close-calls and colorful characters, plus good performances
by Slater, Morgan Freeman, Minnie Driver, and Richard Dysart and Betty
White as an elderly couple who didn't evacuate when they were supposed
to. Randy Quaid overplays heinously as a trigger happy sheriff, and the
continual shootouts in the final third get repetitive, but this
scenario (an entire town slowly being submerged) is exceptionally
well-captured and the filmmakers didn't forget to add some good humor
into the mix. **1/2 from ****

If you like action movies, and only action movies, you will like this movie.
Not love it, but you will like it. None of the characters are believable
and some, including Minnie Driver's character, are almost completely
unnecessary. The plot, with just a few twists to keep the viewers interest,
but only minimally, is pretty standard. What saves this movie, however, is
its original action sequences and its setting. The movie takes place during
a giant flood and we learn pretty quickly that water where it shouldn't be
is very entertaining. Simple shootouts aren't just the same when they occur
in 10 feet of water. Even a band of robbers chase the hero into a school
with jet-skis, or crash through a church roof in a boat. These scenes of
mindless action are the only thing that saves this movie from being totally
preposterious crap. At the end you realize that the movie was pretty stupid,
but you enjoyed yourself while it lasted.
<|_=00=_|>

If you are looking for a movie that has some action and is moderately
entertaining without requiring much cerebral activity, this is right up your
street. It suited my purposes at the time I rented it so I quite enjoyed it.
I had heard nothing about it except for the preview I'd seen. Yes, it's no
brilliant piece of movie-making, and no it won't change your life. But it is
fun and entertaining and doesn't claim to be anything else.
(I was pleasantly surprised with Betty White's performance, a long way from
'Golden Girls')

In Huntingburg, the armored truck with three million dollars driven by
Tom (Christian Slater) and his Uncle Charlie (Edward Asner) gets stuck
in the flooding and realizes that the town has been evacuated since the
dam does not have capacity to hold the storm. While waiting for the
National Guard, they are attacked by Jim (Morgan Freeman) and his gang
formed by Kenny (Michael Goorjian), Mr. Mehlor (Dann Florek) and Ray
(Ricky Harris) and the clumsy Kenny kills Charlie. Tom flees with the
bags of money and hides them in the cemetery. Then he is hunted down by
Jim and his gang and he hides in a church. Out of the blue, he is
knocked out and awakes locked in a cell. Soon he learns that the
restorer Karen (Minnie Driver) believed he was a looter and hit him.
Sheriff Mike Collins (Randy Quaid) and Deputy Wayne Bryce (Mark
Rolston) go to investigate Tom' story while Officer Phil (Peter Murnik)
takes Karen out of the town by boat. However she escapes with the boat
and goes to the church. Meanwhile Tom is trapped in the cell full of
water and Karen rescues him. He decides to return to the armored truck
to retrieve a shotgun but he is captured by Jim and his men and learns
that Charlie was part of the gang. He tries to retrieve the hidden
money for the gang, but Sheriff Collins and his men have already taken
it. Soon Tom learns that the Sheriff wants to keep the money for him
and his men and Tom and Karen are witnesses and he teams up with Jim. 

"Hard Rain" is a combination of disaster genre with crime and action.
Despite the negative reviews, the action scenes are spectacular, the
cast is excellent and the plot has a great twist based on the ancient
proverb "the enemy of my enemy is my friend". My vote is six.

Title (Brazil): "Tempestade" ("Storm")

Though Morgan Freeman is an absolute legend, I can't see him being the bad
guy robber at the beginning. After his stellar performance in "The
Shawshank
Redemption," he has left himself too open to being seen by fans as a "nice
guy." True, he did play a convict in that movie, but you never saw him
commit the crime that landed him there. Therefore casting him as an
armoured
car robber didn't sit right with me.

Christian Slater did a "Michael J. Fox" (The Concierge/Secret of My
Success)
by copycatting his own performance in "Broken Arrow" (same screenplay
writer...).

The ending is too abrupt, but, overall, I did enjoy the movie all the same.
For action fans only...

Hard Rain is an action adventure thriller movie. The main thrust of the
plot concerns the efforts of security guard Tom (Christian Slater) to
prevent assorted hoodlums from stealing the money he and his partner
are transporting. The unusual element of this movie is that it takes
place during a deluge which has resulted in extensive flooding, so most
of the action takes place in and around a town which is almost
underwater.

Considering that the main appeal of the movie is the water-based
locations, action and stunts, the film-makers have done quite a good
job in providing a plot with a number of twists, and characters who are
more than cardboard cut-outs. OK, so not much more, admittedly, but
there is still an element of depth to them (the water in town is
deeper)(sorry).

But the semi-aquatic realm in which the movie is set is flawlessly
realised. The main track through town (along which boats race), and the
water-filled interiors of the school, the jail, a church, and assorted
houses - all are absolutely convincing, as is the action which takes
place in them.

This is a very enjoyable movie with a most unusual premise.
<|_=00=_|>
In Mikael Salomon's "Hard Rain", a natural disaster, a heist and a
sheriff who goes rogue, are just a few of the problems that an armoured
truck driver has to contend with when he tries to prevent $3 million in
cash from getting into the wrong hands. His incident-packed story is
told at high speed with shoot-outs, chases and explosions featuring at
various junctures as well as bullets, boats and betrayals providing
further dangers. There's also absolutely no let-up in the level of
threat that he's under as he gets pursued by two very determined groups
of men who are prepared to do whatever it takes in order to steal the
loot and eliminate any witnesses.

When the small town of Huntingburg, Indiana is hit by a torrential
rainstorm and the floodwater starts to rise at an alarming speed,
armoured truck drivers Tom (Christian Slater) and his Uncle Charlie
(Edward Asner) are instructed to collect all the cash held at the
town's banks as a matter of urgency. After completing their collections
and starting to make their way back out of town, the truck gets stuck
in a flooded section of road and Charlie makes a radio call to inform
the National Guard. Almost immediately, they get ambushed by a gang of
four men, one of whom shoots and kills Charlie. Tom then manages to
escape with the bags of money which he subsequently hides in a
cemetery.

The gang, which is led by Jim (Morgan Freeman), pursues Tom until he
gives them the slip and hides out in a local church. There, he gets
knocked unconscious by a woman named Karen (Minnie Driver) who, after
having mistaken him for a looter, takes him to the sheriff's office.
Sheriff Mike Collins (Randy Quaid) believes Tom's account of what had
happened, but as a precaution, locks him up in a cell until his story
can be checked out. The sheriff and his deputies continue to try to
ensure that all the townsfolk are evacuated safely but Karen escapes
from the deputy who'd been instructed to escort her away from danger
and instead goes back to the church (which she'd been restoring), to
fill the pumps.

Soon the huge dam that overlooks Huntingburg is no longer able to fully
retain all its water and Karen rescues Tom from drowning in his cell in
the unattended sheriff's office. The two of them then team up to try
and get away from the extreme danger they're in from the flood and
Jim's gang and the sheriff (who's bitter about not being re-elected to
his post in the recent election) decide to steal the $3 million and
kill anyone who gets in their way.

This movie's special effects, cinematography and well-directed action
sequences are all highly impressive and the acting performances are
also good. The sheer pace of the action ensures that the interest-level
remains high throughout and there are also some humorous moments to
enjoy. "Hard Rain" isn't the kind of movie that would stand up well to
repeat viewings but is nevertheless, full of action that's exciting and
fun to watch.
