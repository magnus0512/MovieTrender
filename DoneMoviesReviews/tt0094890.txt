The original Cocoon was touching, sweet, optimistic, and heartfelt.
Most of the wonderful ensemble cast reunited for this sequel, but
sadly, something went awry.

You learn nothing about what they've seen during five years spent with
the aliens . Further, it seems like everything the characters
accomplished the first time around was repealed in this story. Their
desire to join the aliens in the first place was predicated on a
variety of factors, but each of those reasons is dissected and trashed
this time out. Suddenly, there is conflict and suffering during a brief
one-week visit. Characters get sick, everyone argues, nobody seems
happy. As if that isn't bad enough, a tragic suicide attempt is played
almost like a joke. Since when is suicide funny? Steve Guttenberg's
character was integral to the first movie, but now he's just written as
a clownish buffoon. The grandson's teen angst is annoying.

There are a few notable moments, however. One scene between Jessica
Tandy and Hume Cronyn is deeply touching. The plight of a captured
alien being studied is properly sympathetic. But scenes like these are
intermingled with a menagerie of subplots which dart around between
serious and comedic.

This sequel wanders too far afield from the spirit of its predecessor.
The result is gloomy and disappointing. See the original, instead.

I found this movie to be an unexpected delight! It was engaging well written
and executed, and it left me with a great feeling when it was over! What
more could you ask for? Well how about the endearing performances, and
chemistry between Hume Cronyn, and Jessica Tandy? Not to mention Don Ameche
and Wilford Brimley. All together you have a fine film with many levels of
warmth, and good humor. You'll love it! Watch and  see!

Completely lacking in originality, and even more in unpredictability,
"The Return" gives one the feeling of 'déjà vu', as director Petrie
sticks with the identical formula in order to guarantee success. This
unfortunately also guarantees that we will get no inspiration from this
sequel.

Yet in this light it is well filmed, with each character returning to
fill us with the same emotions as the first "Cocoon" film. Stars Don
Ameche, Wilford Brimley, Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy and Steve Gutenberg
all return among others. James Horner's music is also back to enhance
the mood. Never as good as the first, but never mind.

This is a sequel, and it's better than most sequels. However, most
sequels don't hold up against the original film and this one's no
exception. The same cast is back and the acting is certain up to par in
this film, but the impact of the story isn't there. I believe this film
would have done fairly well had it not been a sequel, but the magic was
gone, sorta like the magic from the pool in the first film. The cast
does a good acting job and they try, they really do, but this film just
doesn't cut the mustard (from whence came THAT expression?) as compared
to the first film. I'm sorry, because I truly liked the first film.
This is overall a very good film and nicely acted, written and
executed. However, as I said, the magic from the first film is just
missing because we knew pretty much what to expect. It's sad that few
sequels are as good as the original.

I had hesitated on watching this sequel because it good bad reviews, but I
really enjoyed it. They had to come back for the cocoons, right? What
makes
this movie worthwhile is that all of the Seniors struggle with whether
they
want to leave Earth again. Immortality isn't all it's cracked up to be.

<|_=00=_|>
After I enjoyed the first Cocoon so much I decided that the sequel
could not be too bad. For the most part, the Cocoon: The Return remains
a generally enjoyable film even if most of the magic remained in the
original. In this one, the elderly friends return back to earth to
catch up on everything that had missed out on while they were away. The
biggest problem when they get back to earth is that all of the special
protection from illness and aging that they had with the aliens
eventually wears off, and if they don't get back to their planet with
the aliens quickly, some of them may die. Overall, an enjoyable and
harmless sequel to the original. If you liked the original you will
most likely enjoy this sequel. ***1/2 out of *****.
<|_=00=_|>
There is certainly an argument as to whether Cocoon: The Return need
have ever been made. Ben (Wilford Brimley) had explicitly told his
grandson that he would never see him again, it serves to cheapen that
scene and many other scenes of finality in the original that they
'return' for this sequel.

Another annoyance is that the hospitals and doctors that the oldsters
frequent don't seem to wonder how the hell these guys have risen
seemingly from the dead.

That said, it's wonderful to see the senior actors return again, and
some very real issues are covered which make this more than a
worthwhile sequel all things considered. The scene of sacrifice with
Joe (Hume Cronyn) and Alma (Jessica Tandy) is a whirlpool of emotion
and I defy anyone not to be moved by this pair of stunning performances
- it really does tug on the heartstrings, as much as anything in the
first movie does. It's also superb watching Bernie (Jack Gilford) move
on with his life by dating the feisty Ruby (Elaine Stritch) who is more
than a match for the cantankerous curmudgeon. Some brilliantly moving
moments as Bernie believes he is betraying his late wife by kissing
another woman...

And that's what the Cocoon movies do, they move you, they move senior
citizens - disregarded by society - to the forefront of importance and
rightfully so too, before we were around - they were. They deserve
these films to showcase the hardships they have to go through in later
life, where a great deal of them to crave immortality...these films
take a look what if?...and then...is it what it was cracked to be.

Wonderful films, wonderful actors - I'll defend these movies to the
end.

   ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***
This movie got really bad reviews... but I think it's almost just as good
as
the first one!  Sure... it hasn't got the BEST plot in the world... but
the
cute older people return!  That's enough to make me watch it!  (Note: Bit
of
a spoiler coming up here... but not TOO in depth)  Wilford Brimley and
Maureen Stapleton again do a fine job as they contemplate whether to stay
with their beloved daughter and grandson, or to return to the planet of
Antarea.  Jack Gilford again shines... this time with Elaine Stritch!
Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn give an especially moving performance as his
leukemia returns... and she's hit by a car.  (VERY depressing point in the
movie... it'll bring tears to your eyes)  And, saving the best for last,
Gwen Verdon and Don Ameche... again, bringing a sparkle to their parts and
doing a wonderful job!  (I must say though... it's kind of weird that they
made Bess pregnant.... considering Gwen was 63 and all at the time...)  A
definite must see... but only after you've seen the first!

Sequels are usually not as good as the original, unless the sequel
happens to be called "Godfather II," so "Cocoon: The Return" is no
exception. On the other hand, I didn't find it ghastly (though a few
others on this board did). It has the same terrific cast, which
includes Don Ameche, Jack Gilford, Maureen Stapleton, Gwen Verdon, with
the addition of Elaine Strich in the old folks' department, and Tawnee
Welch, Tyrone Power Jr., and Steve Guttenberg with the addition of a
very young Courtney Cox in the young folks' department. Brian Dennehy
makes a brief appearance at the end of the film.

The Anterians need to return to pick up some cocoons, so the old folks
come back to catch up with friends and family, with some interesting
results.

Another plot concerns scientists taking one of the cocoons and studying
it, while the Anterians attempt to rescue it before it's too late.

The movie actually has some very sweet moments - it probably would have
been lousy without the same cast, but they're all very likable.

Okay, not great, and anyone under 55 probably won't want to be
bothered. By the way, I cried during some of it. Guess my age.
<|_=00=_|>
The original Cocoon, with its heartwarming concept that advancing years
need not doom one to an inevitable decline, is completely betrayed in
this maudlin, pointless sequel.

Cocoon depicted a lovable cast of lively but sickly seniors not willing
to go quietly into the night. Cocoon: The Return expects us to believe
that this same intrepid group are actually homesick for hot dogs, night
clubs, and dress shopping. We are "treated" to endless depictions of
seniors enjoying the senior retirement "scene" ... the very "scene"
from which they fled in the original.

The direction was aimless, and the editing totally lacking. The script
stilted and wholly unbelievable, the acting truly bad ... although to
be fair I am not sure the actors can be blamed for this.
