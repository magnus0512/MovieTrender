After leaving the James Bond franchise in 1971, Sean Connery gave a
number of notable performances in films such as The Offense and The Man
Who Would Be King but Outland is really the film that started him on
the comeback trail that culminated with his Oscar acceptance speech 6
yrs later for The Untouchables. No one seems to recall this but at the
time of Outland's release, no one had seen or heard from Connery for a
few years and most of the reviews, while not kind to the film for a
variety of reasons--chief among them being the fact that most movie
critics (at least back then) harbored serious prejudice against sci
fi--the main comment was "It is good to see Sean Connery back in action
again".

This film has one of the best production designs ever.Phillip Harrison
did a superb job. Obviously the look was copped from Alien--blue collar
workers in space--but it works remarkably well. I was often reminded of
OUTLAND during my seven year prison term; the housing was remarkably
similar--as was the company. But I digress...

Nothing special about the plot-- it's routine cop show or western movie
stuff--but who cares? Sean Connery gives a splendid performance and the
whole film moves at a nice clip. Very enjoyable.

Sean Connery. A man's man, a woman's sex symbol. Good start! Now let's put
him on a remote moon of Jupiter. So how many other films have Io as their
center of action? Absolutely excellent in combining the effects that were
available at the time with a darn good plot. Well overshadowed by the likes
of Alien, this is late 70's/ early 80's sci-fi at it's best. No more is the
future in space a Utopia, it is a grimy, nasty everyday world where people
carry on their sordid business as they ever did. Except there is always a
hero; a flawed hero, as is Connery. A personal crusade, a battle almost
against the odds (but not unbelievably so, at all) and the true hallmark of
a good sci-fi story: That is, the story would work just as well anywhere,
any place, any time, as it does in space in the future. What more do you
want (Just check out the shuttle landing)? Essential viewing!

The movie is amazingly realistic in regard to the technology used and
in regard to the human characters.

I totally agree with OP Voutilainen, who wrote a very good comment on
this movie on 24 October 2001.

The movie is never superficial if you look at its characters: The bad
are not simply bad but realistically brutal. The good are not simply
heroic, they rather strive to survive and struggle to keep what's left
of their personal dignity and values after the school of life.

People of the future will possibly wonder why anyone ever liked such a
"normal life"-movie. The answer is: Simply because of the everyday life
dignity that people emanate in the movie.

Really a great positive movie !

What a great movie! Outland is without a doubt one of the best sci-fi movies
ever made.Or perhaps sci-fi is the wrong term for this one, because where's
the fiction? Everything is so realistic.No monsters,no gizmos-just space and
man.

 Mood is just right,nothing looks too good.Mining community is dirty and
dangerous,people are deceitful. Models and sets haven't really aged at
all.They were once accurately made,and beat computer effects 6-0.

Connery acts well and Peter Boyle's role as a twisted manager fits him.  All
in this movie could well occur in the future,and this is the fact which
makes it so enjoyable.I'll give 9/10

In the near-future, in a space mine set on the Jupiter satellite Io, the
new
Marshall O'Niel (Sean Connery) discovered a mortal drug trafic. This
amphetamine-like drug drives the addicted miners mad and makes them
committed suicide. O'Niel encovers the conspiracy, involving the director
of
the mine, but becomes the target of hitmen, with almost no body helping
him.
The film is a Science Fiction remake of "High Noon"("le train sifflera
trois
fois" in French). The train is here replaced by a shuttle from a space
station and the Far West by the set on a deep space mining outpost (Not
Deep
Space Nine).

This a well paced film with a solid acting from Sean Connery. The
pursuits,
especialy the first in the corridors of the space habitat, are gripping.
The
film was made in 1981, when the CGI effects were not as prevalent as
today.
For exemple scenes where humans are dwarfed by huge metalic structures,
were
executed thanks to a then traditional play of mirrors.
I have seen this film at the cinema when it played for the first time in
1981. I have recently watched it again on cable TV and I think it has not
aged much. Because it is set on a makeshift sleazy outpost and not a shiny
white place as too often in science fiction film, it remains realistic
enough, twenty two years later. The themes,a bit overlooked, dangerous
mind
drugs, greedy multinational (or multi-planet, here) companies, the will
and
courage of one man against the cowardice of all the others, resonate still
in our mind, nowadays. But make no mistake, it not a heavy political film
but a good suspense and action film with a science fiction
flavour.

Despite some scientific oddities like heads exploding and weightlessness
in
a zero pressure atmosphere, where as inside the habitat the gravity is
normal (by Earth standards), the script remains coherent enough. The
strong
performance of Sean Connery is helped by those of a serious Peter Boyle
and
a pre-ER Frances Sternhagen. Rent this film on your local video store or
watch it on TV, it is worth seeing it.

Both in the Citadel Film Series book The Films of Sean Connery and a
quick survey of the user comments here, everyone seems to be conceding
that Outland is simply High Noon transferred to outer space. It's not
really, but there are certain plot similarities. Of course there were
enough similarities that Fred Zinneman stated that Peter Hyams had
ripped off his western classic.

For one thing Gary Cooper is a newlywed in High Noon, Sean Connery is a
married man with a 12 year old son. His wife however wants him to give
up the futuristic law enforcement business, but it's what he knows and
because he's such an independent minded fellow who speaks his mind he
gets one garbage assignment after another.

Here he's on a mining colony on the Jupiter satellite Io. It's a
frontier town, not unlike some in the west. But Hadleyburg in High Noon
is passed the wild and woolly frontier days and the impending gunfight
is not wanted because it will bring those days back. Gary Cooper dealt
with ingratitude, what Connery is dealing with on Io is systemic
corruption.

The boss of the place is Peter Boyle the head of mining operations. One
of the things he provides are illegal synthetic narcotics which make
the men work like mules and increase his productivity. They also
eventually fry your brain and you turn paranoid. 

Connery notices several suspicious deaths have occurred in the past two
years after he's had to deal with some miners who've gone haywire. The
presence of narcotics is confirmed by station doctor Frances Sternhagen
during an autopsy. 

When Boyle's confronted with this, bribery doesn't work so he puts out
a contract on Connery. His deputies are all on the pad and the miners
won't help either. His one friend in the place is Sternhagen.

In fact acting honors in Outland go to Frances Sternhagen as the tough
old bird of a doctor who's also in a kind of exile on Io. 

Outland has good special effects and the mining colony on Io is
marvelously created with the use of miniatures, much like the Himalayas
were in Black Narcissus. But it is better known for a good story and
some fine acting by all, especially Sternhagen. It's one of Sean
Connery's better films and shouldn't be missed by science fiction fans
or Sean Connery's many fans.

So what if it took a few bites out of High Noon.

I first watched this movie not expecting much as i had never really
heard much about it and it didn't seem to be particularly acclaimed,
but I was pleasantly surprised by it, Connery's performance is solid
and the rest of the cast do a good job, there are some exciting scenes
in this movie and the settings (outer space,mining colony) are
convincing enough to keep you emersed in the story, the story is like a
western in space, (which is about all I heard of this before I saw
it),though its not particularly original and doesn't try to be
spectacular, it is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours and
good fun for Connery fans to see him kicking arse back in the days.

<|_=00=_|>

Outland is brilliant. So many good moments in the movie -the first time you
see someones head explode from change of pressure, the bloodied elevator as
it returns from the bottom of the mining shaft and the overall excellent
visionary style of the mining colony. Connery is perfectly cast as the
marshall who cannot be bought and Frances Sternhagen brings much needed
warm
relief from the terror with her smart, down-to-earth manner. Hyams directs
the film with excellent vigour and his choice of filters and lighting,
(especially the scene in the prostitues room which is blood red from the
emergency lighting), gives an instant impression of heat, fear and so cool
relief from the space shots. It could quite easily be overlooked as just
another sci-fi flick but I think it established much more the benefits of
bringing earth-realism to outer-space than any other film in it's
day.(Probably best to watch it, as I did, when you are 10 years
old!!)

I remember wanting to see this when it came out in '81, on the heels of
sci-fi classics such as 'Star Wars', 'Alien', and 'The Empire Strikes Back'.
Of course because of its 'R' rating I could never see it until it came out
on video. I found it offered a different take on sci-fi films as it had no
involvement with sinister aliens, and the only alien world explored is the
Jupiter moon.

***WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!***

'Outland' is set on Io, one of Jupiter's moons, in a mining colony. Marshal
W.T. O'Niel (Connery) is assigned to the moon colony. Shortly after he
arrives he discovers that several miners have been committing suicide in
bizarre and ugly ways, such as walking into zero-atmosphere minus a pressure
suit. When he investigates he finds that the dead men have been taking an
amphetamine-like drug. According to Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen) the
drug enables the miners to go for days without sleep and work at extended
intervals, thereby increasing the mine's productivity. When O'Niel follows
the dealers' trail he discovers that it leads to the head of the mining
operation. These men have no intention of letting O'Niel stop their dirty
work, and now the marshal has to watch his back at every turn, as a hit
contract is put out on his head. O'Niel also finds that his own men are
willing to turn on him...

***END SPOILER ALERT***

Like someone else mentioned, the production design does not show space as a
shiny, clean environment - space is 'dirty' here. The mining colony looks
like a real operation, in a similar way to the way the Nostromo appeared in
'Alien'. Jerry Goldsmith's music also sounds much like the low, sinister
tones of 'Alien' which he had written only 2 years before. While it lacks
most of the spectacular effects of the 'Star Wars' trilogy it gives a
believable sense of the awesome size of space. The story is not unlike a
western set in outer space, only that the crime the marshal is trying to
stop is drug-dealing as opposed to train or stagecoach robbery. Not a bad
movie, not on the scale of 'Star Wars' or 'Alien' but definitely worth
looking into.

What an entertaining movie this is. The plot is believable; the acting,
from the minor characters right up to and including the leads, is
excellent; the dialogue is natural and realistic (and intelligible);
and the special effects have aged well and are quite good, as good as
today's CGI stuff. But unlike today's sf movies, it's not the f/x that
play the central role here but rather plot, character, and acting.

I can understand some of the comments about some of the movie's
science, particularly in the way earth gravity suddenly appears inside
buildings and the way people's cranial cavities literally expand like
balloons when exposed to near zero pressure, but none of that is
central. I'm pleased when I see real science in movies (maybe surprised
would be a better term), but if I want science I can read a textbook.
Anyway, this shortfall is more than made up for by having a doctor in
the movie named Lazarus - over scientific accuracy I'll take a little
humor. Or good dialogue, such as when O'Neil, having just chased a perp
through half the installation, finally corners him in a kitchen, gets
the drop on him, and leveling his shotgun at his desperate kitchen
knife-wielding opponent says to him, 'Think it over'.

Comparisons have been made to other movies like High Noon and sf
classics like Alien and 2001. I'll leave 2001 go at least until I can
figure out how that giant fetus got out there in outer space, but as to
Alien, well, in my view Outland compares quite well despite Alien's
iconic status. Alien conveys all the niceness of a vat of sulfuric
acid. What a bunch of dismal characters inhabited that movie. Outland
has a different feel to it and portrays more than a few positive human
characteristics (the interaction between O'Neil and his wife is quite
affecting although, or maybe because, it takes place via a video
screen). And as to this being a 'remake' of High Noon set in outer
space, well, it really isn't. In fact there's only one aspect of the
plot that is similar (the first half of Outland is a whodunit), though
the device of periodically showing a clock to countdown when the bad
guys will arrive is of course an obvious imitation. Someone else said
that this movie is actually a 'western', and that's true if you mean a
movie with a real hero who stands virtually alone despite the odds on
the side of right vs. wrong (though he does get a little help
especially from one particular rather brave woman). Basically though,
this is just a very good movie that makes good use of and occasionally
even exceeds the limits of its genre. It's got plenty of action and
suspense and not a single dead spot. It's worth seeing.
