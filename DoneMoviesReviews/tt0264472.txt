When `Changing Lanes' first opens, the viewer is presented with a montage
of
jagged credits, trendy jerking photography cruising NYC streets, and
electronic beats that are so cool they could be used for cryogenic
freezing.
It quickly seems apparent that this film is simply a star-vehicle for Ben
Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson; it seems apparent that this is a cold and
impersonal genre-exercise for a successful comedy director, Roger Michell
(`Notting Hill'), to branch out; it seems to be all these things until the
end of this sequence when the camera glances out the window of a school bus
out onto the New York City skyline, and there we see it: the World Trade
Center. Unlike Sam Raimi's upcoming `Spider-Man', delayed after September
11th so that the WTC could be digitally removed, this is a film unafraid to
date itself, and unafraid to look at human truth.

Affleck plays the role of the oddly named Gavin Banek (did they take the
name Ben Affleck', throw it in a blender, and add some new letters for
good
measure?), a high-power lawyer on the verge of becoming one of the partners
at his law firm, alongside his father-in-law. Jackson is Doyle Gibson, a
reforming alcoholic father of two clawing his way out of his hole and
trying
to save his marriage. On a critical day in both their lives, Doyle going to
court to try winning joint-custody, and Gavin on his way to seal his
career-making case, the two get into a minor accident on the FDR turnpike,
causing Doyle to miss his hearing and Gavin to accidentally give Doyle a
signed document that is critical to his case and it all unravels from
there.

The two tumble in a daylong haze of malice and self-destruction,
sabotaging
each other's lives. Whenever either decides to throw in the towel and do
the
right' thing, it is too late and the other has already escalated it to the
next level. His life quickly falling down around him, Gavin begins to
examine it for the first time, taking a deep look into his wife, his law
firm, his boss/father-in-law, and himself ultimately questioning his
motivation for trying to retrieve the document in the first
place.

This is where the film really shines: many movies ask the question what
makes a man?' but `Changing Lanes' does it with honestly and authenticity.
The screenplay, by Chap Taylor, asks if it is success, or if its providing
for one's wife and kids, or if its true goodness, avoiding superficiality
and delving into the motivations for each. In one telling monologue,
Gavin's
father-in-law, played with perfect tone by Sydney Pollack, says, `At the
end
of the day, I do more good than harm. What other standard have I got?'
Unfortunately, the movie does not really ask the question of what makes a
woman, even though both wives show real strength. The movie does not even
seem to suggest that Gavin and Doyle's struggles could even be applied to
women (obviously they could, had the movie explored that).

Jackson, always an excellent actor, is great as Gibson even if he has
performed better before. Surprisingly, in this film Affleck's acting
actually seems to surpass Jackson's in this amazing performance that is
probably the best we have seen from Affleck so far.

All of the characters in the film, including minor-roles and extras, all
exhibit a very human feel, and seeing real-feeling people on the screen has
always been something rare and not to be taken for granted. The viewer
comes
to care about everyone in the picture: Gavin, Doyle, their wives, the guy
at
the bank, even the stranger at the bar.

New York City itself is alive in this movie: it breathes, coughs, and gasps
with Salvatore Totino's shaky, unsaturated, claustrophobic photography.
Totino really looks at people and the city in the face, and does not try to
make them prettier or uglier than they are. David Arnold's original
electronic score is a refreshing change from the very poor attempts at
orchestral music that most movies are now filled with. Arnold's score very
effectively sets the mood and reinforces the tempo of the
movie.

`Changing Lanes' is a success for Roger Michell that shows us that a movie
can have major stars, be entertaining, glossy, substantial, and pensive
all-at-once.

`Changing Lanes' is rated R for a fender-bender, destruction of office
equipment, unseen infidelity, a shot of the World Trade Center, and honest
depiction of the human condition.

This movie was surprisingly good, for many reasons. The most obvious is
probably that the characters develop before, during, and after the
presented story, as the film opens at a critical time for both of them
and closes with them having changed major parts in their lives.

I expected this to be a glorified version of Madd's Spy vs. Spy, or
something of that nature, given the hype. However, it is not at the
same pace at all... the violence is not cartoonish, its realistic. The
characters are not simple, they are complex. They "have issues" and are
both trying to find a better sense of balance in their lives, both do
things which they regret... all in all, this is one of the most "human"
movies I've ever watched.

Even though the characters are deep, the movie does not try to emphasis
it with drawn out scenes with dramatic music or anything, which
actually makes it more like watching real people than watching a movie.
It also makes for a more powerful effect overall because it is up to
the watcher to notice the subtleties.

The acting and directing are very well done, and there is some writing
which surprised me in that it showed more about the characters rather
than relating directly to the main conflict (I don't want to give too
much detail and spoil it). The pacing is good and kept me interested
throughout, partially to see what the main characters would do next and
partially to see what, if anything, they would learn from the
experience.

It is not as "epic" as something like Shawshank Redeption, and doesn't
deal with esoteric themes such as Meet Joe Black or ominous themes such
as Equilibirum or 1984(the novel), but in a way it is more epic because
it deals with normal people who struggle to be beneficial humans
despite major mistakes, pressures, and conflicts.
<|_=00=_|>

Now, I'm not going to slap this movie on my Top 10 list or say it deserves
an Oscar nod, like many critics have exclaimed, but I will say it's
something different.  First of all, it's real.  Not an artificial
Hollywood
shoot 'em up or disaster flick.  This is a film about the human struggle.
There's no violence or sex, and if it weren't for about 7 uses of the "f"
word "Changing Lanes" could've easily earned a PG-13.  So don't let the
R-rating fool you.

There are three main reasons why I checked out this movie:  Samuel, L,
Jackson.  Needless to say, he's a terrific actor and worth seeing in
whatever he does.  He's one of my favorites, and he delivers another
powerhouse performance, taking on a role somewhat different from his
recent
roles:  he plays an average Joe.  We're introduced to his character, Doyle
Gibson, who's a very nice guy simply haunted by mistakes in his past, one
being alcoholism, which led to a divorce.  And now he's attending AA
meetings and buying a house for his two kids, hoping he will attain
custody
of them.  Ben Affleck is good and charismatic.  I didn't sympathize as
much
with his character, but that doesn't make him an antagonist.  Neither
characters are saints, nor are they sinners.  That's good, because it's
never completely effective to include characters who are entirely
sympathetic.  They're both mature adults, but they resort to juvenile acts
of revenge in hopes that they can undo what happened.  Sydney Pollack is
great, as Affleck's egotistical father-in-law, proving his talents in
front
of the camera are just as fine as his talents behind the camera.  I wanted
to see more of the beautiful Amanda Peet, but she only has approximately 7
minutes of screen time.  So I'm guessing that topless scene I heard
mentioned didn't make it to the final cut.  Oh, well.  William Hurt, who
seems to do a movie every 5 years, unfortunately has a small, thankless
role
as an alcohol counselor.

The script is well-written, and the film is a lot more character-driven
than
ones of recent years.  I loved that scene in the bar where Sam Jackson
sits
in a lonely bar, listening in on two white guys badmouthing Tiger Woods.
He
lashes back with a terrific monologue, and later ends up punching them
out.
Some directors would've cut that scene out, overly concerned about the
film's pacing, but I'm glad this time that wasn't the case.  However, the
ending seems a little fake.  It's just too happy for its own good.  But
that's the only element of the movie I found forced.

My score:  7 (out of 10)

Spoilers.

Changing Lanes is much more complex than the trailer leads you to
believe. From the preview, you'd think it is an action fan's
over-revved, simple-minded revenge thriller with lots of vehicular
mayhem. Believe it or not, it does more peeling back of the layers of
insulation of the affluent/powerful end of the social spectrum than any
film I have seen lately. (--And not in the way the disappointingly
too-pat-to-downright-absurd 'John Q' did, either.)

It's a film noir, and one of the darkest at that, full of despair,
cynicism and scathing revelations about human nature. It seems to say--
or really, and this is a major distinction, to be about characters some
of whom believe-- that we all make deals of personal expedience with
Morality, that no one escapes life formation uncompromised and
therefore able to comment on or judge anyone else's choices or actions.
It's the old amoral, nihilistic/relativistic universe routine, which
says concepts of fairness, justice or morality are quaintly irrelevant,
that stuff just keeps happening, always has and always will, que sera
sera.

My favorite scene, which was revolting and ugly and creepy as anything
in any horror film you can name, is when Affleck sits down in a fine
restaurant to discuss with his wife the morality of the situation he
has been sucked into and is getting in deeper by the hour. He
recognizes rightly that his game of oneupmanship, and win-at-any-cost
has gotten insanely out of control. He is beginning to question it all,
everything in his life. He comes to his wife for solace, direction,
insight, a hint of moral rectitude, any help she can offer. She helps
him, alright-- by saying she knows he does dishonest things (like
having an affair with a woman at the office, which up until she springs
that, he thought was his little secret) and that she could have had an
honest husband, if that was all she wanted. --Why would she make a
scene over an infidelity and risk interrupting the flow of her
resources, anyway, she asks. He splits the dinner, dazed and even more
desperate. In the next scene we witness him doing more of those very
things he has just been having moral anguish over. (Maybe he can't
recognize the feel of moral anguish at first.)

The Affleck character has a tremendous amount at stake, courtesy a
pretty nifty plot hook, that keeps him up to some very dirty tricks.
Sure, he doesn't want to risk interrupting the flow of his resources,
either. But I think it's clear that the real reason he keeps doing
crummy things is because he is a man compulsively drawn to the rewards
of a destructive mode of behavior. Others gamble or drink or eat too
much. Affleck works the system, lying, cheating, and treating all
people like garbage. That's his high, his inescapable need. He can't
quit. (Late in the film, he agrees to hire an idealistic young intern
because, he laughs uncontrollably to himself, he wants to see what the
intern's optimism and altruism looks like after 5 years of hard
weathering by his no-rules-in-life employer.) Affleck is sick, and
while he finally recognizes that sickness, he resigns himself to keep
doing the same thing because, as his boss tells himself, he is willing
to believe he has done more good than harm at the end of the day. The
Affleck character's motivations for being extra bad, in the episode of
his life we glimpse here, are strong enough to keep Changing Lanes from
being just another American psycho study; it's easy to believe we could
turn Affleck, given a similar circumstance in our life.

The ending is a somewhat forced positive one, but not nearly as much a
sell out as is usually the case with a made-by-committee major
commercial film. I give the whole enterprise 8.5 out of 10 stars.
<|_=00=_|>

Uneven, but still strangely likable production has lawyer Ben Affleck and
alcoholic insurance man Samuel L. Jackson having a minor accident on the
freeway. Both are late for important appointments and Affleck makes the dire
mistake of leaving Jackson stranded and accidentally leaving a hugely
important document at the scene. Soon it is apparent that Jackson's
tardiness to a court hearing was devastating as it becomes clear that wife
Kim Staunton and their two young children are going to move west to get away
from Jackson for good. Affleck's lost document creates a frenzied search to
find Jackson and get the papers back, but we all know it is not going to be
that easy. A wild and crazed cat and mouse game then starts as the road rage
flows over into both men's lives. Now each are in a contest to destroy the
other one before their enemy gets the chance. Fast-moving and quick-minded,
"Changing Lanes" kept me interested until a somewhat contrived ending that
really seemed to not fit in with the rest of the picture. Affleck and
Jackson are both pretty good here and the supporting cast is strong enough
to keep the momentum of the two leads moving. Not the best film ever made by
a long-shot, but still not a bad little ride. Just be sure your ride does
not hinder those around you. 4 stars out of 5.
<|_=00=_|>
I imagined this was going to be one film from the previews I'd seen,
but in reality it turned out to be another - a far more subtle
experience than I had expected. A lot of the people in the packed
theatre where I saw it apparently expected that other film too; they
seemed disappointed when they'd left - they'd probably been expecting
yer basic escalating violence, with us cheering for Jackson as the good
guy and Affleck as the bad. Not a black and white movie (no pun
intended), more of a karma sort of thing, with the two main characters
learning from each other in ways they never realized they would (or
needed to). And heavy-handedness is nowhere to be seen. Kudos for that
alone.
<|_=00=_|>
This movie was surprisingly good, but fans of car chase sequences and
the like will be extremely disappointed. The acting and directing is
expertly carried out, with special praise to Ben Affleck as Gavin
Banek. Changing Lanes actually explores more depth into the main
characters, and how their lives will change, either for better or
worse, rather than just dealing with pure and simple 'road rage'.

Samuel L. Jackson was well appointed as Doyle Gipson, and portrays his
part well. One character's next move to destroy the other makes
compelling viewing, and we can actually feel some sympathy for them, as
we see both their emotional and compassionate side.

The story flows well as we are drawn into Banek and Gipson's desire to
cause pain and hurt, not giving any thought to others who maybe
affected by what they are doing. Changing Lanes is not a violent film
as such, it simply explores the aspects of revenge in what could be a
true-to-life measure. This is what makes it an entertaining and
gripping movie that proved a winner for myself, and should do for many
other film fans.
<|_=00=_|>
I want to start off by saying I can completely understand how viewers
felt this movie was dull and lifeless. After the adrenaline-pumping
portrait of road rage that the marketing department projected for this
movie in its previews, it does fall completely short of expectations.

Yet the true Changing Lanes was much more subtle and humanistic than it
was meant to be. Street scenes are painted with a damp, dingy gray
color. The music is spare, thin, and mostly bleak. The two main
protagonists are people who are difficult to like, though Samuel
Jackson plays a more sympathetic character, victimized not just by a
smug lawyer, but by a history of alcoholism that has resulted in the
disintegration of his family and of his life.

What I appreciated the most about the series of events in this movie is
that manifested rage that this movie cashed in on turned out to be
quite believable. The characters lashed out at one another, but often
withdrew into a sort of introspective horror for what they had done.
They were motivated to do bad things, but they were not bad people.

The ending, perhaps, was a bit too pat, perhaps attempting to assuage
viewers who had just sat through 90 minutes of ugliness, but it didn't
sit that badly with me, and I enjoyed Affleck's drifting speech about
the girl on the beach in the end. This movie wasn't perfect, but it had
a consistent style, an appropriately low-key but still "edgy"
soundtrack, and an interesting exploration of two people who were
arguably closer to losers than heroes; yet they were interesting due to
their flaws.

If you've seen the preview for this movie, try to forget you ever saw
it and instead enjoy the considerably less glamorous movie that
Changing Lanes turned out to be.
<|_=00=_|>

While Changing Lanes won't probably make it to my personal top-something
favorite movies list, it was nevertheless a solid film, sufficiently
different from the Hollywood cliche majority of the genre to be
remembered.
The managed to keep my attention from waning, and the ethical questions
it
raised forced me to do a bit of thinking.

I might not be a strict enough movie "critic", since I tend to
forgive--overlook, even--a number of flaws, as long as they do not
outweigh
the good sides of a film. So yes, it does have a few rather unconvincing
bits [***POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT***] (first and foremost, I can't see why
go
and bankrupt somebody after only one attempt at, uhm, reconciliation)
[***END OF SPOILER***], but if you disregard them, suspending your
disbelief
for a while, you can really enjoy the movie. It grips you, even though
the
action doesn't rush at a breakneck speed; and thank goodness that it
doesn't, because that is why the movie stands out from the crowd. (As for
those IMDb posters who considered that boring: it wasn't. I'm really
sorry
for you guys, if you really need to be bombarded with adrenaline to enjoy
a
film.) Changing Lanes is "a personal-vendetta thriller with a
difference":
instead of a steady escalation of anger and violence, constantly
augmented
by the revengeful side of man's nature--as is usually the case in
I-hold-a-grudge-against-you-and-vice-versa movies--we see it moderated
now
and again by the other, more human side of these two guys, neither of
whom
is really wicked or degenerated. This is where what I see as the strength
of
this film lies--and what some other posters considered the source of
implausibility: the apparent inconsistency of the actions the two
protagonists take. True, they are inconsistent, but it is because there
are
two strong, contradictory forces at play. Even if the movie exaggerates
things a little, it still gets my respect for avoiding one-sidedness. We
human beings are, as a matter of fact, pretty erratic creatures, says the
movie. And given the right circumstances, we can be really nasty, too,
though we'd never suspect ourselves of that.

[***POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT***] And the ending? Sure, so things might have
ended, well, more grimly. But does it really spoil the movie that much?
I'd
say, rather, that it simply rounds up the whole idea of the film, which
is
not utterly pessimistic, and definitely isn't judgmental. Granted, in a
very
good commentary-like scene towards the end, Affleck's character laughs in
the rookie lawyer's face when the latter says that men are by nature
good;
but the film doesn't say we are incurably bad, either, and the ending
only
adds to that. By the way, I don't think it is all that nice-and-happy and
doesn't fit the rest of the picture; the "better" side of the struggling
Affleck, the one which comes out on top, is never really concealed
earlier
in the movie, while for Jackson things are still rather
open-ended--though
I've got to say that he deserved at least that much. [***END OF
SPOILER***]

The acting is really fine and convincing, the photography interesting,
the
soundtrack doesn't particularly stun, but doesn't irritate, either. My
recommendation: do see this film if you have a chance.
7/10.
<|_=00=_|>
Enjoyed the great acting of Ben Affleck,(Gavin Banek) along with an
outstanding performance by Samuel L. Jackson,(Doyle Gipson) who are
total strangers until they both have an accident on the FDR in New York
City. Gavin Banek is a financial lawyer who works for his father-in-law
who owns the firm and is being groomed for bigger and better things in
this law firm. Doyle Gipson is recovering from substance abuse and is
very happy about being able to purchase a new home and also the fact he
will be able to go before a judge and show how great his rehabilitation
is working out for him, so he can have the custody of his two children.
This accident causes problems for both of these men and the entire
story deals with how these two men are able to face some very difficult
lessons to be learned by both of them. There is no romance just a very
confused bunch of guys dealing with their problems in unbelievable ways
and causing more problems than is necessary. John Hart, "Body Heat" is
a sponsor for Doyle Gipson in his AA Group and does everything he can
to make sure Doyle does not take a drink.
