This film was released the same year as "My Left Foot"---and as so often
happens, the Better film gets ignored and the inferior wins the Oscars.
This is a genuinely quality performance by every member of the cast, and
it
deals with the same subject matter as MLF:  a child who grows up with a
mental gift, a disabled body, and all the tugged heartstrings that are
essential to the cinema.  Rachel Levin plays the Day-Lewis part even more
convincingly, and Norma Aleandro is never less than superb.

This is an excellent film, with a well-written script and fine performances,
particularly by Rachel Levin and Norma Aleandro.  The comments that are
placed at the front page for this film are incorrect factually on one point:
My Left Foot was released two years after this film, not concurrently.  For
what it's worth, I have Cerebral Palsy.  Both Levin and Day-Lewis deliver
stunning work in their respective roles, but my view is that MLF is a
slightly better film and both are magnificent and worth seeing.  Anyone
interested in either should by all means watch King Gimp as well, a
documentary on Dan Keplinger, an artist with Cerebral Palsy.  This film, and
the other two, are most highly recommended.

I loved this movie which was released in the same era as "My Left Foot". I
consider "Gaby: A True Story" an equal in quality to that movie, and I
hope
that it will some day receive the attention it deserves. The performance
by
the female lead is as haunting as the story itself.

This movie was very inspirational, sad, and moving.  It was amazing to
watch
someone so limited physically effect the lives around her and do so much
with her own life.  I, of course, had a huge lump in my throat when her
and
her true love Luis could not be together.  Really makes you reflect on
your
own life and realize how much more you could be doing with
it.

This is one stunning drama that never misses a beat.

Gaby, suffering from cerebral palsy, overcomes enormous challenges with
the
help of a Mexican maid and supportive parents.

But this summary barely does justice to this perfectly directed and acted
drama.

The score, by Maurice Jarre, is simply stunning, and the performances (all
of them) are spot-on.

I adore this movie and count it as one of my Top Ten of All
Time.

As is often pointed out: the same theme, as in "my Left Foot", a life
of handicapped person, Gabi. But I totally agree with jtur 88, this
movie is better than "My Left Foot". The actors are superb. I would
like to say, Everyone performs with conviction: Conviciton of not just
performances, but of the way they see life. In "Gabi" there is nothing
sentimental, nothing sensational, "No cheap pity for Gabi". This is the
basic line of the movie. Because of this I was moved deeply and I would
like to have this film at home, so that my daughter can watch it too. I
wish, there would be more movies like "Gabi". A proof of conscience in
the movie world. (Sorry for my restricted English ability)

I'll defer to the first commentator on how well the film deals with CP,
but one thing that impressed me was that -- with one or two minor
details that I question (college students usually don't live alone, and
certainly not in large apartments) -- this is the ONLY Hollywood film
I've ever seen that captures Mexico City, and Mexico, as a normal place
with its own quirks.

Really, though, the film is more about maid's nobility and heroism
(after all, she had to go to school as an adult)which is slightly
overlooked with an impressive Argentinian like Norma Leandro playing a
Mexican "campasina".

1st watched 10/9/1996 - (Dir-Luis Mandoki):
Good movie about handicapped individual trying to make the best of
her
situation by doing the best at what she can do rather than getting
down
about what she can't.
