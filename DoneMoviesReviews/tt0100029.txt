This is one of the few films by Van Damme that stand out in my mind
when I think of his 'career highlights'. All of his films are formulaic
actioners, but Lionheart is one of his better films. His character is
more layered here, which makes this more of a drama than most of his
others. We as the audience can feel for his character and, as a result,
root for him as he tries to evade his past and help what family he has
left. A nice little action film, with Van Damme forced to act a little
here. For his capabilities, he is convincing as Lyon. Harrison Page is
very good in the film as the ex-street fighter turned confidant, and
almost steals the show. A highlight of Van Damme's career.

*** out of **** stars.

Van Damme is at his best here, it's a good film that moves at a steady
pace
and is almost like a  Rocky/Street Fighter type film. The characters are
played well and the right actors and actresses are picked for the right
roles. Van Damme's trainer is great and the silent Van Damme is defiantly
the best. The plot also unwinds at the right times and at the right pace.
You should give this film a go.

Before we head off down critical trail, lets be charitable. This is a Van
Damme flick - more or less its own genre, certainly sufficiently signposted
for the unwary to avoid if this is not their comfort zone. Now I have to
admit to a certain bias - we have almost every film Van Damme has ever made,
and for the most part, on simply an entertainment scale, Jean Claude
delivers the goods. (Even as late as REPLICANT)

This offering - known pretty much EVERYWHERE but the US as WRONG BET (By far
the better title when you watch it) is value for money. You wanna see
classical acting? go study Laurence Olivier's HENRY V. You fancy mind
bending sci-fi...hell, Kubrick's 2001 ain't never gonna be topped. You want
to laugh yourself senseless? go watch a Renny Harlin flick...but you want to
see some serious hurting on screen...let Van Damme loose.

I am tiring of the incessant complaints that Van Damme can't act! Did he
ever say he could? How many of his detractors could do any better? Could
John Wayne?   did anyone ever want to SEE him being anything BUT John Wayne?
JCVD does a half decent job here I have to say and it strikes me as a case
of "let him who is without sin"  etc etc when it comes to assassinating his
thespian talents.

This film has plenty going for it......namely action, conviction and
courage. In the genre in which it finds itself necessarily categorised, I
believe a 7 is in order!

Lionheart is one of Jean-Claude Van Damme's best films! Van Damme was
good,
classic 80s series Sledge Hammer star Harrison Page was very good.The
Qissi
brothers were very good and loved Abdel's character Attila!He is such a
great one as I like many things about him!Brian Thompson was good as
always
Voyo Goric was here and look for Tony Halme AKA Ludvig Borga near the end
in
the big fight!The movie is never boring and boasts lots of action and
great
music by John Scott!If you like Van Damme and fighting films then check
out
Lionheart!

Well, I wasn't expecting such a dramatic movie, but this one really

made me cry, especially at the ending scene. The movie begins in

Djibouti, where a legionary camp is placed. The casting is wisely done.

Especially the guys which were following Lion in US. Deborah Rennard is

very cool. I think she deserved better in Hollywood. Harrison Page

perfectly fits in his role. And Van Damme... Maybe he should have made

more drama movies, he proved he is good at it. You should have this on, if
you are a fan of Van Damme, I think it is his best movie, even better than
Bloodsport. Well we're expecting more drama movies from Van
Damme.

Lionheart is clealry one of the best movies Van Damme made in his early
days. The film had good fight scenes and a nice plot. Harrison Page as Van
Damme's boy provides a lot of good one-liners and Van Damme kicks a lot of
ass. I give it *** out of ****.
<|_=00=_|>
In the Jean-Claude Van Damme martial arts movie "Lionheart," audiences
get to see a side of the Muscles from Brussels not seen in previous
action films like "Bloodsport" (1988) and "Kickboxer" (1989): Van Damme
acting and fighting like there's no tomorrow. I must be crazy for
giving "Lionheart" such a high rating based on "acting" from Van Damme
but if one can get past the phony Hollywood theatrics and the like, you
can see what is very easily the best of Van Damme's early work simply
because he isn't trying too hard... yet.

For the most part in "Lionheart," the flashy, impossible athleticism of
the Belgian-born martial arts sensation's earlier works has been
shunned in favor of straight-up no-holds-barred brawling, which is
essentially what this picture is about. After his drug-dealing brother
is set on fire in Los Angeles, Lyon Gaultier (Van Damme) deserts his
post in North Africa with the French Foreign Legion and high-tails it
to the United States to reconnect with his brother's wife and
five-year-old daughter, with two agents in hot pursuit with orders to
bring him back at any cost. Once here, he happens upon a bare-knuckle
brawl underneath a bridge and immediately stuns the natives when he
dispatches his first opponent with surprisingly little difficulty.

At this same match, he also meets Joshua (Harrison Page), a street-wise
hustler who becomes Lyon's self-appointed manager and gives Lyon the
nickname "Lionheart." Soon enough, Lyon's brawl becomes the talk of the
tight little circle interested in such senseless "human cock-fighting,"
and shamelessly amoral rich-woman fight promoter Cynthia (Deborah
Rennard) signs on Lyon as her champion for several no-holds-barred
street fights. The arenas themselves are as ridiculous as they could
possibly get - an underground parking lot, a racquetball court, a
half-filled swimming pool, and a tennis court - but they get the job
done in serving shameless blood-sport for the rich who are thirsty for
guys beating the living daylights out of each other. At the center of
it, of course, is determined Lyon, who puts aside his own reservations
about fighting for the rich and focuses squarely on putting money in
his family's pockets.

For all its scenes of combat and many, many missteps, "Lionheart" is
very easily the best of Van Damme's early martial arts movies simply
because it'll give fans of the genre what they want: maximum Van Damage
and, boy, does he damage some of his sparring partners and take some
damage of his own. The fight choreography (by Frank Dux, the real-life
character Van Damme played in his earlier "Bloodsport") is brutal and
realistic, with little flash & glitter. It's intense stuff that really
captures the beauty and brutality of no-hards-barred combat.

The script, which mostly consists of four-letter words, is obviously
the weakest point here. But how can you possibly expect a script
authored by Van Damme himself and director Sheldon Lettich to be
Academy Award-winning material? What people want to see here is
fighting, although there are some heartfelt scenes between family that
could probably warm the hearts of those who care to see such drama.

More gladiator combat spectacle than dramatic actioner, "Lionheart"
takes us to the Lion's Den and never looks back.

8/10

One thing about this movie is the plot. Basically Lionheart is fighting
to raise money for his dead brothers wife and kid. There's not much to
the plot but its rare.

The fight scenes are OK. The best is the fight at the end.(man did
Lionheart go off) What establishes Lionheart is his character: he's a
rough survivor but he's caring.

In this film there's are no shootouts, sex scenes or explosions. Thats
what separates it from most Van Damme movies. But there is a graphic
scene of a man being set on fire SO BE WARNED.

The end is sad in happy kind of way. 

This is definitely a must see.

This is easily Van Damme's best Movie.So much better then the double
pump triple twirl kick Movie's like Kickboxer and Bloodsport,though
this Movie does contain some of those moves as well.It's a wonder why
Van Damme didn't do more of these types of Movies.From start to finish
this Movie had the family feel,and I thought Van Damme acted very
well,and in my opinion had an excellent supporting cast,mainly Harrison
Page,it could be argued that he was the real star of the film and again
I must wonder why his career didn't take of after this.A very
underrated actor who has somehow flown under the radar of
Hollywood.Even if your not a Van Damme fan rent this movie,you will be
pleasantly surprised.
<|_=00=_|>

Lionheart is yet another Van Damme-movie with a lame story and great
fight-scenes.  Van Damme escapes from the French foreign-legion to find
the
people who killed his brother.  When he comes to America he starts
fighting
for money, which he gives to his family.  As said before, the story isn`t
that good, but it is head and shoulders above the terrible "Black
Eagle".
Lionheart is a great B-movie that is worth renting.
8/10
