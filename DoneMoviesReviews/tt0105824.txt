One thing is for certain - you will either hate this film, especially if you
can't stand the sea, boats and wind, or, if you like any of these,
especially if you like _all_ of them, you will love it. Admittedly it has a
simple, proven plot, gives short shrift to the history of the America's Cup
and features a rather non-describt cast - but the film does have superior
and imaginative cinematography, impeccable editing and a marvelous
soundtrack, as well as a slow, but steady build-up of drama.
To my knowledge there is no other film that even comes as close as this
movie to capture the feeling, tension and athmosphere of offshore
competitive racing. It deals with an unconventional, off-beat setting and
theme - go, see/rent/buy it if you can stand that.............

Wind is a great look at the sport of competitive sailing and also contains a
bit of insight into mechanical engineering and the process of design and
development. 

Matthew Modine is Will Parker, a good sailor who is slightly overconfident
about his skills. He joins the crew for the America Cup, but his actions
help to lose the nation's undefeated title to their tough Australian rivals.
This was more than just a loss of the cup to the new world champions, but it
also ended his relationship with girlfriend Kate Bass (Jennifer Grey) and
sent the boat captain into a bout of depression. 

But, Will Parker, with the next Cup race rolling around, Will Parker wants
to reunite a team, and seeks the help of Kate and her new beau Joe (Stellan
Skarsg√•rd) to help him rebuild his confidence, his team, and a better boat.
Will and his team challenge the Aussie's to defend their title for a second
year. 

Indeed, as another viewer wrote, the movie is rather long. But, the subject
of the movie is really something different, and the photography is just
beautiful as you get the first-person perspective of competitive sailing,
and it really gives an appreciation of what all goes into the sport, even
the traditions. Modine's character is a little annoying because he sometimes
obnoxiously boasts his masculinity to Kate as though trying to show up her
new boyfriend, Joe. It's worth catching if you can find it
around.

As a long-time sailor and racer, I admit that most consider a sailboat
race like watching the grass grow, but they've done a great job of
producing exciting racing scenes, while having so few technical
inaccuracies that the most avid of us keep rewinding to review and
debate. Take good note of the early dinghy racing scenes. I don't
believe they used any trick photography: things really can happen that
fast.

Of course, there's a larger set of stories, the classic love stories:
between men and women, of sailing, of ideas, of ideals; the rough
retelling of the Dennis Connor story (though I place Robertson/Weld as
Connor, not Modine/Parker); an accurate representation of the "Old
Boys'" network that *is* big-money yacht racing --I've met "Abigail
Weld" many times; and the "absurdity" of a desert-based effort winning
the Cup, a nod to the Melges' campaign.

The photography is astounding, the character development (the reason
for the film's length) good, and the music complimented everything
admirably.

That it's "about" sailing will turn many off, but those of us with a
love of the sea and sailing hold this as a classic to be cherished.

It's a great movie for those who like and enjoy sailing. The nautical
 vocabulary is used but there's nothing too complicated about it. It's
 filled with beautiful images of sailing boats and of the America's
 Cup.
Check on it and I doubt you'll regret.

When I first saw this film a few years ago I was totally amazed, what
happened to it upon release? Granted, here in the UK I do not know if
it ever got a cinema run, but until it appeared on one of the satellite
channels I'd never even heard of it. What a waste!

The film does a excellent job of dramatizing a sport that on first
appearances to the layman will probably appear boring. A fine balance
has to be drawn between exposition and drama, and I believe Wind
achieves this admirably. This supported by the many friends who have
seen this film upon my recommendation, most with no interest in sailing
at all.

The two leads are fine, the Aussie skipper is good fun as a typical
Aussie! The only bad call is the Abigall Weld character - rapidly
becomes annoying and unrealistic.

Where the film scores even better is the superb camera work during the
racing sequences, in particular the aerial shots - quite breathtaking.
No review would be complete without mentioning the films score - quite
simply some of the most uplifting and beautiful music I have ever
heard.

Wonderful film, highly recommended.

This is one of the movies I never tire of seeing again.  Beautiful sailing
scenes, but you don't have to know anything about sailing to appreciate it.
The cast did an earnest and excellent job.  It must have been a labor of
love to make.  Don't miss it.

When's it coming on DVD?  I want widescreen and surround sound to really
enjoy this movie at its best.  You don't have to be a sailing enthusiast
to
get caught up in the passion of sailing and The America's Cup.  Every
time I
watch this film I am reminded of the splendor of time spent on the
water.
<|_=00=_|>

This is a great movie for people into sailing. Has some
really
spectacular shots. Has the best racing shots I have ever
seen.
The best thing about the whole movie is the score by BASIL POLEDOURIS.  He
has done it again another masterpiece.

The film student in me appreciates this movie, the sailor in me loves
it. A classic among the sailing community, it is beautifully shot, and
tells a convincing fable about the costs of blind ambition and the
value of redemption. The main

character, Will Parker, is loosely based on Dennis Connor and his
performance at the 1983 and 1987 America's Cups. One of the few movies
about sailboat

racing, does turn heavy-handed at some points, but overall is an
appreciable, tightly made film with high production values. I would
recommend it.

Cinematographay, superb editing, and a first class sound track make
this film. The light in Australia and Newport, aerial shots, even
computer graphics (in news scenes), long framing shots, camera
movement, medium and close shots on board the boats, and excellent
narrative editing thrill the eye and our love of story.

Contrast between the ocean and the desert where designer and builders
construct the American challenger boat bring a delightful balance to
the iconography.

Preppie clothing and elegant on land settings let us pretend ourselves
into a special and exclusive world. With all this, the actors play
their hand in the melodrama with just the right pitch. I enjoyed the
movie. Well worth watching again.
