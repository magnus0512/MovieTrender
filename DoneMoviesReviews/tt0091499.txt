For those of us who like Maximum Overdrive, we are apparently in the
minority. I view it as a funny and entertaining, B-grade action/sci-fi
flick. There's mass destruction and tons of carnage as everything
on-screen is blown to bits...plus it's got Emilio Estevez. What's
better than that? The movie does require major suspension of disbelief
as some of the story elements don't work (for example: the
honeymooner's car works just fine, but every other machine on earth,
from lawn-mowers, electric knives, trucks, and even steam-rollers, go
haywire). But then again, this movie is all about fun. The best part of
the movie (besides Emilio) is that no one is shown any sympathy...not
even kids; in one stand-out scene, a steam-roller comes out of nowhere
and completely squashes this innocent kid. Maximum Overdrive is a cool
and outrageous cult classic that Stephen King should be proud of.
Sadly, I feel that King will never direct again.

Note for genre buffs: C.H.U.D. alumni Frankie Faison and J.C. Quinn
star in the movie. King himself also cameos as the ATM guy.

Yes its stupid, yes its dumb, yes its whatever negative word you might
wanna
say, but if you want silly action, this is for you.  After a comet passes
over earth it leaves some of its demonic haze surrounding the planet.
This
particular haze takes control of machines, making them deadly killers (for
whatever reason).  A group of people trying to stay alive hold up at the
Dixie Boy truck stop.  Some dumb enough to stray from the inside get
knocked
off, others devise a plan to escape someplace where they can wait out the
possession of the comet.  Its not the most complex of plots of course, but
if you like watching stuff get blown up or people hit by cars or trucks,
or
watching little leaguers getting neatly pressed by steamrollers, this
delivers. (Yes, really, a steamroller).

Oh, how I wished I hated this movie.  However, I don't...I actually enjoy
this movie a lot.  All the critics hate it, most people I talk to hate it,
but I like it.  Maybe it is the cool AC/DC soundtrack...I don't know.  The
action is pretty good and there are some pretty good kills in this one,
though it isn't anything that is very scary at all.  A couple of the scenes
are annoying, but for the most part I enjoy this take on the King short
story "Trucks".  This one has the machines of the world suddenly turning on
humans, though in the end it is mainly trucks that are featured.  Survivors
at a gas station are stranded there as the trucks circle the facility.  They
have to find a way out or else.  This isn't a movie that is worthy of awards
or something, but I think it is a fun movie to watch.

Get sick of movies with intricate plots, outstanding acting, and multiple
Academy Award nominations?  Then go grab Maximum Overdrive!  90 minutes of
mindless truck attacks, rocket launchers and A STEAM ROLLER RUNNING OVER A
LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYER!!!  Now, most readers are probably thinking
that this is a pretty sick review, but keep in mind that this is A MOVIE. 
Not real life.
Even with all of this in mind, I think it is fair to say that Stephen King
did a fair job with the directing.  It's by no means fantastic, but it is
far better done than most Cult Classic, B-flicks.  Happy
watching!

Hey, can't Big Steve have a little fun, too? I don't think this was a
"so bad it's funny" movie - it's too well done to have been constructed
as anything but a real comedy. Viewing this in the context of a
traditional horror/slasher movie doesn't do it justice, and with
deference to previous reviewers, trying to analyze the technical
feasibility of the antics of the machines is a lot like making a big
deal about pointing out the historical inaccuracies in Monty Python and
the Holy Grail - why? It's a MOVIE, folks, and the liberties Our Most
Televised Red Sox Fan takes with the things machines can do make it a
damned funny one at that. The scenes, characters, and quotes are a
notch below the aforementioned Grail, Spinal Tap, or Clerks, but still
classic. (I've been caught by more than one co-worker standing at my
desk screaming "WE MADE YOU!" at my laptop, but hey, to each his own.)
Five out of five stars, as long as you come in with the right
perspective!

I really cannot understand why this movie has such a bad overall
rating. According to me a movie doesn't have to have a great plot or so
to be appealing. First of all I like the movie for the soundtrack by
AC/DC. Actually, I learned to know the music of them by watching this
movie. The 'Who made Who' theme song conducts the beginning of the
movie excellent when a traffic bridge is starting to open beyond human
control. The same goes for the other songs in the movie - they really
add. Secondly I like the movie for the humor in it. It's not a comedy
but some scenes made me laugh - like the bible sales man who gets mad
when his car is hit by a truck and he runs outside the roadhouse -
cursing like hell; the truck hits him into a sewer and his shoes stay
behind. Or the beginning of the movie in which you see a guy
withdrawing money from an ATM and on the screen the message appears
'you're an *sshole'. 'Sugar buns, this thing is calling me an *sshole
!' If you watch closely you might also notice just before this scene a
digital clock on the building on which the time changes into F*CK YOU.
Maybe I'm just simple but I like the movie. Better than some not
understandable romantic drama if you'd ask me.

A classic, I know the acting wasn't all that great, you had to love the
AC/DC soundtrack. When you mention Maxiumum Overdrive you think of AC/DC,
trucks and machines killing and injuring anyone in their way. I liked this
movie and really had nothing bad to say about it, I thought it was a good
idea for a horror film and maybe not executed out like it could have been,
but still very good and entertaining.

I grew up with this movie and always have found it quite entertaining.
NO, it's not an Oscar contender, but it's funny as hell. The earth gets
caught in the tail of some crazy comet and machines start going wack.
You have everything from trucks going AWOL and attacking innocent
people to an ARMY machine gunner thing that starts tearing people to
pieces. It's AWESOME!!! The scene with vending machines alone is worth
the price of admission. These crazy vending machines start attacking
these kids by shooting out cans at mach speed. It's hilarious. I also
loved the soundtrack. I mean AC/DC...Are you kidding me? The whole
movie is like an AC/DC concert and as those of us who have been to an
AC/DC concert can verify, this is certainly a treat.

When an invisible force of Aliens takes over the world in over a week.
The force uses the machines to attack on the whole population of the
world. The force uses all kinds of things, especially-Trucks. When
Citizens and Co-Workers of the Dixie Boy Truck Stop, the people ended
up fighting for their lives.

Written & Directed by Stephen King (Screen-writer of Cat's Eye, Silver
Bullet, Sleepwalkers) made a dumb but entertaining film. The film's
stars:Emilio Estevez, Pat Hingle, Laura Harrington and Yeardley Smith
(Who voiced Lisa Simpson in the animated hit show "The Simpsons"). This
was a box office flop on it's release. This is still today, extremely
underrated but it's not the worst-Stephen King film yet.

DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an
digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The Laserdisc
Edition has an commentary track by King. Too bad, the Anchor Bay DVD
doesn't have his commentary. DVD extras are Stephen King Bio and an
excellent funny trailer. 

The Canadian DVD from Vivendi ("Universal") has an good anamorphic
Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround
Sound. The campy trailer is included as well. It's worth seeing for
Stephen King fans and Curious Viewers. King had to cut 11 seconds to
not get an X-Rating. Great rock score by AC/DC. Joe Dunton Camera
Widescreen. (J-D-C Scope). (****/*****).

When Earth passes through the tail of Rea-M rogue comet, the machines
come to life and threaten and kill the mankind. A group of survivors is
under siege of fierce trucks in the Dixie Boy truck stop in a gas
station and they have to fight to survive.

"Maximum Overdrive" is a silly, campy, funny and highly entertaining
movie by Stephen King with a great soundtrack by AC/DC. Despite the
awful story, acting and direction, I saw this cult movie again
yesterday afternoon and it makes laugh so stupid it is. Fortunately
Stephen King has given up directing movies. My vote is six.

Title (Brazil): "Comboio do Terror" ("Convoy of Terror")
