ROMEO IS BLEEDING is a fascinating and unusual hybrid of highly
personalized old fashioned 40s noir and ultra-violent stylized 90s
crime drama. It's the kind of movie they never make anymore, with an
unappealing protagonist, an entirely corrupt universe where justice and
virtue won't triumph and a heartbreaking ending which basically
guaranteed it would never be a commercial hit. Obviously some were put
off by these things, accounting for the low rating this minor
masterpiece sleeper has. Bur that's part of why I love it!

While there is significant "man's man" violence and the obvious
titillation from Lena Olin, this movie is at its heart a pure noir
cautionary tale carefully structured to get us to the amazingly
powerful payoff, which tops all. The writer (Hilary Henkin) is
obviously knowledgeable about her 40s and 50s hard boiled repertoire
and fills ROMEO with references and touches which students of the genre
will enjoy.

But the center of this movie is Gary Oldman. His blisteringly desperate
performance as a corrupt cop at the end of the long slide to oblivion
defines the movie and is both hypnotic and disturbing. His voiceovers
are a worthy throwback to the old Raymond Chandler raps voiced by
Bogart or Dick Powell or Robert Montgomery. This isn't a nice or
likable character but Oldman is believably relatable as he inexorably
tries to "feed the hole" with his greed and inevitably circles the
existential drain.

Lena Olin is at her menacing best; this is surely the role which landed
her the gig as Sidney's subtly venomous mother in ALIAS, and she takes
full advantage of the over-the-top femme fatale characterization with
deadly verve. Oldman and Olin share a bizarre chemistry which is
fortunate for the script, because Olin's repeated seductions of Oldman
(where he basically knows she is luring him to his doom) would never
have worked if the actors didn't bring it to life on the screen. There
aren't a lot of actresses who can out-menace Gary Oldman but Lena Olin
absolutely pulls it off.

ROMEO IS BLEEDING is not perfect. Roy Scheider's mafioso character is
strangely caricatured and sticks out in a world otherwise occupied by
three dimensional players. Scheider tries hard, too, which is a shame
because it's just not there in the role. Lena Olin's brazen escape from
police custody defies plausibility in the extreme. Gary Oldman is
seemingly not quite properly motivated at all times. Nevertheless, the
searing denouement to this movie burns all of these concerns away
because it is one of the most unexpectedly poignant and heartrending in
the last quarter century of noir. If you have a pulse, you will well up
at the end, and probably think about a longing that you left behind at
some point in your life against your wishes. 9 / 10

Probably everyone has one favorite movie that they consider "their own"
because few, if any, of their friends share their admiration for it.
Mine is this one. I just love this film.

It is only one out of over 5,000 movies have either rented or purchased
that I watched back-to-back nights after seeing it for the first time.
A dozen viewings later, It's still just as good, if not better. It is,
start-to-finish, the most entertaining crime movie I have ever watched.

Being of fan of film noir, those wonderfully-narrated crime films of
the '40s and '50s, Romeo Is Bleeding is right up my alley. I may be
wrong but believe this whole film is simply a parody of the film noirs:
an outrageous take on those movies with an over-the-top villain (Lena
Olin, the most fascinating female I have ever come across on film),
along with over-the-top characters, action scenes, dialog and
narration. It's a wild, fun - albeit sick - ride, not to be taken
seriously (which a lot of people did and then thought it was too
goofy). Evidence of this film-noir spoof is in the dialog, with a
number of fantastic dark-humor lines, many delivered by Olin. One has
to see this a number of times to catch all the humor in here. Kudos to
screenplay writer Hilary Henkin for her work.

Oldman is superb and its the glue that holds this unique story in tact.
His narration, including the exaggerated inflection in his voice, is
fantastic. I appreciate the American accent this British actor used,
too. Olin, as Russian hit- woman Mona Demarkoff, she is one character I
guarantee you will not ever forget. Roy Scheider, Annabella Sciorra,
Juliette Lewis, Michael Wincott and others - cameos by Dennis Farina
and Ron Perlman - all deliver great performances with lines that,
well,....as I said, are outrageous. 

If you love the old film noirs, please check this movie out and
remember it's tongue-and-cheek.

I happened to stumble on this one night. What a mesmerizing movie! Gary
Oldman is terrific as a corrupt Detective. You get the feeling from this guy
that he was probably once a young, idealistic, honest cop, who has just been
slowly manipulated, and seduced by the seaminess, the money, the sex, the
despair.

How this guy could stray from Annabella Sciorra is beyond me, but that's
another story.

What you see is this guy's whole life crumble down around him, due to his
poor choices, his dishonesty, and his inability to control his cravings.
Just about everything that could go wrong does, and his entire life,
everything he thought he was working for, virtually blows up in his
face.

To finally see, and realize all he's lost is played out very well by Oldman.
A very well-done, well-acted film.

The ultimate Gary Oldman Film Noir!  If you want to see a great thriller
that makes you sit on the edge of your seat with out being overly gory,
check this movie out!

Big city cop in "It", up to here!  Great story and cinematography!
Excellent soundtrack, and the weirdest cop story I've ever seen.  I have
seen it, I don't know how many times, but I never tire of
it.

Everyone does a fine job of acting and Lena Olin is one of the most lethal
women in a movie I've ever seen.  She should been cast as a killer in a
"Bond" film by now.

Oldman is great with his New York accent, and makes you feel the pain he
feels when he loses a toe, or should I say, when it's taken from him.  I
won't say how, but he's got some bad friends in low places.

It's a love story that gets all f***ed up.  But what an incredible ride
through the film.  He's up and when he comes down, it's crash and burn all
over the place.

Rent it, buy it, just see it.  The DVD is here finally, wish there was a
commentary on it, but that's how it goes.  Ciao 4 now xoxox

One of my favorite lines from "Romeo Is Bleeding," an overlooked
tribute to film noir. Jack Grimaldi(Oldman)is a crooked cop that rats
info to the mob about the whereabouts of mob witnesses. He is also a
louse of a husband, cheating on his wife(Sciorra)with a waitress
(Lewis). Life, in his view, is good, especially when he gets the money
from the mob, which he uses "To feed the hole" in his backyard. Then,
one day, his life slowly goes on a descent to hell when he is assigned
to watch over the deliciously wicked Mona(Lena Olin, who should have
gotten an Oscar nod for this performance). Mona makes a proposition to
Jack: Help her fake her death and he will be paid VERY well. The
problem is that the mob, led by Roy Scheider, wants Jack to wipe her
out, or they will wipe him out. What happens to the characters in this
film is what makes this a very intense film. The scenes between Olin
and Oldman are hot enough to burn a hole in your television screen.
This is a must see film that you have to have in your collection.

If you're looking for realism and seriousness don't watch it. Always
complaining and whining about over-acting don't watch this. Go see Abel
Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant instead if you can handle the realism in that
movie at least, has a bit of over-acting too though.

Gary Oldman, Lena Olin and Roy Scheider are absolutely brilliant and
super-cool in this movie.

Beautiful entertaining piece of artwork. Extremely violent and very
sexy.

I've read a few negative reviews about this movie. I suppose those
people can't relate to this. Maybe they never crossed a line that
shouldn't be crossed and never as a result of this experienced the
inescapable downward spiral leading straight to oblivion. Lucky them.

Romeo is Bleeding is a tale of a fallen man.  And, portraying
this fallen man, is possibly the world's finest actor -

Gary Oldman.

He lives the story of a bad cop, turned worse, with no
chance for redemption.

Nobody does it better.
Lena Olin is wonderful, too, as the psychotic hit-woman
who
leads Oldman's Jack Grimaldi down the trail to Hell.

The combination of a faboulous story-line, and acting like
this,
should've garnered much more attention than it did.

A wonderful film with spectacular acting.

Gut-wrenching thriller about corrupt cop Jack Grimaldi who tries to become a
very rich man by working at the same time for the New York Police Department
and for the Mob as an informant. Things start to go downhill when he falls
in love with a cruel and merciless assassin, Mona Demarkov, who's being
targeted by the Mob. Romeo is Bleeding is the ultimate film-noir of the 20th
century, everything about this film is so weird and evokes a sense of
despair and hopeless that watching it Â‘till the last minute puts you gasping
for more air. It's hard to put it into words, since Romeo is Bleeding is
more like an experience itself, but a simplistic way to define the
atmosphere the picture creates is describing it as a cross between the
violence and style of a Batman movie (only without Batman) and your typical
Humphrey Bogart flick, like The Maltese Falcon. Outstanding performances by
Gary Oldman as Grimaldi and Lena Olin as Mona Demarkov. This character was a
true present for Olin and she chews the scenery every moment she's on
screen. The part was perfect for her, no one could pull this one of so
perfectly, except perhaps for Jennifer Connelly, it would be interesting to
see her in a role like that, since it seems that Jennifer herself jumped
right of a 30's-40's noir movie (I was impressed by her in Dark City). Burt
Reynolds or Tom Selleck would have suited perfectly into the role of
Grimaldi, but Oldman was great. I also found very interesting that Jack
Grimaldi wasn't a bad guy, Oldman constructed the character as a man who
just wouldn't fit in the life that was given for him, and his thirst for
more and more was responsible for sending his life into a spiral of 
violence, decadence and death.

I had to comment because I simply can not believe all of the lower
rating numbers this film has received; it's one of my very favorite
films of the 1990s.

This film is not perfect, as stated by other people, Roy Schieder is
terribly miscast (although I was more distracted by his obvious
face-lift).

Otherwise, this film rocks. The rest of the cast is simply superb and I
don't know how in the world Gary Oldman, Juliette Lewis, Annabella
Sciorra and Lena Olin were not nominated for the Academy Award in their
respective categories. Hilary Henkin has written a tight and compelling
script and it's directed with sheer brilliance.

Gary Oldmaan is one of the best actors of his generation and nowhere is
that comment more obvious than in his performance in this film. As Jack
Grimaldi, his New York accent is spot-on. He creates a character which
most people will recognize somewhere in his/her life and delivers it
with such ease that you live Jack's life through this outstanding
actor's performance. Juliette Lewis has never been better. Her
performance is funny, touching and ultimately tragic. Annabella Sciorra
is glorious as Jack's earth-mother wife. Everything about her
performance rings true. But, it's impossible to even find words to
describe Lena Olin's Mona Demarkoff. Wow! Beautiful, sexy, tough,
cold-hearted, vicious and unrelenting. I'm impossible to ever forget
her performance once you've seen it. I haven't seen this film in years,
and I'm still upset that she didn't win the Academy Award and wasn't
even nominated! When this film failed to get any nominations at all was
the time I stopped watching the Oscars.

Rent it. You'll never forget it.

Romeo Is Bleeding is an excellent film. It is Number 2 on my all time
favourite list. Number 1 is "Midnight Run". Why doI like it? It has a
great performance by Gary Oldman, (from Sid and Nancy and Track 29). I
became a big fan of Oldman and watched everything I could get my hands
on by this guy! The direction is first rate by British master Peter
Medak (Let Him Have It and Ponatiac Moon) and a very moody jazz score
by the talented Mark Isham! I also own the soundtrack. Dariusz Wolski
did amazing cinematography on this one. He would later go on to do Dark
City and The Mexican. So yeah, a good crew and a great cast, what can I
say? Other kudos must go out to the beautiful women in this, Lena Olen
and Juliette Lewis are breathtaking in this. And the sex scenes are
pretty steamy.....for me anyway. Some light B&D in this. Scrited by
Hillary Henken (Roadhouse and Wag the Dog) and a nice character by
Michael Wincott.....he says "HEY YOU GOTTA GIVE ME SOMETHING,....(to a
stranger) WHAT THE @&^#! ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT?!" Best line hands down: Do
you know what is so scary about love? It's that you don't own it. IT
OWNS YOU!! That line has a lot of truth, for me. So rent it if you
wanna see something dark, edgy, and independent! Thank ya!
