Next Friday is actually pretty funny even though it lacks the film's first
scene stealer Chris Tucker. Ice Cube makes a funny script with the help of
new scene stealer Mike Epps who plays his cousin Day-Day. All in all if you
just want a good time check this one out.

Rated R for Language,Drug Use and Sexual Content.

Next Friday is the sequel to the movie Friday and the second movie in
the trilogy.Friday and Friday After Next were very funny movies.This
one was not as funny but did have some really funny moments and was
overall a fun and entertaining film.In this one, Craig moves to the
suburbs with his rich uncle Elroy and his cousin Day Day.The reason he
moves out of his old neighborhood is because Deebo has broken out of
jail and wants revenge on Craig for beating him up(this happened in the
first movie).There are some more funny characters in this movie such as
Pinky the owner of the record store that Day Day works at and the three
Mexican brothers who like to start trouble.Next Friday may not be as
good as the first or third Friday movie but it is still funny and worth
watching.

8/10

Next Friday is a movie i enjoyed to see all 4 times. That movie made me
laugh so many times. The rating should be a 10 because i thought it was
excellent. Ice Cube and Jacob Vargas were my favorite actors in that movie.
And that African who came in the Pinky's store made me really crack up. OK,
this is all for the comments,keep up the good work of making these kind of
movies, and if possible, can the people please make a third
part
Thank you very much

I saw this movie tonight at the theater.  I was delighted at the humor
involved in this movie, but was also upset that certain elements of the
first movie were used in this. It was also disappointing that Chris Tucker
was not a part of the cast. Overall, I believe the movie was hilarious, and
if you are a fan of the first movie you should definitely see this
one.

That's my favorite of many funny lines from the Joker Bros. in NEXT FRIDAY.
Jacob Vargas was hilarious, and he's been in a lot of other good movies
like
AIRBORNE, CRIMSON TIDE, MY FAMILY, GET SHORTY, SELENA, and ROMY AND
MICHELLE. Justin Pierce was also another funny character, one most kids
like
me could identify with (white boy from the 'burbs who loves skateboarding
but can't skate for crap). It's sad that he's no longer with us. Ice Cube
is
a talented guy, and he did the best (or worst) he could with his character,
but it wasn't a shining role like it was in FRIDAY. The family (Uncle
Elroy,
Day-Day, Suga, Mr. Jones) got a little annoying at times. The "biches"
(Joker's women) were very hot, and Lisa Rodriguez had a smart female
character, something not seen much in movies like these. Also, the return
of
Tom "Tiny" Lister Jr.'s character was unnecessary. It was built up nicely,
but the delivery sucked.

"Whites in hot, colors in cold, ese!"

You have to give Ice Cube credit. He tried to make a good sequel, but
somehow it didn't quite work. It was close though, and fairly
funny.

At one point, in narration, Craig says, "I sure miss Smokey."

We do too.
<|_=00=_|>

First off: Why is Craig smoking? Why is Craig pimping? Why is Craig
beating
up Pinky? Where are the good Female Characters? Where is Smokey? Where is
F.
Gary Gray? Why is Craig's dad poop gag (good in the first one) so played
out? Why is Baby D a rip-off of Felicia? Why is day-day's gf a rip-off of
Craig's gf in Friday? Why is the soundtrack not as good as the first one?
Why, in spite of all this, it's still funny!!!! If you haven't seen/don't
like Friday, check it out. It's cliched (fat girl, crazy white guys, crazy
mexican guys) but it's pretty good. 7/10

It is not easy to sit through the whole movie and expect a plot or anything
to say for that matter.  However, there are some seriously funny things
that
you can't help but laugh at.  Depending on what vain you see the movie in
and what you're looking for, your response will vary.  But if you just take
it as that there are some things that will make you hysterically laugh then
by all means, see this movie.

Debo escapes from county jail chained to Tyrone. Debo is looking for
revenge against Craig Jones (Ice Cube). Craig's dad sends him to stay
with his cousin Day-Day (Mike Epps) in Rancho Cucamonga. His unemployed
uncle Elroy won the lottery allowing him to buy a house in the suburbs.
Craig gets into some misadventures with his cousin's family and the
Latino gangster neighbors as the family faces foreclosure.

I'm not saying that Chris Tucker is a magical elixir for any franchise
but part of the original charm is the lead characters' friendship.
Essentially, this sequel switches out Tucker for Epps. If that's how
easy it is to drop a lead character, how much should the audience care
about any of the characters. It's a mess of crude broad humor that
doesn't hit enough times. Ice Cube has good charisma as lead but there
isn't much more than that.

Next Friday (2000): Dir: Steve Carr / Cast: Ice Cube, Mike Epps, John
Witherspoon, Tommy "Tiny" Lister, Tamala Jones: Brainless mess with
absolutely no reason for existing. Sequel to Friday with Ice Cube
writing and narrating the film. He was responsible for Tommy "Tiny"
Lister landing in prison but after an escape, Cube is sent to live with
his Uncle Elroy. Cube's cousin works at Pinky's Record Store where he
hides out on his pregnant girlfriend. Next door live drug dealers with
a nasty pit bull. There is a subplot involving taxes and saving the
property etc. Witless and predictable with uninspiring directing by
Steve Carr. Ice Cube plays the humourless lead, which works against the
mood of the film. It is as if Cube arrived on the wrong set. Mike Epps
plays Cube's best friend who is a complete idiot. John Witherspoon
plays Cube's less than friendly father. Perhaps the worst element is an
embarrassing appearance by Lister who breaks out of prison and seeks
revenge on Cube. Perhaps he should seek out the producers of this film.
Tamala Jones plays Epps's pregnant ex-girlfriend although being part of
this film gives her something else to be angry about. The conclusion
presents theft and drugs as fun as oppose to the endless trouble
brought to those who dabbled in it. Nothing of value in this film that
prides itself on being stupid. This film should be tossed in a campfire
for a marshmallow roast. Score: 1 / 10
