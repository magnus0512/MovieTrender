I love stupid movies... I live for them, in fact, and this was definitely
stupid.  Spend the $5, go see it for yourself!  If you weren't interested
in
it, you probably wouldn't be looking at reviews in the first place unless
you're a concerned parent (let your kids see it, it's not too bad), or if
you hated it and wanted to see if anyone actually enjoyed it.  I did, and
I
recommend it to anyone who just wants to laugh at the antics of two total
stoners.  Personally, I think a different ending could have made this
movie
a lot more enjoyable, but I don't want to give it away, so see it for
yourself.  This one won't win any awards (with a name like "Dude, Where's
My
Car?" one wouldn't expect it to be a contender, anyway), but for all of us
who have had a "night to remember" that we forgot, it's damn
funny.

"Dude" is by no means an intelligent movie, nor does it want to be one.
However, it is treated as one by the public. If you don't like stupid
movies, why did you go see it anyway!? I mean, personally, I love stupid
movies. American Pie, Idle Hands, Evolution- all genius. But if you see any
of them thinking you are going to get an intelligent comedy the problem
lies
within you and your lack of a sense of humor.

Or maybe you're just too old.

This movie is funny, period. Everyone I know (and like) that saw it
thought it was hilarious, including me. I don't understand what people
were expecting when they saw this! It was a thousand times funnier than
any recent Ben Stiller "comedy". There are at least a dozen scenes that
made me laugh out loud. The couple of people that actually wrote a good
review for this said that it was so stupid that it was funny. Well, I
don't think it was any stupider than most of the unfunny "comedies"
that have come out lately...And a lot of people compared the to "Bill
and Ted". Why? It was nothing like "Bill and Ted", except for maybe
there were 2 male leads, like countless other buddy comedies. You
people are just... WRONG!

Dude Where's My Car is one of those movies that is so stupid, that it
is
hilarious.  I could not stop laughing throughout this movie. 
My
favourite scene is the Chinese food place one.  I've never laughed
so
hard at a movie.  I totally recommend this movie to people who
like
stupid comedy.

And theeeen.....

Of all the stupid (yet funny) movies out there, "Dude, Where's My Car?"
is definitely one of the funniest.

Nowadays, so many stupid/funny stoner movies are out, but none can
really compare to the hilariousness that Chester and Jesse bring out of
each other. Reminiscent to Beavis and Butthead, they cruise around as
two aimless stoners with no real purpose in life but to shibby, shibby,
and shibby. (Shibby, which could stand for ANYthing, really.) Being the
first to fully implement the words "Dude" and "Sweet", Jesse and
Chester deserve two thumbs-up for this stoner movie. Teenagers of any
generation would definitely enjoy it. I've seen it a hundred times and
still love it to this day.

Shibby!!!

I have to admit it,the plot (2 guys not remembering what they did the
night before and ending up in an intergalactic crisis)is every bit as
ridiculous as it sounds,but the truth is, for some twisted reason , I
like this movie. If people don't like this kind of stuff,why did they
choose to watch it in the first place?

Whatever this movie lacks in intelligence is compensated by the talent
of its two stars:Seann William Scott is as entertaining as in American
Pie and Road Trip,and as for Ashton Kutcher...Well,That 70's Show
aside,he's never really managed to be this funny again. Those two guys
know they're not doing a masterpiece such as Some Like It Hot, but they
manage to make us giggle with the material they've been given. They
know this movie will never appear in any Top 10 or 50 (except maybe
Stupidest Movies Ever), and they're fine with that. And so should the
audience.

So,if you want to watch something that's funny but intelligent,watch a
Woody Allen movie,or Wes Anderson's films,or The Simpsons,but if you
want to watch something that just makes you laugh without having you
focus on the story,I strongly recommend Dude,Where's My Car?.

OK, I've read a lot of the reviews, and I'm somewhat disappointed by the
negative ones. Of COURSE this isn't gonna be the best movie you ever saw!
Of
COURSE it's gonna be mindlessly stupid! What, you were actually expecting
something like a cinematic masterpiece? My friends and I went to see this
movie after taking some major tests, and we wanted to laugh and relax. By
watching DWMC we succeeded! As soon as it comes out on video, it's going
straight to my "stupidly funny movie" collection, along with Bill and
Ted's
Excellent Adventure and American Pie. Look, if you're willing to lower
your
IQ to that of the average stoner and-G*d forbid-have a good time at the
movies, go see Dude, Where's my Car? As long as you know what you're gonna
get out of it, it's not a waste of money. And hey, if you do get totally
bored, go buy a large popcorn with lots of butter and amuse yourself by
seeing how many popped kernels you can get on people's heads without them
noticing. (I warned you, you won't like the movie if you can't be stupidly
immature-think blink-182's What's My Age Again?-for a couple of
hours)

Highly entertaining the first 100 times I saw it, now not so much. The
'and then' segment at the drive thru entered my homes dialect and has
not left yet. Hot chicks are sprinkled thru the movie, as well as the
very disturbing she-male stripper. This movie is often thought of as
the epitome of bad, but really it's funny enough. Is it formulaic?
Sure. Is Ashton Kutcher a total tool? Kinda looks so. Seann William
Scott is the funnier of the two by far. Great cameo appearance of Brent
Spiner (knows as DATA on Star Trek Next Generation). The bubble wrap
jumpsuits are also highly entertaining and original. I thought there
was going to be a sequel to this, but it evidently fell thru.

A fun, light hearted movie, with moments of comic genius... I like a
classic, epic, drama as much as the next guy. But, this wasn't one of
those. This was a flick to laugh at. If you are generally a happy
person and can laugh or cry at commercials, then you will enjoy the
antics and slapstick of this movie. If you are constantly judgmental,
moody, or jealous when you see other people having a good time... then
this might not make you smile. Did I say smile? That's the idea folks.
A film that makes you smile is not going to always get an Oscar. This
film is far from Dumb & Dumber, and not close to Neil Simon. Lighten
up, loosen up, and cheer up with some popcorn and you will laugh.

I saw this under the, ah, recommendation of Dave Barry ("Everything you
need to know about America"). It's a typical forgettable, goofy,
non-sequitur filled comedy that manages to be on-target the majority of
the time. Some *extremely* corny moments (one word: ostriches), but no
gaping holes in the plot, and in the end, everything's resolved as
reasonably as can be expected.

Recommendation: Pick it up if you're a fan of dependable screwball
comedy and want to see a pretty good effort by Ashton Kucher. Not
enough manic energy to qualify as a party movie, and definitely not for
couples (unless you have a great sense of humor, of course).
