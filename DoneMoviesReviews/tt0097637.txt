James Belushi) is a "loose cannon" cop. He has to do everything his own
way on his own time and doesn't know the meaning of the word,
"team-work" But after he screws up his last bust by buying a car from a
car dealer and five minutes later proceeds to crash it into a building
where the bad guys are dealing dope, he is assigned a new partner, a
dog! To be exact. A rouge German Shepard that wants to be treated more
like a person than a dog.

Belushi is very convincing and hilarious in his role as a cop, and the
dog, surprisingly (I never thought I'd write this), was a great actor
and did a terrific job. Hat's off to his handler!

There are predictable and very typical cop vs. bad guy moments, but
overall I thought the movie was an extremely funny cop-doggy comedy,
with a very predictable but humorous ending to it.

When compared to other cop-dog movies like "Turner and Hooch," it's a
credit to Belushi's comedic timing that this film wound up on the top
250!

As a young child, K-9 was one of my favourite films, and although my
tastes
have matured with time, this is still a very funny film, with one of the
most underrated actors ever, James Belushi.  Playing the superb Bill
Murray
deadpan style, but usually as a cop, rather than Murray's humorous loser
roles, Belushi is a likeable dodgy cop.  The end scene in the hospital is
the best man and dog conversation ever, although Jerry Lee jumping in the
poodle's car runs it pretty close.

My rating : 9 out of 10

James Belushi and the dog named "Jerry Lee" make an excellent pair in this
fun cop romp. The duo make a natural pair and Belushi puts in an excellent
performance without getting behind the lovable "Jerry Lee," who gets
animated very aptly by excellent editting and direction.

 Fun movie, see it.

James Belushi is the cop, Dewley, who seems to have spent most of his time
chasing after the same guy, the drug lord Lyman played Kevin Tighe. And is
then finally forced to get a partner in the shape of Jerry Lee the German
Shepard dog. They have a very comedic relationship quite like that of Turner
and Hooch. 

Things take a dangerous turn for Dewley and Jerry Lee when Dewley's
girlfriend Tracey, played by Mel Harris, is taken hostage by Lyman. A tragic
outcome that turns out great in the end, and even Jerry Lee gets to have a
girlfriend. 

Great acting by James Belushi, Mel Harris and Jerry Lee.
A score of 7 out of 10.

I do agree the story is predictable, and the ending didn't quite excite
or move me. However, it does work surprisingly well as a man-and-dog
buddy movie. The film is at least nice to watch, the soundtrack is
decent, the direction is good and the script does have a few laughs
that makes the experience enjoyable. And the acting is very spirited-
Jerry-Lee is the star of the show, very well trained and cute, while
James Belushi is always watchable and Mel Harris is appealing and sexy.

Overall, this is a surprisingly good buddy movie with enough humorous
moments and spirited performances to make it worth watching. 8/10

This is NOT the best cop/dog movie, but it IS superior to the Chuck
Norris/pooch flick. Personally, I found Turner and Hooch to be superior
to this work, but it is still enjoyable, and comes in second to my
favorite.

HOwever, this is witty, and funny enough to be endearing, without
resorting to Jim Belushi's usual tactics, although he does employ the
beginning of those posturing and chest-beating tactics here. But they
are not so dominant that the movie suffers. In fact, they play well in
this situation, though it IS sad to watch a grown man who is
romantically jealous of a dog.

This fails any Oscar possibilities, but I do not honestly believe that
would surprise those involved with this work. The bottom line: This is
a fun movie. It fails to warm the heart as well as Turner and Hooch,
but does not make you feel sorry for the dog like some other movies
have, along this venue. It is entertaining and fun, and rates a 6.6/10
from...

For a short time during the eighties, Hollywood discovered to concept of
the
Buddy-Dog movie with this and Turner & Hooch coming out in the same year.

This is probably the funniest of the two with Belushi delivering another
wonderful comic performance. However, it is probably slightly poorer than
the Tom Hanks film as the script is less rounded, with only the fairly
run-of-the-mill drug smuggling story to occupy you.

However, the action and laughs keep coming throughout the movie, leaving
another underrated, overlooked comedy gem from Belushi. I can't wait for
the
sequel coming out this year.

K-9 is a somewhat predictable comedy about a man and his drug dog. Belushi
does a good job playing Michael Dooley, a person whose only pet previous to
owning Jerry Lee (the dog) was fish. Fairly convincing performance by Kevin
Tighe as the drug-smuggling millionaire. The acting was a bit thin at times,
but not a bad movie.

Narcotics Cop Thomas Dooley(James Belushi) is an unusual off-beat
person... who loves to work alone. One day, his boss (Cotther Smith)
wants Dooley find an new partner. He decides to use an K-9 named Jerry
Lee (Koton), who has the best nose for the drug-busting business. At
first, Dooley and Jerry Lee don't get along until they share a few
things in common. At the same time, Dooley does his best with his love
life (Mel Harris) and trying to bust a prominent socialite (Kevin
Tighe). Thomas and his new partner are in for a wild ride.

Directed by Rod Daniel (Beethoven's 2nd, Like Father Like Son, Teen
Wolf) made an enjoyable if silly cop between an relationship with a man
and a dog. Belushi and especially Koton are good in the film. There's
some hilarious moments, which this movie is aimed at kids but there's
some violent scenes as well.

DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good
Dolby Surround 2.0 Sound. DVD features are basically like the original
theatrical trailer and cast & filmmakers' bios. "K-9" was an surprise
box office hit. But the relationship between a man and a dog came out
months earlier in 1989, which it has some of the same premise titled
"Turner & Hooch". But i feel that "K-9" is the better film than the
other one. But that's up to the viewer to decide. There's some familiar
faces in "K-9" in bit parts like Ed O'Neill, Alan Blumenfeld, Pruitt
Taylor Vince, Dan Castellaneta (Best Known as the voice of Homer
Simpson on "The Simpsons") and William Salder. "K-9" was so popular on
video, there was two Direct to Video movies produced... starring James
Belushi. "K-9" is a good cop comedy with some genuine laughs. Worth
seeing. (****/*****).

The picture talks about James Belushi a quirky policeman who develops
lonely his mission with the aim to track down an important drug peddler
(Kevin Thige). The police chief (James Handy) assigns him as couple , a
hound dog (Jerry Lee was played by Rando, a 3-year-old German Shepherd
from West Germany and trained for 3 months) . They will have to
confront deal of dangers while his fiancée (Mel Harris) is abducted .

The motion picture is a particular buddy movie because the starring are
one person and one dog , the comedy and giggles regarding both of them
are interminable . Over 40 dogs were considered but none of the
American German Shepherds were deemed suitable . A year-long search was
held to find the right dog for the role . The dog chosen , Rando ,
learned to understand commands in English . There's a previous picture
concerning to similar theme upon policeman-dog relationship : ¨Turner
and Hooch¨ , both of them are similar , though I think the best results
to be the film featured by Tom Hanks.

The flick blends humor , action-packed , car pursuits , tongue-in-cheek
, it's amusing but there are moments that is a little boring but when
the dog appears is enough bemusing . The film obtained success at the
box office ; however , ten years later , the same starring James
Belushi and the dog (or different dog because had deceased) made a
second part what failed and was direct-to-video . Subsequently had a
third part that was another flop . The flick will appeal to action
comedy buffs and dog lovers. Rating : Average 5'5/10
