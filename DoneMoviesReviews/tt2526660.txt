Sitting down to watch this movie without having a single clue what it
was about was a bad idea. I should have read the synopsis first and
then saved myself the waste of time.

Had I known this to be a softcore pseudo-erotic movie, I wouldn't have
bothered with it. The movie here, I will admit, did have potential,
based on the story, because it was an interesting story of drama,
betrayal, secret lives and such. And had it been told in the way of a
proper movie without all the nudity and softcore sex scenes, the movie
would have been enjoyable and watchable - and would actually have been
a good movie.

But such was not the case. This is a movie that focuses a lot of nudity
and sex scenes, which are rather graphic for a Tagalog movie. Of
course, whether or not you enjoy this is a matter of preference, and
also whether or not you enjoy softcore pornography. Personally, I
didn't and as such found this movie to be anything but enjoyable.

The story is about Riki (played by John James Uy) who is married to
Regine (played by Max Eigenmann) and together they have a daughter.
However, Riki's attention stray and he have an affair with Sarah
(played by Yam Concepcion).

I will say that the acting in the movie was actually good enough. Of
course, don't expect award winning performances, but people did good
jobs with their given roles.

If you enjoy softcore Tagalog entertainment, then "Rigodon" might be
just the think you are looking for.
