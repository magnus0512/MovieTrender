This movie is an absolutely wonderful fantasy. I totally loved it.

The dialog is brilliant. The humor is both bold, and subtle. The
characters are archetypal.

Matilda perfectly captures what it is like to be an intelligent person,
trapped in the body of a child, and surrounded by idiots who control
far too much of your life.

The notion that bad people (even adults) deserve to be punished for
their evil ways (even by children) is truly subversive. Any child who
suffered through the countless typical abuses of unthinking, uncaring,
and ignorant parents will truly love this movie. Those same unthinking,
uncaring, and ignorant parents will probably hate this movie, unless
they are wise enough to see the truth behind the fantasy.

Despite the difficulties Matilda faces, like all good fantasies this
movie has a wonderfully happy ending. I wish the same for all.

personally, i hate nauseatingly cute family movies, but this movie is great!
I went to see it in the theatre because i had read the book, but i thought
that it wouldn't even come close to it. But you know what? I enjoyed this
movie more than the novel! I thought it wouldn't be faithful to the book and
that it would have turned out to be one of those typical kids' movies, but
there's nothing "cute" about mrs. Trunchbull! This has got to be one of my
favorite films ever and it IS the best childrens' movie ever made. I
definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has his heart in the right
place!

"I'm smart your dumb, I'm big your little, I'm right your wrong and
there's nothing you can do about it!" What a catchphrase Â– I could use
that on my brother sometime but anyhow this was an influence on Matilda
that made her strong and prepared her for her turbulent time ahead at
school, especially with a nasty head teacher 'Miss Trunchbull'. Roald
Dahl had written this book to show that a small girl like Matilda can
show courage and get herself out of a bad situation, once the film had
been made, everything I can remember from the book was alive with a
sweet girl to a lazy Mum and Dad (played by Danny DeVito and Rhea
Perlman). I give this film 10/10.

One of my most highly-anticipated films, 'Matilda' is both a treat and a
disappointment. The casting of Mara Wilson as the title character is
ingenious - the little girl exudes the qualities set forth in Roald
Dahl's
classic. Unfortunately, the filmmakers apparently could not resist the
urge
to alter the book, in which Matilda is British and lives in a small
village.
The movie version, of course, depicts Matilda as American, but what's
worse,
that she lives in a larger area. This detracts somewhat from the bucolic
setting of the book, although not enough to create a starkly different
environment.

The casting of Embeth Davidtz as "Miss Honey" was another great choice.
While not what I had pictured from the book, Miss Davidtz captures the
warmth and energy of the young teacher. Pam Ferris, as the grotesque
"Miss
Trunchbull," is simply outstanding. Both her demeanor and her looks bring
the book's character alive.

'Matilda,' while straying from the book's true form, is still highly
enjoyable to watch, especially for those of us who have read the Dahl's
masterpiece. Those who enjoy 'Matilda' should also enjoy the movie
adaptation of ``The Witches," another Roald Dahl classic.

Hi hi!

Danny DeVito touches on the viewpoint of children - and their
imaginations - in this fantasy come to life: MATILDA.

Who of us as children didn't see the world in the powerful images of
youthful, innocent eyes? The horrific Agatha Trunchbull, the kindly
librarian, Mrs. Phelps? The annoying big brother 'Mikey', or the
wondrous, perfect teacher, Miss Honey? Who of us as children didn't see
that some things in life were wrong and wanted to put them right - if
only we had magic powers!

Life as a child is fantastic and happy and exciting and scary. And in
MATILDA we see all elements of childhood shine through by the
intentionally ridiculous, over-the-top performances of Danny DeVito
(Matilda's Dad), Rhea Perlman (Mom), and Pam Ferris (Ms. Trunchbull,
the principal).

And yes, there is a scary element to the movie: The chase in Ms.
Trunchbull's house; the "Chokey"; the spooky scene of Matilda taking
back "Lizzie Doll" from Ms. Trunchbull while "haunting" her house. But
this is the scariness of youth; shown from a safe distance for even the
young audience. And despite the scariness - which kids KNOW exists -
Matilda and Miss Honey and all their friends are victorious. Danny
DeVito has demonstrated a lesson well-learned from the Disney animated
films of yesteryear: The more evil the villain, the more noble and
victorious the heroine.

To miss seeing MATILDA is to miss a heart-warming, hand-clapping,
magical trip back to your childhood fantasies and ideals.

I believe this film best represents the themes behind Roald Dahl's
rather subversive children's literature. It follows the continuity of
both "The Witches" and "James and the Giant Peach," casting repulsive
Trunchbull into the roles of Grand High Witch and repulsive evil aunt,
with a bit of the ogre (especially during the chase in Magnus House).

It's also pretty obvious that J.K. Rowling had read Roald Dahl long
before she wrote the first of her Harry Potter books. I find it very
odd how few people have noted Roald Dahl's literary influence on the
spate of children's fantasy authors today. All the elements for Harry
are here, in Matilda, right down to her unpleasant 'Muggle' family --
the Wormwoods -- and a brutish, Dudley-like brother. 

And for the record, Mara Wilson does a good job!
<|_=00=_|>

Critics always get away with giving a lot of good movies the bad ratings.
Matilda was one of them.

I happened to think Matilda was particularly great. 

Mara Wilson did good as the title character, except on some levels she acted
more like a kid, while more of an over-sophisticated teen on other levels.
The only thing missing in her future is a part as the star character in yet
another Alice in Wonderland project.

Pam Ferris seemingly got the part of Ms. Truchbull for an obvious reason. No
offense, but she's UGLY!! That best fit Ms. Trunchbull's personality.

Danny DeVito was sort of trying to put a one-man act in the film. He was
Matilda's dad, the director, and one of the producers.

The other actors/actresses, Rhea Perlman, Embeth Davidtz, Brian Levinson,
etc. did good as those they were acting as. That's what made this movie so
wonderful. The casting was the right price.

Again, the producers decided to wait until the original story writer passed
away before making a movie from one of his works. The British story was
somehow modified into an American perspective. One thing most people don't
understand is how advanced Matilda's content is, even though it was probably
intended for kids. That doesn't make it a bad thing; movies have to appeal
to everyone in general, not just little kids. 

But other than that, Matilda was a real treat.
<|_=00=_|>
I can't say 'Matilda' was one of my favorite Roald Dahl books as a
child but the movie adaption isn't that bad. 

Matilda is a very bright and intelligent for a girl of her age. She's
quite different from her grouchy and ignorant parents. Danny DeVito was
good as Matilda's grouchy father, he often plays very grouchy
characters. Mrs Trunchbull is as scary as she is in the book. She's
worse than mean. She's a deranged and aggressive monster! She's an
absolute monster! She hates children and does nothing except bully and
intimidate them. 

As for Mrs Jennifer Honey she's the exact opposite of Mrs Trunchbull.
She's kindest and sweetest teacher you could find. She's like a mother
to her school children and tries to protect them, but unfortunately she
to is intimidated by Mrs Trunchbull. So when Matilda develops these
telekinetic powers, it is up to her to teach Mrs Trunchbull an ultimate
lesson. 

I really liked the relationship Matilda has with Mrs Honey. It reminds
me of the relationships I had with certain teachers at school. So I
would say this movie is both frightening and touching at the same time.

My daughters (ranging from age 9-16) have loved this movie for several
years. I am normally a very sensitive person and wasn't disturbed by
the macabre tone of the movie. Somehow the movie remains upbeat as
Matilda is able to find someone who will love her even though her
parents don't appreciate her. Young Mara Wilson shines as Matilda. Each
time I watch this I am amazed at her talents at such a young age. I
haven't heard of her making any films lately...I hope this is by her
own choice. 

In addition, Danny DeVito, Rhea Perlman, Pam Ferris, and Embeth Davidtz
all were wonderful in their roles as Matilda's parents, principal and
teacher, respectively. I have read the book, and yes, it is different
as far as the setting goes, but in my opinion, they've kept the main
ideas quite intact. Movies are almost never the same as books, because
by definition they can't be. We have enjoyed watching this as a family
for at least 5 years now and will continue to. I just wish they'd
release a special edition DVD with COMMENTARY. I'd love to hear from
Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman about the making of this someday classic
movie. At least it is in my family. My criterion for a classic? We are
constantly quoting its script to each other.

UPDATE: They DID release a special edition. It does have some fine
extras, but I have to wonder why in the world didn't they offer a
widescreen edition? That is a big disappointment.
<|_=00=_|>
Kids nothing, I am 22 and I still love this movie. Unfortunate that it
does not get played more often.

I really can't think of any kid who would not want to be Matilda in
this movie. Though she basically gets treated like dirt her whole life,
she discovers that she can get even.

To this day, the Trenchbolt lady still freaks me out. The scene where
she throws the girl over the fence is burned into my brain. Really
scares me just how much Matilda's family reminds me of my idiot cousin
who had two kids by the time she was my age. The moral of the story is
this, having kids you don't want is never a good idea. It will wreck
your life, and it will wreck your kid's life.
