Kids is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's funny, horrific, but realistic. 

Despite the cast having no previous acting experience, the performances are
all wonderful, especially Justin Pierce's (as Casper). The realistic story
line, the classic dialogue, and the horrific finale are the film's best
features.

What bothers me is that many people discredit the film. Saying that the
movie is exploitation, or something even more ridiculous. I think that
people are unable to except the fact that Kids is accurate. Not all
teenagers behave like Telly or Casper, but you'd be lying if you said that
teenagers don't talk like that. 

Kids is not exploitation, but rather a brutally honest piece of social
commentary. Kids is a deterrent for high risk sexual behavior. The film is
also a wake up call for insensitive parents who take no responsibility for
their children. 

Therefore, Kids is a truthful portrayal of urban life.  it is not
exploitation.

Larry Clark has broken the boundaries with this film. Not only is it
one of the realist depictions of our nation's youth, but it also brings
the fear of the AIDS virus closer to home. This is not a piece of
fictitious work, this is brutal honesty in its rawest form. While many
will knock this film because of the pornographic nature, I saw past
that and witnessed the birth of the next plague. Writer Harmony Korine
has taken the world of our children and transferred it to the big
screen. I never once saw this as a shock film or disgusting, I saw
honesty and truth behind every scene. This is really what is happening
in our backyards. Kids are not as young as they used to be, and are
growing up in a world with more possibilities and distractions than
ever before. This is the modern world, and these are the newest
leaders. 

While this is not what happens with all of our youth, it does paint a
beautiful picture of just a handful. This is not just a story about
NYC, it is a message for every city. This is happening all over this
country. In the wealthy, poor, and everything in-between, our children
are experimenting without any form of education or realization of their
actions. 

This is not a film that will leave a very good taste in your mouth, but
then again it isn't supposed to. This is better and more honest than
any reality program out there and it will scare the daylights out of
you. This is our world, we must change it.

Grade: ***** out of *****

The first real thing anyone can do when watching an expose on certain
aspects of American culture is to ask yourself a very hard question,
"Is this real?"

I had to do that with this film.

Watching Larry Clark's 1995 film "Kids," an authentic and frightening
expose of some particularly callous and reckless teenagers in New York
City, one cannot wonder if the film is a brilliant commentary on the
state of America's youth or is a cleverly exploitive portrait of a
corrupted culture.

I believe the latter. It depicts, with stunning authenticity, the
chilling underside to a culture that abides by its own standards while
tossing away the teachings and hard-learned lessons of an elder
generation.

First of all, I wouldn't believe anyone who says that this movie is
hogwash or offers nothing close to a solution. Well, the first question
that people should ask themselves is, do they know anyone like the kids
in the movie? I do. I recently graduated from high school and I knew
several people who were quite like the kids in this film. This film set
out to do one thing: to show American parents, "Hey, these are your
kids. Do you know what they do when you're not around?"

Thoughtful people will ask themselves that. This is a film that
deserves a thoughtful audience as a thoughtful crew made it and took
the risks associated with bringing such harsh subject matter to the
screen.

Like last year's "Thirteen," "Kids" shows youth on the edge. These
"kids" are perfectly amoral and addicted. These kids aren't all right;
they're extremely dangerous.

There isn't a whole lot to the story, other than it chronicles an
eventful day in the life of Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick), his friend Casper
(Justin Pierce) and their inner-circle of similar-minded,
sex/drug-crazed associates. Telly has made it a duty to "deflower" as
many girls as possible and later brag to his friends about his latest
conquest; but by day's end, guaranteed, he would've done it again (a
record for him to do two girls in one day). The main conflict of the
story surfaces about 30 minutes in, when Jennie (Chloe Sevigny)
discovers that she had contracted HIV from Telly during their first
sexual encounter, and it becomes her mission to track him down before
another young girl shares her fate.

This is one powerful and dangerous film that is not for the faint of
heart, as it is authentically bleak. There is no hope for the
characters in the end; that is just how realistic this film is. The
film is also filled with shockingly real images, and a wall of furious
sound to drive home its key points. These are the kids of yesteryear,
the forgotten generation; these kids are America's worst nightmare
because they are young, dumb and just do not care; the fact that they
do not care makes them especially dangerous.

As I stated before, the imagery is extreme and frightening. If there
ever was an honest thing these kids ever did, it would have to be
willfully giving change to the less fortunate (a man with no legs who
rides a skateboard on the subway). We also get images of younger
children, swearing, drinking, smoking, talking like adults; trying to
fit in with their peers who are not much older than they are. I was
actually quite frightened by some baby pictures of our main character
and then I see what's on screen.

Then-newcomer Leo Fitzpatrick puts a face on a sleeping monster in
America: the doomed generation of young people that disregard older
generations completely and follow their own set of corrupted values.
Telly is reckless and stupid; it is impossible to really sympathize
with his character, even though we probably are. But it is difficult to
do so, mainly because of his preference for deflowering girls younger
than him (the first girl we see him with is only 12; he's about 15 or
16) and that could open up discussion for Telly possibly being a
borderline pedophile.

Where are the parents? One could very easily ask that question.
Strangely enough, Telly lives with his mother and baby brother. She is
the only parent in the film and she seems as every bit as irresponsible
as her misguided son.

Watching "Kids," I couldn't believe how real it is, how it sucks the
viewer into its dark, dangerous, and seductive world; it's easy to see
how a weak person could believe that what goes on in this movie is
cool. It begs the most fundamental question any responsible person
could ever ask, "Do you know where your children are?"

It is a question that every good parent should ask when their teenage
son or daughter steps out that front door and into the "real" world.

"Kids" Â– 10/10

<|_=00=_|>
I approached this expecting an explicit, controversial film for
controversy's sake -- something disturbing and, let's face it,
fabricated. I was surprised to find that yes, its aim is to make
parents lock their children in their bedrooms for the next fifty years
but also to truthfully examine modern-day childhood the way it really
is.

I knew kids like this, who talked like this, who listened to the
Beastie Boys and who bragged about anything sexual they could think of.
This movie follows the adventures and sexual pursuits of Telly, an
AIDS-infected young teen who goes around taking advantages of virgins.

We're led to believe Telly isn't aware of his disease but I think
perhaps he does and gets off on possibly spreading it to others. One of
his ex-girlfriends (Chloe Sevigny) becomes infected and spends the
entire movie looking for Telly to warn him before he has sex with a
young virgin.

The end of the movie is pretty tragic and quite sad really. Yes, it is
wrapped a bit too nicely in the sense that all this stuff happens to
one group of kids within a period of a day or so, but by compacting
many events into one scenario director Larry Clark makes quite a
compelling little film/semi-documentary.

One thing I should also mention is the dialogue, which I found to be
the most realistic in any kid-starring film I've ever seen. He didn't
just choose talented actors, he got the expressions, mannerisms and
jargon perfected -- as a result it does come across as a very
authentic, genuine film and even if you hate it, there's no denying
it's pretty sickening. Whether you find that a good or bad thing is
entirely up to you.
<|_=00=_|>

This film struck me in the heart, it made me feel terrible after seeing
it and any movie that can have a impact on me like that, I
congragulate. The film is almost like a documentary of a group of kids
in NYC. It probably isn't completely realistic but its believable. It is
a frightening wake up call to America.

If you want to be moved watch this film. The acting is great for a
group of rag-tag kids, they make the story really believable and
passionate. I do believe that Larry Clark has a strage obsession with
teenage nudity, in every film I've seen of his there has been tons of
teenagers having sex, sometimes it spoils the film.

Overall the film is powerful and moving, watch it.

I watched this movie with my dad. He did a bunch of stuff when he was
younger, but kids weren't as amoral back then as they are now. The sad
part for me was that nothing in the movie shocked me.I'd been there and
done that in a few cases...but never to the extreme that those kids
took it. I never hung out with people that acted like that, and i've
never publicly exploited myself like many of those girls did. It was
really sad for me to realize how accurate the movie was though. It
makes the movie "Thirteen" look like a Disney movie. The movie makes me
want to lock any future kids I end up having in a box, and not let them
out until they are 30. It's definitely a movie parents should see. I've
had way too many friends who's parents live this life of ignorance.
They turn their backs and deny that their children could be doing
anything wrong. It's true that you live and you learn, but the scary
thing is is that not all of the kids grow up and wake up.
<|_=00=_|>

Larry Clark has created a true masterpiece of its time.  Kids is an
insightful, poignant and harrowing depiction of the life of angst ridden
teens in New York City.  There's Tully, the smooth talking, de-flowering
(and HIV positive) teen, Casper, the cool, hyped up and not all there teen,
and Jennie, the girl who is full of depression and anger for the de-flower
man.  The film doesn't have much of a direct screenplay (mostly dialogue you
would hear while around friends) which is good for the type of movie being
made here.  The film gains much controversy by stating whether its true to
life, or just a mindless depiction of what could happen in the city.  You
could decide that for yourself, but for me, I think this film has more
truth, heart and drama (including great dramatic acting and scenes) that
most films I've ever seen.  
<|_=00=_|>
KIDS is a dead-on accurate portrayal of the troubled youth of our
times. But what a lot of people don't realize is this problem exists
not only in large cities like NYC, but is without a doubt a serious
problem in small towns. Homemade drugs and some '40s' followed by a
'roll in the hay' is the favorite Friday night pastime in a lot of
rural areas. In some ways, small town kids have a bigger risk because
the free clinics and youth programs available to kids in urban areas
don't reach out to the country. Kids and parents alike seem to share
the mentality of "that stuff just goes on in the cities". I grew up in
a town of less than 10,000, and there were kids exactly like Telly and
Casper in my high school- from the lingo and behavior right down to the
dirty, stretched out t-shirts.

AIDS aside, what I think is the scariest part of the movie is when
Telly and Casper go to Telly's house, and his mom is there. She takes
her parental duty as far as asking "where have you been?"- to which
Telly responds with a lie, saying they were out looking for jobs. The
audience knows they are lying, obviously- but you can tell the mother
doesn't really believe it either- she's just too lazy, or preoccupied
to bother with the whole thing. Pretty common occurrence among today's
parents.

KIDS should be a part of the required curriculum in Sex Education
classes for all high school freshmen. Any parent who believes the
vulgarity and sex and drugs is exaggerated or glorified is in need of a
serious wake up call. If it's not your kid doing these things, then
it's the one sitting next to him in class. And don't be so sure it
isn't your kid.

There are two highly, and deservedly, controversial movies dealing with
the issues of drug and alcohol abuse, underage sex, lack of control,
and the preteen and teenage minority of urban America. One of them is
"Kids" and the other is "Bully." The former is a haunting work of art;
the latter is a clunk of garbage. Both were directed by the same man,
Larry Clark. I saw "Bully" first about a year ago and I was blown out
of my mind by how offensive and atrociously cruel that movie was and
how it redeemed itself in no way. I initially condemned Mr. Clark as a
director and vowed never to see another movie of his again.

Then I happened to see the Siskel & Ebert review for his first movie
"Kids" and after much deliberation, decided to give this controversial
filmmaker a second chance. I am so glad that I did.

In many respects, "Kids" and "Bully" are much the same movie. They're
both frighteningly brutal, appalling in their explicit content and
vulgar dialogue, and they expose the nasty undercurrents in the younger
generations of today, especially in urban cities where parental control
(or control of any kind) seems all but present. So why is "Kids" a
great movie and "Bully" an awful one? Because while "Bully" only
pretended to have a purpose, "Kids" *has* a purpose and it never once
dumbs down on that. It's a sick and disgusting picture, but it's also
somewhat of a wake-up call. And I can fairly say now that as a reviewer
and film-goer, I can forgive Mr. Clark.

"Kids" is set in the drug-riddled streets of New York. We see very
little of parents, or adults for that matter, and focus on a group of
rambunctious, vulgarity-spitting, lecherous teenagers who are devoted
to getting drunk, abusing drugs, and giving away their virginity. The
most sickening of them is Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick). Not because he can
charm young girls enough to seduce them into deflowering them, but
because he's simultaneously signing their death warrants with the HIV
virus. One of his victims (Chloe Sevigny) discovers she has AIDS
because of her one-night stand with him and as she slowly suffers,
searches the city to confront him. Meanwhile, Telly is trying to seduce
his next victim while he and a group of other nasty individuals roam
unsupervised through a place as horrific as any drug underworld. More
shocking is that this is just a day in the life for them.

Even more shocking is the daunting realization that this is one hundred
percent accurate and we must commend Mr. Clark and screenwriter Harmony
Korine, the latter in particular. His screenplay is the core of why
this picture is so powerful. He writes his dialogue without any
apparent flow or structure, as if the behavior of his characters are
not even up to him. The actions of the characters are unpredictable, as
they would be. I also really commend him for his choice to not close up
with an obligating-style ending, but to choose a really haunting,
crusher of one instead. And Mr. Clark shoots his film in a strong,
visual-focused documentary approach with long takes from his camera
swinging back and forth between the gossiping teenagers. He also pays
good attention to their surroundings, showing the conditions and lack
of concern from their peers and elders that resulted in their being
this way. Because he has a screenplay that is focused and sharp
("Bully" did not) his movie has a purpose and even his seemingly
pornographic shots have a purpose as well.

The content is oftentimes appalling, but it also has a purpose. This
time I must appreciate Mr. Clark's boldness and reluctance to be
contrived. Whereas I got the sense he was indulging the drug use and
sex in "Bully," here he clearly defines his intentions of turning our
stomachs. These particular kids are scum and they are a product of
their scummy environment. He wants to show us that. So the scenes of
underage sex are jaw-dropping. They do not turn on the audience; they
appall. Furthermore, he does not flood the screen with images of naked
teenage bodies and relies on our imagination at crucial moments to
exploit the real horror. He balances the explicit and implicit with
professional craftsmanship.

"Kids" is a very tough movie to watch and tough to enjoy, but I must
confess that it is, to my mind, a truly great film. As I sat there
watching it, I was appalled and disgusting and flabbergasted, but at
the same time, I was drawn in. Mr. Clark's brilliant portrait of the
bad side of humanity in our younger generation grips you by the throat
and he never lets go. Not once. He's also got some very strong
performances from his cast which include Leo Fitzpatrick, a very young
Rosario Dawson, Chloe Sevingy, and the late Justin Pierce whose
brilliant performance reminds me so much of the scumbags that I had the
displeasure to know in my adolescent years. I personally managed to
avoid their paths of life and now looking at "Kids," I am even more
thankful that I did.

This is not a super super film, but it stays with you, which was sort
of the point - especially if you saw it at the time it was released,
before the onslaught of "dark" teen movies over the decade following.
This was the granddaddy of the genre and remains one of the darkest and
grittiest of them all, in both subject and style. Perhaps in part
because the subjects were an urban group of kids, rather than the
angsty suburban set we've grown accustomed to seeing, there is a rare
and truthful ferocity to the characterizations. The emotive mechanism
isn't their redemption as mere children, but their total fallibility as
young adults. Though obviously this represents a small sample of
teenagers in the united states, it will make you think twice about how
much earlier we seem to lose our childhood these days. Great ensemble
cast with very believable performances. Its attempt to approximate the
reality of a documentary is a unique success. In addition to stong
dialogue and direction, credit should be given to the cast for that;
obviously, chloe sevigny was a standout here. A really important
subject for its time and a very credible portrayal.
