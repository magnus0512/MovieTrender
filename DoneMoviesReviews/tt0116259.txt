When I saw "Extreme measures" for the first time I didn't expect anything
special from it. Just a basic thriller among others and that's pretty much
it. However as it turned out, "Extreme measures" has a certain place in my
top 10 of "the best suspense movies of the 90's". I think this movie has
never received all the recognition it deserves. "Extreme measures" delivers
excellent acting, fascinating plot, cool action and lots of excitement and
most important of all, it gives birth to a rather interesting ethical
question.

The story gets deeper and deeper and film really keeps the viewer in the
edge of the seat. In the end even the bad guy (splendidly played by Gene
Hackman) turns out to be, how should I put it...a "good" bad guy. If you
haven't seen this thriller yet, I must say that I envy you because naturally
the experience is the most impressive in the first time around when you
haven't heard too much about this and haven't got a slightest idea what to
expect. The less you know about this film in advance, the better. Actually I
feel that even the mere trailer uncovers too much. Watch it, enjoy
it.

Despite lead actor Hugh Grant still riding high from his sleeper hit
FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL and a well publicized arrest for curb
crawling in Hollywood the previous year, this was not received well in
the theaters. Even with the support from the ever versatile Gene
Hackman the movie was a box office flop! It's important to state from
the outset that the film itself is pretty good and deserved better than
it got, not just from the standard of movies that were around but also
because it was well acted and raised some very important moral and
medical questions that to some extent are more relative today with the
controversy over stem cells than it was ten years ago! 

As for why the movie bombed I cant really say, perhaps not enough guns,
sex and violence or maybe the theme or scenario was very depressing to
many people. Also I think that being a thriller, actor George Cloony
who was a lead in the popular medical soap ER would have been a better
box office draw than Grant. Clooney who was struggling to break into
the "AÂ– list" of movie stars at the time would have been believable as
a doctor and the movie it self would have elevated him faster up to
stardom than the duffers he did at around that time! However, it has to
be said this is only as far as being a better box office draw, Cloony
of course being American. It has to be said Hugh Grant was very good in
this part and I think it was one of his best films. Grant was and still
is better known for comedy or a romantic lead not a tough guy roles or
action films, so perhaps this is why many in his fan base did not take
to his character because it was a thriller not a comedy.

Having said that he was very well cast for the part and on many
occasions was able to display his dead pan dry wit and came across
quite believable as the out of towner Dr. from the UK who didn't know
what he was getting into. His character was typical Grant in the USA
not aloof and pompous, but just a little awkward, slightly eccentric
maybe and disorganized! I think that coming from England only made the
character come across as more vulnerable and isolated as events
unraveled and things seemed to conspire against him. When the well
respected Dr. Myrick (Gene Hackman) decided that Dr. Luthan's (Hugh
Grant) meddling was proving to be problematic as well as inconvenient,
Luthan's feeling of paranoia towards his colleagues was more
believable. No tough guy or macho part was needed here!

Grant played Guy Luthan who was deemed for great things in the medical
profession is a physician who encounters a distraught and frightened
patient who had been found wandering the streets. He is extremely
agitated, suffering convulsions and has strange legations at the base
of his spine. Despite desperate attempts to save his life the
mysterious patent dies. Luthan who is shocked over what he has
witnessed is puzzled by a silver bracelet on the wrist which indicates
that the patient (Claude Minkins) was probably a hospital patient
somewhere and starts to make inquires. He orders blood work and lab
analysis despite the fact that patient has no medical insurance (much
to the annoyance of his superiors). When he can not find the hospital
that used silver a bracelet and is concerned about the bizzar results
in the lab report, he then delves further into this case much to the
disdain of colleges and top faculty administrators. It appears that the
patient was homeless and his medical records wiped and put in storage
where he is unable to track them.

Then the body mysteriously disappears, the chief residence is very
nonchalant about it and berates and scolds Luthan in very dismissive
and casual manner over his concern, this only leads him to become more
suspicious. Soon he feels that he can't trust anybody as it appears
that some are trying to thwart his own investigations. He is correct,
------ some within the hospital as well as outside are trying to
frustrate his efforts in unraveling this mystery. Rather than back off,
he let's his curiosity get the better off him, puts his professional
reputation on the line which only results in disastrous consequences
for him personally. Realizing that he is really on to something and now
with nothing to lose he becomes even more determined to track down who
is responsible for trying to ruin him, ------ but more importantly why?

This movie raises medical and moral issues over the balance of patient
care and medical advancement. This is not a new topic, the earlier
movie COMA and many or medial shows since have dabbled with this
dilemma but the ending in this movie leaves that question strangely
unanswered? (Interestingly, at the beginning of the movie Luthan has an
ethical dilemma of his own. While working in the ER he has to decide
who gets the priority for the only OR room available at the time. It's
a choice between a wounded Cop and the and the 'perp' who shot him, who
incidentally is in a more serious condition. He decides that the cop
should get priority)!

Hugh Grant was good, so was Hackman and fine support from Sara Jessica
-Parker, David Morse and Paul Guilfoyle. I would highly recommend this
movie!

I just saw this for the second time, on telly, and was struck again by how
good it is; not great, maybe, but a very solidly written and acted film on
an intriguing premiss and leaving the viewer a bit of room to make up their
own mind (this is a GOOD THING, in case anyone is wondering).  Hugh Grant
shows again that he can do more than play variations on this 4 Weddings
character - anyone who has seen An Awfully Big Adventure will be well aware
of this.  And Gene Hackman is as excellent as ever.  A word for Elizabeth
Hurley, who produced the film, and I think it was her first: a damn good job
she did, despite some unsavoury sniping in the British press about her.  I'd
give it an 8 out of 10
<|_=00=_|>

A movie starring Hugh Grant, Gene Hackman and David Morse is a "must-see"
for me. Extreme Measures is a thriller, and it does its job well - it is
thrilling. On top of that the director managed to put me in a moral dilemma.
There was a point in the movie, where I could not decide whether "the bad
guy" really was such a bad guy. I think that this sounds very confusing, but
watch the movie and decide for yourself. "The bad guy's" motives aren't bad
at all, it is just the way he does it! A thrilling, although a bit slow
movie at times. I voted 7/10.

Very exciting film with lots of surprises. Not really all that original, I
have run across the story of the mad doctor wanting to play God before.
Still it was well done, and the ending left me wondering..... Hugh Grant
and
Gene Hackman were, as usual, flawless in their performances, as was the
entire cast.

This movie is very relevant in this day and age with the on slot of
diseases and people who are searching for the answers. Hugh Grant
playing the moral side of this left and right medical thriller. The big
question brought up in this film is that of medical morals that have
been brought up in many movies and in the thoughts of many people, "
Would you kill many people to save lives in the name of medicine?"

Hugh Grant is amazing as the hero Doctor Guy Luthan. His character
works feverishly to find the truth of," What is going on with this
mysterious men that come into his life, why his life is being destroyed
and what is "Triphase"?" This is a good movie of Hugh Grant's and shows
how he works well as a serious actress which I think he should go back
to. 

Go rent this movie or check HBO for the next time it appears.

While it hardly offers any twists that we haven't seen before, "Extreme
Measures" is a well-made, well-acted thriller that has an unusual air of
believability. The most effective set piece, which doesn't have all that
much to do with the main plot, is the hero's descent into the underground
lairs beneath the Grand Central Station. Hugh Grant is very convincing and
unaffected in one of his most serious roles, and the ending is not as
cut-and-dried as you might expect it to be. But the most memorable moment,
for me at least, occurs early on, when a very ill and frightened man, barely
able to speak, looks straight into Grant's eyes, pleading for help.

Hugh Grant stars a ER doctor that happens upon a patient with complex
medical issues (and dies). His tests reveal something quite unusual.

Gene Hackman plays a well-respected medical researcher that has a
secret research lab using the homeless to find cures to diseases.
Thought provoking to say the least.

Grant's character is ruined after he starts digging into the mystery of
this dead patient's maladies, medical mysteries. He just doesn't know
what sinister medical research he stumbled upon and who is involved.

Sarah Jessica Parker was okay in the film but Grant made it work. Liz
Hurley was actually a Producer of the film. Hackman played his
character okay but not excellent as usual.

It is a taught medical thriller than will make you think if medical
research like the Nazi's is really going on in real life. The movie was
ahead of its time.

Micheal Apted directed it well. Lots of great supporting actors.

I just watched this movie on TV and my mind is reeling with the ethical
dilemma it raises.  I thought I'd watch it while I did the ironing but I
only got a couple of items done because I was glued to the
movie!

I must admit also I wondered what sort of a job Hugh Grant would do in a
role much more serious than we usually see, but...surprise!  He is
thoroughly convincing as a young surgeon troubled by some things that don't
add up in the Emergency Room, troubled enough to investigate further,
risking his career and ultimately his life to find out what is going
on.

Definitely worth a look!

A thriller in the medical world. Generally, doctors abide by the
Hippocratic Oath - roughly summarized as "to do good or to do no harm".
Hugh Grant as the English Doctor strives to uphold this. Gene Hackman
plays the role of the medical researcher, now head of a powerful
medical research foundation that can influence police and politicians,
believes that medical research is more important than "to do no harm"
if in the long run research does provide valuable improvements to
medicine. Hackman is the ominous shadow of the German Nazi doctors,
1935-1945, such as Josef Mengele, who carried out abominable medical
experiments in order to promote so-called medical advancement. Thus the
conflict between Grant and Hackman: Grant the loner, a promising
English doctor - a follower of the Hippocratic Oath, thus the moral
man, is working temporarily in America to gain valuable medical
experience. Hackman, the countervailing force, the ominous medical
power with wide ranging influence in public power circles, controls the
lives of his captured patients in underground "catacombs", disregarding
their concerns in order to achieve his results for the "benefit of
mankind" . Sudden deaths, escapes, mysterious liaisons, threats, moral
arguing (but only a little as this in a modern American film -
historically there was plenty of moral arguing), shootings, and of
course plenty of blood are the powerful ingredients to this cocktail.
Grant certainly knows how to play convincingly other roles than those
"English" ones which rocketed him to the top. Hackman as always is a
master of his role. Well worth seeing!
