You'd think that a movie with the acting power of Nick Nolte, Jeff Bridges,
and Sharon Stone would be one to watch. Well.......it is and it
isn't.

First off, I'd never in my life thought I'd see Nolte and Bridges in the
same movie. Talk about an odd pairing!

With that out of the way, they both put in good performances, as does Stone.
The star of this movie though is Albert Finney. His performance is the best
of all the parts in this movie.

Unfortunately the plot, involving a racing scam many years ago which
resurfaces, is only mildly interesting at best. It seems almost a shame to
have such good performances wasted on such a story. Still, it's worth a
watch if nothing else is on.

When 5 past Oscar nominees headline a movie, naturally, one would have
rather high expectations. Such is the case with `Simpatico' a high-profile
drama which went by relatively un-noticed when it was released 3 or 4 years
ago. But I am surprised that it only received a 4.4 rating on the IMDb. I'm
not saying that the film was a classic or deserved enormous critical
plaudits, but I definitely think that it deserved more than that. It is an
adaptation of the stage play written by Sam Shepard. While it starts out
promising, it is also surprisingly bland when it reaches the conclusion.

But the main problem is the lack of simple definition. It's hard to tell if
this is a simple story, or a more complex one. It's unclear whether this is
a film about friends reconciling or friends being torn apart by guilt. The
film tries going both ways, but the result is a puzzling one to say the
least. One thing that it avoids doing is falling into plot-holes, becoming
predictable or using average movie clichés. This is done by creating
thoroughly flawed but also very compelling characters that certainly aren't
your average stereotypes. And they are lifted off paper by exceptional
performances from the three Oscar nominated lead players.

Nick Nolte (Affliction, The Prince of Tides) gives yet another top-notch
performance as the untrustworthy hobo. Jeff Bridges (The Last Picture Show,
The Contender) is also very good as his polar opposite- the eccentric
millionaire. About two-thirds the way through the movie, the two main
character switch places for no apparent reason. It doesn't make logical
sense why a millionaire would choose to live like a bum, just because
someone stole his wallet. Both actors are better and more believable in
their opening personas.

Sharon Stone (Casino) makes her first appearance in the movie at about the
halfway mark. It's a shame she didn't appear earlier, because it's
surprising how convincing she is as the rich and wrecked housewife. She's so
far away from the icy sex-goddess of `Basic Instinct' it's hard to believe
that this is the same actress. Albert Finney (Tom Jones, Erin Brockovich)
makes great support, but Catherine Keener (Being John Malkovich) gives the
blandest and most over-rated performance. Not only is her part boring and
un-necessary, but she even over-acts in certain scenes.

Unfortunately, there are some evident flaws scattered around here and there.
The `big twist' is uninteresting and it's ironic that Sharon Stone and Jeff
Bridges are never on the screen at the same time- After all, their
characters are supposed to be husband and wife! But the brilliant acting
alone makes `Simpatico' qualify as a good if un-remarkable movie. The script
is below average and sometimes the movie ventures into blandness, but most
other aspects are good as expected. My IMDb rating: 6.1/10.

Somewhere buried deep inside the mess that is `Simpatico' there lurk the
makings of a pretty decent little love story.  Unfortunately, one would have
to eliminate pretty much the entire main storyline and all the major
characters in order to find it.  

This tale of `three people caught in a web of their own making' is so
thoroughly inept, overwrought and inconsequential that it seems more like a
parody of film noir than a serious entry in the genre.   The crime that
these three people perpetrated in their youth  the one that keeps coming
back to haunt them in their approaching middle-age - seems a piddling one at
best for a film of this type.  An even more serious problem is that the
three lead performers seem stuck in roles that have come to define their
métier as actors.  Nick Nolte, for instance, plays his customary
down-and-out, barely-teetering-on-the-edge-of-sanity middle aged loser whose
capricious nature makes him forever a threat to the security of the group,
while Jeff Bridges portrays the common sense, constantly put-upon ringleader
who just wants to forget all about the past but who has a hard time keeping
a leash on the unpredictable Nolte.   Sharon Stone completes the trio as
Bridges' now moody, alcoholic wife  a pale imitation of her much more meaty
role in Martin Scorcease's `Casino.'  Stone's over-the-top thespian
simpering reduces the (fortunately) few scenes she is in to the level of
unintentional high comedy.  Moreover, in their attempt to provide a dual
level structure to their tale  crosscutting scenes of the past with scenes
of the present  the filmmakers have been forced to employ actors who look
nothing like their contemporary counterparts.  The result is, initially,
confusing and, ultimately, quite ludicrous.

What is most strange about `Simpatico' is that, while the story itself
fizzles and the audience could care less what happens to these three
whining, puling, muking central characters, writer/director Matthew Warchus
and co-author David Nicholls somehow manage to create a back story and two
minor characters who engage both our sympathy and our interest.  These come
in the form of the always splendid Albert Finney as the man our intrepid
band of halfwit con men managed to entrap into an extortion scheme twenty
years earlier, and the charming Catherine Keener as the highly principled
grocery store cashier who finds herself unwittingly a pawn in Bridges' plot
to rein Nolte in.  Finney and Keener provide so much warmth and humanity in
their few scenes together that we find ourselves regretting that the film
does not revolve around them entirely.  Wisely, after we wheeze our way
through all the hullabaloo and nonsense necessary to bring the main plot to
its ludicrous conclusion, Warchus closes the film with a coda focused on
these two winning characters.  The finale, in some inexplicable way, seems
more like a beginning than an ending and we find ourselves wanting to see
what happens to this offbeat, likeable couple.  By wasting our time
concentrating on the Nolte/Bridges/Stone triumvirate of insipidity, the
filmmakers end up making us feel even more resentful in the long run.  Like
the victims of the trio's racetrack shenanigans, we feel
robbed!

I'm surprised at the negative comments on a movie that I found, if not
a favorite, somehow **important** to watch. Every character, save
Catherine Keener's (Cecilia), is basically a person who is broken on
some level. American audiences are so used to the Hollywood formula of
clear cut good guys and bad guys and people who overcome, story lines
that have clear cut endings where the good guys win and the bad guys
pay, where everything makes sense in the end. This is not one of those
movies and it's not the way real life is anyway. If the ending doesn't
make sense in that way, it does give the impression that by the end of
the movie, the characters are on the precipice of finally finding some
peace in their lives even though the audience won't get to see it.

Viewers complain that the story meanders or makes no sense and that
they don't understand the characters. I didn't find this to be true
either. They were very easy to understand and the storyline ties
together past events (shown in flashbacks to their youth) and the
results of their actions--guilt, relationships torn apart, **everyone**
paying (not just the bad guys) while trying desperately to reconcile
with themselves and one another to find that it's not so easy to do so.
Rather than "meandering", I found the story to be shown in a very
linear fashion and that exposition is given bit by bit until it ties
together at the end.

One of the complaints that I found in reviews and on the message board
is how Lyle, the one that attained wealth through their shady methods,
ends up quitting, walking away from his money in what appears to be an
"all of a sudden" fashion. By the end of the movie, after his story is
told in flashback, it made perfect sense to me that he wanted to walk
away for a long time and this was finally his opportunity to grab it.
His reasoning, talking to his wife on the phone, "No more %*@#! lies!"
and that "it's the smell of the alfalfa" said it all. He just wanted to
go back (perhaps to his youth) before all of the nightmare began and
start over. Makes perfect sense. I think it's difficult for some people
to comprehend that someone would choose meaning in their life over
money or that there are perhaps rich people out there that may have
fantasies of walking away from it all. I just don't find that hard to
believe.

Nick Nolte's character, Vincent, is probably the most difficult one to
comprehend because his is the most screwed-up and in the most pain.
Because of his actions when young, his obtuse reaction at the time to
his then girlfriend (and now Lyle's wife, Rosie, played by Sharon
Stone) through in what I'll call "the event that tore them all apart"
and his part in it along with his clumsy and confused attempt at
rectifying it with Rosie (and Simms), make his character the most
uncomfortable to watch. It's not because the part is badly written or
badly played (Nick Nolte plays the part to perfection). It's just
because this guy is **supposed** to be uncomfortable to watch.

The worst things I can say about it is that there isn't enough Sharon
Stone in it. I'm not a big fan of hers but she is a dynamic actress and
her character deserved more presence while most of her story is shown
in flashback with a younger actress. Catherine Keener isn't given
enough praise for her part because her character is the only "ordinary"
and somewhat sane person in the midst of all this and so **appears**
less interesting although I didn't feel it was. I think that is the
purpose that that character serves--as a sort of reflection to it all.
Albert Finney, as the crooked race commissioner who makes one mistake
too many and loses the things that matter, is also a prize to watch.
But then he always is.

While this movie isn't a "pick-me-up" kind of thing, I found it
intriguing.
<|_=00=_|>
I really don't know where to start. The characters weren't that
believable at all. The development they have gone through (as you see
them in their youth as well) and the development they go through during
the movie just doesn't make sense to me.

And the plot, you can smell something similar to a plot here and there,
but that is as close as you get. The first 15-20 minutes it works, it
feels like an ordinary movie. But then it just breaks down and you
wonder what the message is, what the story is, what the heck this movie
is supposed to convey.

In summary it's a pointless flick that doesn't strike any chords in me
anyway.
<|_=00=_|>

Like the race-horse of the title, the cast in this dark, eccentric tale are
pure thoroughbreds...Nick Nolte, Jeff Bridges, Albert Finney,Kathryn
Keener,
Sharon Stone along with up and comer Shawn Hatosy. And though the director,
Matthew Warchus, appears to be a first time helmer, his handling of these
pros is sure-footed. Warchus also does an impressive job of steering us
through a complex plot with sure, visual dexterity. SIMPATICO, from a
script
by Warchus, based on a Sam Shepard play, really isn't about horse-racing.
It's an entertaining exploration of betrayal, survival and how the simple
passage of time changes the whole equation. 
<|_=00=_|>

Tale of long-past racing scam resurfacing to change the diverse lives of
its
perpetrators and victims isn't particularly subtle, with transformations
and
transferences flying around like abandoned betting slips, but it's very
well
acted by a dream cast (no less engaging for the fact that they don't all
seem to be in quite the same film)
and never loses its basic finesse. In its early stretches, as the pieces
of
the plot fall into place, the film builds a highly effective sense
of
escalating jeopardy, and the initial gambits on the theme of identity
and
impermanence are effective, leveling out a bit as thematic
considerations
seem to overtake the characters. Still, it has a sleek poise, and
debuting
director Warchus shows a distinct nose for the finish line - the
film's
closing scenes seem about right on their own terms, even if you're not
sure
about all the stuff that led you there (the horse Simpatico for instance
seems ultimately to be carrying more symbolic weight than the course of
the
film supports).
<|_=00=_|>

I really enjoyed watching "Simpatico". I liked it so much I bought the
movie. Jeff Bridges, and Nick Nolte are at their best. At times my heart
did
bleed for Nolte. Yet Jeff's character too drew my sympathy, but it was the
horse who I felt the most saddened for. Even though it's an excellent
movie,
I would caution a parent against letting a child watch it, if the child
was
unable to tell the difference between reality, and fiction. It pulls at
the
heart strings in much the same way as "Old Yeller". It covers love, lies,
greed, and true friendship in one brilliantly wrapped package. It is a
beautiful, heart warming, and intriguing movie. A must see if you are a
Jeff
Bridges fan.

What is this 4.4 rating by 2348 users? Where did this come from? Not
enough car chases? 

This is a good movie, well written. One could criticize a bit a sort of
awkwardness or heaviness in the technical aspect of movie making, due
to a first film or an approach maybe too theatrical, but the directing
is good. It plainly deserves a minimum of 6.5 for its artistic value.
Maybe Matthew Warchus is more a stage director and too keen on good
directing than finding a picturesque way with images to illustrate
something he has already staged.

If films about horses are to be considered, "Simpatico" is much better
than "Dead Heat" (rated 5.3), different from "Seabiscuit" (rated 7.3)
because it does not carry hope against odds being more of a drama about
betrayal, and better than the totally unrealistic "Hidalgo" (rated 6.6)
who has never been in the Sahara, but it does show a chase.

Why consider it as a film about horses? Because it also is a film about
a horse, magnificent as opposed to human behavior in this story, as far
as the only pure character in this movie, named by its title, is the
horse Simpatico, and maybe this is the side that should have been
enhanced more in opposition with the corruption of all this human
horse-racing scam, since human perversion finally kills him, and what's
more, because he his becoming sterile. 

Maybe the overall realism, that had to be detailed more in the movie
than the play, brought too many necessary plot details that might have
obscured the existence of the character Simpatico, although every time
we see him, his beauty reminds us of his existence as metaphor,
metaphor that might have been more powerful on the stage, just by being
permanent but never visible.

I suggest a 6.5 as a minimum.

This is not a great film but it deserves some attention.

I am an admirer of Sam Shepard the writer, not necessarily the actor. And
even though his contribution to the film is not direct, his subjects make an
impact on me. I am surprised the director did not involve him in the
screenplay. Of course, Shepard is more a playwright than a
screenplaywriter...

I loved all the main players, especially Sharon Stone. She had a small role
that was impressive.

The camerawork of John Toll always impresses; this film was no
exception.

One thing was clear; the direction lacked experience--but for a first film,
the output is creditable.
