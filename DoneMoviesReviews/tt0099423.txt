For those who argue that Die Hard 2 is a desperate re-hash of the
original... So what?  I didn't expect a companion piece like The Godfather
Part II.  Die Hard was about a really cool guy in a really bad situation,
and the result was probably the greatest action movie ever made.  Die Hard 2
achieves status on its own just by being about the same thing. When so many
movies want to be Die Hard but fail, why not just make another Die Hard?
Director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger)realized that because it's a sequel,
there had to be more stunts and explosions. So there is.  Die Hard 2
(appropriately called Die Harder) ups the ante a bit and has fun with a
flurry of furious action scenarios.  The fight on the wing of the plane is a
classic in its own right, and Die Hard 2 stands alone as one of the best of
the genre.  
<|_=00=_|>

I have watched many movies where they have had a sequel which left me
disappointed and uneasy, but the sequel to the smash, Die Hard, Die Hard 2
(Die Harder) was what think a sequel should be - more of what made the first
film so successful. So itÂ‘s all out war for unlucky Police Detective named
McClane, in a heart-stopping, jet-propelled journey through excitement and
terror.

On a snowy Christmas Eve in the nation's capital, a team of terrorist have
seized a major international airport, and now holds thousands of holiday
travellers hostage. The terrorists, a renegade band of crack military
commandos led by murderous rogue officer, have come to rescue a drug lord
from justice. They've prepared for every contingency, except one: John
McClane, an off-duty cop seized by a feeling of deadly deja vu. The heroic
cop not only has to battle terrorists, but also an incompetent airport
police chief, the hard headed commander of the army's anti-terrorist squad
and a deadly winter snowstorm. The runways are littered with death and
destruction, and McClane is in a race against time. His wife is trapped on
one of the planes circling somewhere overhead, desperately low on
fuel!

Die Hard 2 makes Bruce Willis look better and better. The role of John
McClane is one filled with the fight for right and to trying to stop the bad
guys. Again a lot of the stunts would have been done by Willis considering
the professionalism of the man. Running all over an airport in a fierce
snowstorm, fighting scenes on the wing of a real 747 jet and trying to save
lives he has no attachment to, L.A. cop John McClane puts his body on the
line, so justice is served and so did the actor Bruce Willis in my view to
bring a great action movie back for a second time. Willis is one of my
favourite actors, but I have only started to watch his movies in about the
last 2-3 years and what a mistake that has been.   

This film has more freedom as it is held at an airport. McClane is like I
have said all over the place. The freedom and space this story has makes
this film much easier to watch. Another thing which is impressive about Die
Hard 2 is the effort to put more thrills in the movie. The snow (which of
course is man made) has a major role, so do all the planes making quite a
crisis on their hands. Not only do they fight on the wing of a 747, but also
fly a real helicopter on the wing of the plane also. The scene where McClane
ejects himself from the exploding plane is another favourite scene of mine.
Other parts of this movie which stunned me I wont tell you about as it will
give too much away, but trust me they are exceptionally
done.

Again the bad guys have a major role in this one. William Saddler is
Colonial Stuart, a heartless leader, who only cares that a drug lord escapes
and can get in on all the money making scheme. I loved his role in this.
Another face that I remember in Die hard 2 who was a bad guy is Robert
Patrick. I loved his role in Terminator 2. But the conflict between the good
guys is extremely tense. Especially between McClane and Police Officer
Lorenzo played by L.A law star Dennis Franz. It is hard to understand if
this character is on the side for good or not. 

Here comes another analogy on Die Hard 2, do you ever know who is on the
side of good or bad? Well for at least three quarters of the film it is
unsure. The storywriters need to be commended because the story left me
intrigued and when you think you know what is about to happen, the
circumstances change. Also having a different director, gave this sequel new
prospective. Director Renny Harlin threw his hand into the ring. What a
gamble? An unknown director, but to my surprise I say that it worked. His
other films worth mentioning include A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 and
Cliffhanger. 

So overall Die Hard 2 was extremely enjoyable sequel to watch. The story,
the characters and the situation are all of a great tension, which I love in
a movie. So one cop who is so vulnerable and emotional ends up being the one
person who you would most like to have save your life. Like Willis said in
an interview 
Die Hard 2 - Die Harder - it's bigger, badder and louder. I will leave you
with one question, the first Die Hard had approximately 20 people die, can
you count for me how many perish in this film? It is quite a turn
around!

Rating: 4/5 or 9/10

Bruce Willis takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin', nearly outdoing
himself in one of the great actioneers of our time. DIE HARD 2 has
everything a true action fan could ever want: explosions, chases, plot
twists, suspense, drama and all that other good stuff.

Just two years after his last near-death adventure, John McClane (what
a great action hero name) battles bad guys who take over an airport's
communication system around the holidays. Unless their demands are met,
they will unceremoniously plummet planes to the ground one by one --
including one on which Mrs. McClane (Bonnie Bedelia) is a passenger. Of
course Johnny, he of wise-cracking ways, is the only one who can save
the day.

Like its predecessor, set almost entirely in a skyscraper, DIE HARD 2
makes the most out of its setting. McClane is as multi-purpose as can
be, chasing mercenaries through luggage conveyors, grasping onto
aircraft wings, running out onto the runway and, in a truly awesome
scene, ejecting from a plane a split second before it bursts into
flames. Throw in a snowmobile chase, the standard trip through the air
ducts and a legitimate, interesting motivation for the crooks and you
have a total thrill ride guaranteed to recharge your batteries.

Efforts like DIE HARD 2 won't win any major awards, but they'll do what
films are supposed to do: thrust us into another world and entertain
us. This is truly Willis and director Renny Harlin at their best.

...but other than that, there's very little going against the second in the
series.  It helps (but not enough) that the character realizes he's basically
in a sequel.  There are some minor variations in the formula, but basically
the movie relies on the Bruce Willis' charisma and humor, and elaborate
action sequences.  William Sadler is okay, but no Alan Rickman (or Jeremy
Irons in #3).  It's still enjoyable, though.
<|_=00=_|>

I was expecting the worse 
when I saw this film, but this 
movie seemed to escape the 
curse of the cheesy sequel. Just 
as action packed and enthralling 
as the original, the wit displayed 
in this film saved it from being a 
mediocre follow-up. Bruce Willis 
was once again a great hero, 
showing how little being considered 
a hero means to him. A good film 
with a great plot twist, this is one 
of those action films which is just 
as good as the original.
<|_=00=_|>
Bruce Willis returns as John McClane who this time faces off against
mercenaries who have taken over an airport and are threatening to have
all the plane crashes, McClane's wife Holly(Bonnie Bedelia) is on one
such plane and so it's McClane back in action as he ponders how the
same thing can happen to the same guy twice. Die Hard 2 to tell you the
truth was a mixed bag. On one hand it had lots of action and a brutal
edge to the action but also lacks the suspense of the first. In either
case though Die Hard 2 is not bad as sequels go. Indeed even though
it's directed by Renny Harlin, Die Hard 2 works in-spite of itself. The
only flaw is that the movie is feels too much like a carbon copy of the
first film only with a bigger is better approach to the stunts. That
being said this is a minor flaw to behold and one really doesn't
understand the mixed reaction to this film, when the movie is overall
very entertaining.

I have no problems with the action in this movie. The acting is fine
and the characters are interesting. Add the plot twists and you have a
watchable entertaining movie that is worth your time.

What caused me to rate this film a couple of stars lower that I would
have otherwise is an idiotic part of the plot. Airliners are stacked up
over Dulles and the tower can't communicate with them. Their radio
engineer comes up with the idea of rigging the outer marker beacon to
transmit a voice communication to all of the aircraft apprising them of
the situation. Meanwhile the Army is being called by phone, TV news
crews are transmitting back to their stations and ground vehicles are
moving in and out of the airport. If one can communicate by phone, TV
link and ground, why not just get hold of the regional traffic center
to alert the airliners and divert them to other airports. Meanwhile
John McClane's wife is on board one of these planes and it has 90 min
of fuel on-board. Hmmm, 90 minutes at 500 mph. gives one lots of time
and distance to find some kind of alternate destination. But alas, that
would ruin the plot line of John trying to save his wife once more from
certain death. This hole in the plot is big enough to fly an Airbus
A380 through.
<|_=00=_|>

The 1988 action thriller DIE HARD was such a huge critical, commercial, and
artistic success that it was probably inevitable, given Hollywood's
mentality that there is never too much of a good thing, that a sequel would
follow.  The result, thus, is DIE HARD 2.

Bruce Willis returns as John McClane, who on this Christmas Eve is at Dulles
International Airport in Washington awaiting the arrival of his wife (Bonnie
Bedelia) from Los Angeles.  Flights, however, are being delayed all across
the board into D.C. by one of the biggest blizzards on record.  And when
Willis spots Army mercenaries in sensitive areas of the airport where nobody
is supposed to go, his cop instincts take hold.  As it turns out, these
mercenaries are led by a hard-nosed right-wing colonel (William Sadler)
whose aim is to snatch a known Latin-American drug dealer (Franco Nero) from
the hands of U.S. justice agents.  Their reason, as Sadler puts it, is
because he had "the guts to stand up against Communist aggression."  To
prove his point, Sadler and his minions shut the entire airport down,
putting all those planes in the snowbound skies over the nation's capital in
mortal peril, until Nero's military plane arrives.  The result is a battle
in more ways than one, as Willis must not only tangle with Sadler's gang,
but also with an incompetent airport cop (Dennis Franz) who thinks Willis is
a lunatic.

Very solid acting from Willis, as well as Fred Dalton Thompson and Art
Evans, who portray the two sympathetic airport officials, helps DIE HARD 2
remain leagues ahead of the majority of testosterone-laden action flicks. 
But many of the same flaws that were in DIE HARD 1 creep up here again.  To
paint the airport cops as incompetent buffoons just so that Willis can be
the hero of the piece is grossly inaccurate and offensive.  Even the media,
in the guise of the ultra-obnoxious Dick Thornberg (William Atherton), gets
slammed, and not in a very fair or accurate fashion.  And the violence and
language in DIE HARD 2 are far more pervasive than the original, with at
least two scenes (the icepick to the eye; and Sadler's ex-commander [John
Amos] getting sucked into the engine of the getaway 747 at the end)
approaching extreme in terms of bloodshed, and the use of the 'F' word
approaching SCARFACE in terms of occasions when it is used.

Still, there is plenty of suspense and tension to be had here, with the
direction of Renny Harlin evincing, at times, the feel of a Spielberg or
Peckinpah at their edge-of-the-seat best.  Michael Kamen's score, which
interpolates Jean Sibelius' "Finlandia" at the end, is also a
plus.

The verdict is that DIE HARD 2: DIE HARDER is not an unflawed film, but one
can certainly do much worse.

this is still a good movie,although it's not as good as the first
one.for one thing,it's a lot slower paced and there is less action.John
McClane is once again the only person who seems to be standing in the
way of terrorists carrying out there plan.this time,it just happens to
an airport which is the scene.Bruce Willis is back as McClane,of
course,and he actually has some more and funnier lines than in the
first.William Sadler plays the main bad guy in this one,and puts in a
great performance.i liked his character better than the main villain in
the first movie.the biggest problem with this movie,like i mentioned,is
the pacing.it is a bit slow especially compared to the first one.but
that makes a big difference in how enjoyable it is is.it's just not as
fun or thrilling.for me,Die Hard 2 is a 7/10
<|_=00=_|>
First reason why this is better than the original.. SNOW.. and lot's of
it,, the story is set in Christmas time, so you got to have snow,, love
the idea of the bad guys taking over a whole entire airport,, now that
is neat, i've been to Dulles more times than i care to remember,,
though i don't remember the Annex Skywalk.. so this movie just rocks on
all levels,, the bad guys,, and there are lot's of em,, are pretty
sneaky, and clever in this one,, Bonnie Bedalia returns as Bruce
Ex-wife, but as usual don't have to much to do in here, i loved the
fact that Dennis Franz was in this movie,, he is such an underrated
actor,, he is so funny, and i love every minute that i see him on the
big screen. Bruce has lots of funny moments in this one, he has to be
sort of like McGyver in this one,, trying to come up with different
ways to outwit the street smart terrorists, and o yeah there is a twist
in this movie,, but i can't ruin it ,, in good conscience.
