This is definitely one of those films that grabs a hold of
you
and does not seem to want to let go.Ron Howard's excellent
direction and Mel Gibson giving perhaps the performance of
his
career make this film worth seeing.Those of us who have
children,
although many of us may not have the courage to push the
limits
as Gibson's character did here,may appreciate this movie more
so
than those who do not.In fact,I might have been more reserved
and
cautious,even though I love my son just as much.This is a
definite
thrill ride from start to finish,and if you have a strong
enough
heart to handle it,then this film is definitely for you.

This movie was quite enjoyable. Mel Gibson is a corporate father whose son
is kidnapped for a ransom. Mel is an incredible actor - he has great
emotional skill, his dialogue never sounds corny or hokey, and Gary Sinise
is another fine actor with great skills. Together they make a movie
definitely worth watching.

A bit of a confusing movie but well worth it's money,Ransom does not
fail to deliver a couple of good performances from some good actors.Mel
Gibson stars as Tom Mullen,a businessman who runs a huge aircraft firm
who has his son kidnapped by a group of people.Rene Russo delivers a
good performance as Kate Mullen who is the mother of Sean Mullen who
was kidnapped and also the wife of Tom Mullen.Gary Sinise delivers a
fine performance as Detective Jimmy Shaker as well as Delroy Lindo as
FBI Agent Lonnie Hawkins.If this movie was dramatic,I was surprised
that Mel Gibson wasn't nominated for a lead actor Oscar but was
nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor-Drama.It is a shame for a
movie that is a good drama/thriller.

Buy it instead of renting it. This movie is like a drug:when you watch it,
you cannot stop. It is an intense thriller with an incredibly brilliant
performance from Mel Gibson. There are not too much bad guys but we got the
time to know them, and that is a good thing. There is lots of blood but no
free violence. No big guns, no macho commandos and anything bad. It is
simple but well written and well acted so the movie is a must-see! I give it
89%.

"Ransom" is no ordinary kidnapping thriller. It's a tense and
believable thrill ride where even the people who seem to be in control
are in fact not. And they know it.

Self-made airline tycoon Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) has it all: a
beautiful wife (Rene Russo), an intelligent young son (Brawley Nolte),
and a thriving business. That's all about to change when his son is
kidnapped. The FBI, led by Lonnie Hawkins (Delroy Lindo), is on the
case, but after a mishap, Tom loses confidence in their abilities to
get his son back. Tom decides to turn the tables on the kidnappers:
he's offering the 2 million dollar ransom as a bounty for the
kidnappers.

The best thing about "Ransom" is that no one knows who's in control.
Tom may be calling the shots, but he's very aware that this gamble
could end in disaster, something that neither his wife, Lonnie, nor the
kidnappers are happy about. However, it also could turn in his favor:
the kidnappers know that this is an opportunity to get the whole ransom
that they were going to split between them.

Mel Gibson is one of the biggest names in Hollywood, and for good
reason: not only is he very photogenic, he's an effective performer.
Mullen is a desperate man, but taking risks is what he does best.
Gibson is well-cast in the role. Rene Russo was the go-to female star
for mainstream movies, but her career has fallen recently. While she's
no Meryl Streep, she's a good actress. She doesn't have the juiciest
part, but she's no mere housewife, and Russo makes the most of it. I've
never been a fan of Delroy Lindo; his delivery seems pretty hammy in
his performances, and there's no reason why Lonnie couldn't have been
played by someone better. Gary Sinise is good, but too low-key.

Ron Howard started his career as a teenage actor, but now he's one of
the hottest directors in Hollywood. Howard knows how to make a movie.
"Ransom" is suspenseful and unpredictable. It's efficiently made and
involving. What more could one ask for? The only problem I have with
the film is the ending. It's not what happens (it's more or less
inevitable), but Howard obviously did it the way he did as a concession
to the studios: the last couple of minutes are so wildly improbable and
over the top it destroys the taut level of suspense that has been built
up.

Nevertheless, the majority of the film is well worth it.

6.6??????? Are we kidding here people...Mel Gibson comes off his Oscar
Winning film Braveheart to star in Ransom with an all star cast and
gets so little credit. It sickens me. Gary Sinise now ranks as one of
the most notorious villains after his role as Jimmy Shaker in Ransom,
one of the best performances I can remember in recent thriller history.
Gibson lights up the screen and is backed by Ron Howard's brilliance
and yet so few people appreciate his work. He has proved he can direct
(Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Splash) and Ransom only solidifies this
stance. Ransom will keep you on the edge of your seat for 2 hours,
culminating in a showdown between Gibson and Sinise that won't be soon
forgotten. Also, the lack of plot holes in the movie make it even more
believable, mostly because of the brilliance that is shown in its
simplicity, i.e., Gibson will go to any means possible to get his son
back, period. Check this movie out asap and do it justice by giving it
a higher rating than 6.6!

This is how it should be done, an exciting, exhilarating movie with great
acting and a terrific script which grabs a hold of you and never lets go.
Mel Gibson is fabulous (I'd almost forgotten he could act after all those
lame Lethal Weapon movies). Gary Sinise, Rene Russo, and Delroy Lindo are
equally superb. The viewer is always kept on the edge like you're a member of
the Mullen household waiting to see if Tom will ever see his son again. Five
stars *****

Ransom was one of the best tent pole movies released in late 1996. Ron
Howard and Mel Gibson made a film that grabs you and doesn't let go. Rene
Russo, Delroy Lindo and Lili Taylor are good in supporting roles and the
wonderful Gary Sinse is chilling. Someone needs to release this DVD as a
Critertion collection title.

This whole section is one big spoiler, so please only read if you want to or
already know the end.
The wild shootout at the bank was obviously forced on the director by the
studio heads, since it was so out of character and pacing. So typical of why
I dislike American movies.
If this were a French or British movie, it would have ended with the wounded
Jimmy collecting the reward and retiring in Florida. The audience would have
cheered his pluckiness.
If it had been a Russian film, Jimmy would have become mayor or governor and
taken out perfectly legal revenge against Tom.
Other filmmakers would have had Jimmy's girl turn on the hoods with
Jimmy.
If it had been a Japanese film, Tom would have hired private detectives,
eventually smoked Jimmy out and it would have been thrown out of court or
some such.
The class hatred angle was done so much better by Victor Hugo, I don't know
why they bothered. The ending we got was the dumbest possible.

Good action thriller that actually gets better as the movie progresses.Good
all around production and will satisfy most fans of this genre.Very good
performance by Gibson.Could have been better if it had an even higher
quality script.Not a typical average pop thriller.Has a good edge to it.Only
for fans of the genre and for big fans of the lead actors......
