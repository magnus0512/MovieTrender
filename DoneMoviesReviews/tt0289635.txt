A thoughtful, unapologetic and non judgmental character study of Joe,
one man, one distinctly unique yet common man. It is presented in the
context of a mystery, but this is no mystery thriller. Thrill seekers,
go elsewhere.

If you crave action, dialog, explanations and clear resolutions to a
plot, I suggest you avoid this film. If you are fascinated by human
complexity, admire beautifully crafted film-making, and can think and
observe for yourself, this may be a rewarding experience for you. If
you love and understand great acting you must see this film.

It is exquisitely filmed, in an understated and confident manner, using
hue and tint as artfully as any great painter. Joe lives in a drab and
uninspiring world, mostly of interiors; tight, constricted places,
where the inhabitants are caged too closely, too much ever present in
each other's spaces. When we are occasionally brought out into the
world at large, this tight confining world is often seen to be
surrounded by a distant, unreachable beauty. There are subtly beautiful
panoramas of the lush greenness of Scotland off in the distance, out of
reach of Joe, of all the people of his world.

The structure, the editing, the weaving of time present and time past
is without conceit. There is no "look at how cleverly I did that
transition" cutting. It is a perfect representation of editing unseen,
unnoticed, the mark of brilliant editing. Everything comes together,
simply and without explanation. Characters are presented simply,
without prelude. Events occur, without justification. You must think
and observe for yourself. If there are conclusions to be made, they
must be yours.

If for no other reason, see this film to experience Ewan McGregor: He
has been a reasonably attractive and adequate performer, in mostly
rather forgettable productions, until now. Here he suddenly emerges as
an actor of astounding depth and complexity, inhabiting, living,
revealing another soul. Without any reservation this is a great
performance. His subtlety, his inner directed creation of a complete
individual, is simply remarkable. It is a complete, compelling, always
true performance. You cannot look away from Joe. You must follow him,
know him. Do you know him? Can you ever really know him?

The plot, what little of it there is, unfolds through character and
behavior, with a minimum of dialog. There is much complete silence in
this film. The score is understated, never telegraphing what you are
supposed to feel or think. Indeed, I doubt that there is an answer to
any question here. Who is Joe? What is Joe? That is not the point.

Here is Joe. This is what he is, this is what he has done. What will he
do now? There is a quiet suspense, never quite gratified, which begins
with the very first frame,a corpse, gently floating, photographed
darkly, from below, so dark there is no face. A deceased, faceless
female human being.

Joe's is the first face we see. That first glimpse of his eyes, told me
that nothing would be what it seemed in this film. Joe sees something
we do not see. So begins the mystery.

Nothing is jarring, nothing is false. Life is simply never quite what
we think it is. Make no mistake. There is a real mystery here to be
revealed. Not a contrived, plot dependent series of revelations. It is
the unpeeling of the layers of a human being.

Much has been mentioned in this forum about the frequent sex scenes.
They are achingly non-erotic, distanced and cold, and ultimately only
functional. It is a passionless, desperate, mutually using and abusing
kind of sex. Only one scene has heat. And that scene is not really sex.
It is frustration, anger, vengeance, humiliation and desperation. This
scene is truly horrible, truly frightening and truly revelatory.

I haven't told you much about the plot. That is deliberate. The plot
works. It reveals the character. The progression of events is true,
often surprising, but never false, never contrived. If you need to be
told what is happening and why, this is not for you.

If you love great acting, by all involved, and appreciate the crafts
and arts of film construction, I highly recommend "Young Adam".

(I have one question for anyone out there who might have a feasible
answer: the title confounds me. There is no Adam. Nor is there any
reference to an Adam. I could draw no path to or from Genesis. So why
is this called "Young Adam"?)

<|_=00=_|>
What an emotionless portrayal of an emotionless man. Ewan yet again
proves that he is a force in both the Hollywood community and in the
independent forum. Not only for having the bravery to go against
American cliché and fight to keep his full frontal nudity in the film,
but also for having the gumption to take this role. This is not your
average character. Joe is not your normal 'hero'. In fact, I would go
so far as to say that he represents all of us. He is, sadly, our
'hero'. Joe (and Ewan portrays this perfectly) is constantly looking
for happiness and acceptance, but somehow cannot find it due to the
sexual urges that he has. It is interesting to see him want to have
emotion, but yet have no issues with sleeping with another man's wife.
This is a story of maturity for Joe, but sadly we do not ever see it.
When I was watching this film I was continually thinking of the film
Alfie (not the new release, but the older) in which a man embarks on
several relationships and ultimately ends up with nothing. That is very
similar to the story that we have here, only Young Adam is much
grittier and darker  and, well, more explicit.

So many times in cinema we watch two actors give heartbreaking
performances on screen, but just do not have the chemistry needed to
really pull together those intense sex scenes. That is not the case
here. The chemistry and raw emotion between Ewan and Tilda Swinton is
phenomenal. I have not seen a better match up in cinema in a long time.
This successfully added that extra intensity to their moments of glory.
I was able to feel and see their emotion and passion for each other on
the screen. It was exactly what this film needed to reach the next
level.

I know this story is based off a book, but I felt that director David
Mackenzie did a fantastic job of setting the mood and the scenes. He
amazingly built this sense of claustrophobia that surrounded Joe from
not only inside the boat, but also under the truck and in the second
apartment. There was even that feeling at the trial. This
claustrophobia is one of the reasons why Joe never stays in one place
for very long. While some will argue that he is nothing more than a
heartless womanizer and a coward, I saw him as a tragic spirit
searching for the lifelong happiness that he could never find. His
conscious was too heavy on him to ever find that perfect place.
Mackenzie allowed Ewan to find this character, and this powerful drama
was transformed well into the screen. 

Finally, I would like to add that Ewan would not have been worth seeing
in this film if it wasn't for the impressive Tilda Swinton who is
seemingly in everything lately and gives nothing less than 110%. I have
not seen anything that she has been in that was anything below good.
She is our next Oscar winner and one of those actresses that are not
afraid to get dirty. Her portrayal of Ella is no different. While
others would have simply just played the part, Swinton creates the part
and gives this film the backbone that it deserves. She nearly steals
every scene from Ewan, and that is impressive.

Overall, Young Adam is a deeply disturbing and depressing film that is
not for everyone, but will be enjoyed by those that are fans of this
genre. 

Grade: **** out of *****
<|_=00=_|>
The films focus on translating the novels first person perspective is
clearly an obsession for this director. Never is the audiences
attention allowed outside of Joe's point of view. We see only what he
sees, we hear nothing more and we remember his life in little snatches,
moments of dark disgusting and secret clarity he keeps from the world.

The film starts with a corpse, a barely dressed woman floating in the
Clyde that is fished out by Joe; a young man working the barges for
reasons that are not immediately clear. This brutal beginning in which
we see Joe lay a tender hand on the cold dead flesh of the girl begins
the film with a level of tension that rarely leaves the screen. Through
his actions and - more importantly - his inactions we peel away the
outer layers of a man on the run from himself, from responsibility and
from guilt. We see him commit two murders by mission of inaction and we
see him quietly dealing with that in one last lingering shot that tells
us he will never change.

Joe is sexually driven to destroy life around him and he uses sex as a
weapon against himself and against the possibility of settling or
creating a future. He could be a writer, but he lacks the courage to
read his own work. He could be a father, but he cannot face the thought
of commitment. He could be a lover, but he makes love to women only as
a means to an end, rejecting and pushing them away once the act is
completed.

And this is the film in a nutshell. A relentless character study of an
unpleasant man who punishes those around him for his own failings. Yes
there is gratuitous sex in this film, but it has its place, it defines
the moments of change in everyone else's lives while underlining the
static character of Joe, played with utter brilliance by Ewen McGregor.
The sex is cold, rather than erotic, reflecting the characters contempt
for those he uses. Without the detailed sex scenes the film would be
less than it is, but audiences expected to be titillated will come away
disappointed.

Not without flaws this film has that perplexing title and a scene in
which Joe beats his girlfriend after covering her with custard. The
scene is alien to both the film and the character of Joe who gives no
indication of being violent, rather a man that will walk out on a
problem rather than face the awful possibility of confrontation. In
fact Ewen McGregor seems embarrassed to play this scene, as though he
too cannot link this outburst to the character he is playing.

But this minor quibble apart the film remains an artistically shot
work, played with brilliance by everyone. Its rare to see a film where
the whole cast are brilliant, where the script is clearly cut and the
direction thought through. The visual aspect of the film is also
tremendous with each shot being laid out in front of us like a
painting, a wondrous work of art that moves and flows to show us the
60's post war Brittan with utter clarity.

Hollywood please take note.

`Young Adam,' the new film from David Mackenzie, begins with an image that
it is worth remembering throughout the film, and that a lot of people will
overlook.  We are shown a swan swimming along a canal from above, looking,
as swans do, elegant and calm, and then we see the swan from under the
water, its feet flapping furiously.  I was reminded of an early shot in
`Blue Velvet' where the camera moves through the grass to the bugs and
insects underneath  suggesting things are uglier than they appear - and one
at the start of `Lantana,' which moved through a plant that turns out to be
more complicated than it seemed.  In `Young Adam,' the image was similar:
the contrast between above and below the surface.  The image did not suggest
that one was more ugly than the other, or that one was more complicated;
just that they are different.

This brief but significant image is followed by one of a dead body floating
in the canal, which is fished out by Joe, a young worker on a barge in
Glasgow, and Les, his employer.  Les has a family consisting of a wife,
Ella, and their son, Jim.  Simple enough.  On the surface.
 
  
We learn quickly that, right under Les's nose, Joe and Ella are having an
affair.  The early sex scenes in the film  there are many  follow a
pattern; Joe approaches Ella, she says something suggesting she is not
interested, but her body itself offers no resistance.  She is bored with
Les, and gives in too easily to Joe (the concept of giving in to temptation
is perhaps the key to the film's name).
   

The film unfolds slowly, patiently, and in unexpected ways.  The body at the
start turns out to be of greater significance than we may have suspected. 
Joe does not restrict himself, sexually, to Ella.  He uses sex as a way to
add some colour to his otherwise pretty sad life, although he does not seem
to get any great deal of pleasure from it.  In flashback, we learn of Joe's
old girlfriend, Cathie, who did, it would seem, love him on a more than
physical level (we are not sure if he feels the same way about her, and he
probably isn't either).  They share scenes of affection and scenes of
bitterness, including one that I will only describe as almost ridiculously
kinky.  That's one of those scenes where I was left unsure how I was
supposed to feel; unsure whether the characters were enjoying themselves or
whether they were finding a way to express their rage.
   

In a film where the plot moves slowly and rarely hits anything big, the
attention and care of the audience depends on the script and the actors. 
The script is curious; the film's dialogue is often so dull that I could
only think that this is the way people talk in real life, not in the movies.
 That, though, is not a criticism, especially when you consider the
performances.  Joe is played by Ewan McGregor, and this may be his best
performance yet.  It's certainly his most subtle, so much so that some
audience members may be unimpressed by it, forgetting that it's sometimes
most difficult for an actor to reserve emotions and still be a three
dimensional character.  He certainly is an interesting character, who
surprised me constantly.  We learn that he reads a lot, he once tried
writing  and failed, using his writing time to make custard, leading to the
afore-mentioned kinky scene but I'll let you discover that for yourself 
and that he wants (or wanted) to go to China.
   

Tilda Swinton plays Ella as a typical wife of the time  the film is set in
the '50s  doing things that are perhaps not so typical, i.e. the
relationship with Joe.  Her habit of asking Joe if he wants some tea at
awkward times gives the film a very slight edge of humour.  Her husband,
Les, is played by Peter Mullan.  When he finds out about the affair, his
character acts true to himself, rather than to the conventions of scenes
about husbands finding out about their wives' affairs.
   

These characters do not express a great deal of emotion, and when they do,
it is unexpected, and makes us reconsider the characters once more (such as
a scene where Ella and Joe, rather cruelly, laugh together at the misfortune
of Les).  The film is also shot with patience and care, with a lot of scenes
in the dark, and a lot of shots using a haunting symmetry, as when the barge
is slowly consumed by a dark tunnel.  It is not ugly, nor flashy, but right
for the material.  `Young Adam' is a patient, thoughtful film, for patient,
thoughtful viewers.  Shots sometimes linger on characters for a while, and
some people may find themselves fidgeting, others trying to work out what is
going on in the characters' heads, below the surface.
   

The film ends somewhat abruptly, but it is perhaps the best climax the film
could have.  Alternatives would have Joe do a far, far better thing than he
has ever done, which would be unlikely and unrealistic; or a more neat,
happier ending.  I prefer this ending's ambiguity.  The whole film is
ambiguous, and so are the characters.  They are stuck in dull lives, not
heading anywhere, not moving.  And that is where we leave
them.

****1/2 (out of 5)
<|_=00=_|>

  One of the more quietly desperate films of recent past, Young Adam is an
interesting study of lower working class characters - working poor, perhaps
 set against an idyllic Scotland river life we have probably never seen. 
That working barges ply streams with bridges so narrow that crew must guide
the craft along by kicking the tunnel-like sides of passage and canals and
rivers are so pastorally picturesque is an awfully artful examination of a
simpler time.  

  Joe (Ewan McGregor), a hired hand laboring on a barge-of-all-trades is the
bad-boy promiscuous lover of any and all girls within contact.  Torrid sex
with any and all of them is his single-minded purpose, we gather at first. 
But we quickly find he 1.) is or was a writer  (failed or perhaps more
correctly never-started) 2) is linked to a body found in a river and 3) is
seemingly incapable of or devoid of emotion.  But we are going to alter some
our judgments of Joe as more is revealed.   

Sexual promiscuity confined to abrupt, even relentless encounters is the
main character's focus even though we know it is as unfeelingly given as it
seems to be received.  In one encounter, nearly violent in its depiction, we
cannot see the face of his partner as she cries (or is she laughing?). 
Interestingly lit, we marvel at this singularly stark depiction of
lust.
      
Ella (Tilda Swinton) and her husband Les (Peter Mullan) have employed Joe on
their barge and it is not long before we see how Joe has changed the dynamic
in the marriage.  It is with Les that Joe recovers the body of a woman
floating in the river.  Curiously Joe cannot manage the use of a boat hook
to snare the woman's body; Les has to take over.

The story becomes one of determining who the woman is and how she fits into
the story.  Through flashbacks we see a disturbing development as as the
police investigation of the dead woman ensues; we continue to follow this
thread through the course of the film. 

The music chosen for the film is unmemorable, but that may serve us well in
that it is never a distraction.  Time passes during the course of the story,
but it could be a week, perhaps six months.

An interesting film, the title has been bandied about for its Biblical
reference but reveals little about the matters at hand.  In the final
analysis the only surprise found in the movie is when a prominent figure
merely disappears; consistent with the tempo, it is a profoundly quiet
moment.  Disturbing at every turn, this is a film charged with raw sexuality
and should be seen to appreciate naturalistic film. 

<|_=00=_|>

Okay, this film isn't for everyone. A little dreary, a little bleak,
and the love scenes weren't always attractive, but something in the
dark simplicity got me.

McGregor is incredibly versatile, I didn't think once of the bohemian
poet Christian, or of Obi Wan... he's taken on an unlikeable character
with a slow moving plot and pulled it off beautifully. 

Tilda Swinton plays the antithesis of a Hollywood seductress, which
makes some of the love scenes uncomfortable, but refreshing. The
acting, as a whole, is the entire film. The action between characters
is subtle and intense, and although I may be biased as an Ewan fan, I
thought it was perfect for a dark, rainy night!

<|_=00=_|>
Spoiler warning !!

Although the audience may not realise it initially, this film is
carefully constructed with two story lines, one of which is through
flashbacks that blend so seamlessly with the 'present' that it feels
like it's running in parallel. As well, the director is in no hurry to
give the audience everything all at once. He lets the flashback story
seep through the screen in its good time. However, he does plant along
the way plenty of details that may seem a little strange but make
perfect sense as the story unfolds. The best example is at the very
beginning. Joe (Ewan McGregor) and his employer Les (Peter Mullan) fish
a woman's dead body form the Glasgow-Edinburgh canal which their barge
is working. In the same evening, when they are having supper in the
cabin with Les' wife Ella (Tilda Swinton) and little boy, Les asks Joe
if he thinks that it's murder. Joe breaks out into an almost poetic
description of what he thinks has happened, that the woman committed
suicide. This near-monologue is totally out of character with lowly
barge hand Joe, until two things are revealed later: Joe the writer (or
his aspiration to be one), and his relationship with the dead woman.

Not only the past, but even the present, is revealed ever so gradually.
As the sexual liaison between Joe and Ella develops, we are under the
impression that Ella is very much of an abused (though not physically
or violently) wife totally under the control of her husband. It isn't
until Les confronting Joe on the deck that we see an unexpected turn of
events, with Les' short, crisp announcement of 'It's her barge'.
Although Les has never been exactly a model husband, it turns out that
Ella is the real boss, in a very literal sense. We now see the tough
side of Ella. When Les packs his things and leaves, wondering when he
can see his son who is now at boarding school, we can't help but feel a
little sympathy for him.

The film is certainly not made to please the mainstream audience.
First, on the practical side, it does not care about political
correctness, and shows cigarette smoking scenes in abundance. The film
is shot with a general tone of depressing gloominess, with a few well
placed out-focused scenes, the most noticeable being the ending scene
with Joe walking away from the river. Yet, there is a melancholic
beauty in the sometimes grainy photography. At the very beginning, the
long-range shot of the dock and background scenery is so beautifully
framed that it can easily win a price at a photography contest. Equally
melancholic is the general use of the cello in background music. Sound
off is not used that much. In fact I only recall one, the sound of
buses and other street vehicles, cutting from Joe with Ella in bed at
the cabin of the barge to a flashback of a busy street scene of his
re-encounter with his ex-girlfriend Cathie (Emily Mortimer). The motif
of the hand mirror inscribed with loving words from Cathie to Joe is,
however, slightly over-used.

As to my summary line, all of the more subtle exchanges in the film are
made in silence, rather than with dialogue. The two best examples are
of course Joe's seduction of Ella and his first encounter with Cathy
(in that order in the film, but in reverse order chronologically).
There is of course dialogue but by the time it gets to the dialogue,
the parties have already established an understanding beyond words.

One reviewer makes an insightful comparison of Joe to Camus' Outsider.
Indeed, rather than being portrayed as an irresponsible libertine, Joe
is shown as a confused outsider, often driven by his own physical
desire, but not entirely without sensibility. This persona is echoed by
the title Young Adam, still young but post-Garden of Eden, tossed into
a cheerless world and doomed to an endless exile. 

The acting is first class all around. McGreagor shows that he is made
of sterner stuff than needed for a light-sabre-happy Obi-wan Kenobi or
a love-sick Christian. Swinton works the layers of Ella amazingly well,
first the passive, guilt-troubled wife (particularly at the second
liaison when Joe breaks the lamp) then the liberated woman temporarily
carried away with ideas of divorce and remarriage, and finally very
quickly coming down to earth again. More easily overlooked is Mullan
playing the cockolded husband, maybe not to the stupendous height of
the gentleman at Camelot, but with his own grass-root poignancy.
Mortimer's role may not be as demanding as the other three's, but her
competent portrayal of Cathie's endearing young charm is quite
necessary to make Joe's subsequent remorse convincing.

Young Adam is not for everybody, but definitely a marvellous cinematic
experience to those with the capacity to appreciate.
<|_=00=_|>
Young Adam is a powerful and atmospheric drama set on the canals
between Glasgow and Edinburgh during the 1950s.

Ewan McGregor is Joe, a drifter working on a barge, when he and his
boss find a body in the canal. As he begins an affair with the
bargeman's wife (Tilda Swinton), we find out more about his previous
relationship with the drowned woman (Emily Mortimer).

Adapted from the novel by Scottish Beat writer Alexander Trocchi, Young
Adam is, in some ways, a kitchen sink drama  a vivid picture of
working class life in its unpleasant reality. One of the best examples
of this type of film is Room at the Top (1959). But Young Adam has
existentialist overtones: Joe is alienated and passive, and not only do
his numerous sexual couplings offer him little pleasure, but in
rejecting the only thing that could redeem him, he condemns himself to
a meaningless life. This might sound too depressing, but screenwriter
and director David Mackenzie gives the film great depth and sensuality.
Very interesting. ****/***** stars.
<|_=00=_|>

Dark, bleak and brooding, Young Adam is a film charged with unexploded
tension throughout. Ewan McGregor and Tilda Swinton are superb in the lead
roles, conveying much in unspoken guilt as barge hand McGregor engages in an
ill-advised affair with his boss's wife. The body of a dead woman appearing
in the Clyde leads to a trail of unravelling that leaves a queasy feeling in
the stomach right to the very end of the film (and only then do we realise
the significance of the title).

Set in 1950s Glasgow this sombre recreation is a testament to Scottish art
house film making (even if they did have to go abroad for much of the
funding). The raw sexuality in the grittiest of surroundings is transformed
by aesthetic cinematography into explosive beauty as we explore the
innermost drives of the characters and work through their dilemmas with
them.
<|_=00=_|>
This film is based on the novel by Alexander Trocchi and those that
have read it may find more insight to certain scenes while others may
consider this a let down but my own personal view is that it's an
interesting film about cynical characters that still feel guilt about
their own actions. Story takes place in the early 1960's in Scotland
where we see three characters and a small boy living and working on a
river barge. Joe Taylor (Ewan McGregor) works for Les Gault (Peter
Mullan) who's married to Ella (Tilda Swinton) and they work and live on
their barge Atlantic Eve going back and forth from Edinburgh to
Glasgow. One day Joe and Les fish the body of a woman out of the river
and call the police who take her away but the authorities have a
difficult time figuring out who she is and how she ended up in the
river. 

*****SPOILER ALERT*****

Joe and Ella start an affair but it doesn't take long before Les finds
out and since the barge is owned by Ella it's Les who moves out but
while all this is going on the police have found out that the woman in
the river has been identified and was dating a married plummer who is
now on trial for murder. What everyone doesn't know is that Joe knows
the woman and her name is Cathie (Emily Mortimer) and he knows how she
died but he doesn't tell anyone the circumstances that could free the
man on trial.

Directed by David Mackenzie this intriguing little film is reminiscent
of the film noir efforts of the 1940's and 1950's although with all the
sex and nudity it's certainly one that is played for modern art house
audiences. The cast is exceptional and both McGregor and Swinton have
built their impressive careers by being able to play such diverse roles
and this is no exception. Mullan with his terrific face is one of those
great characters actors who never gives a bad performance and he
appears born to play a tough guy who works on a river barge. On the
surface the story for this film has it's characters behaving like cold
hearted cynics incapable of any type of sorrow or pity for others but
if you take a good look what this film really is about is unrelenting
guilt. Joe does feel guilt for his actions and Ella for her husband Les
and the three of them are compelled by the trial of the plummer. Even
though their guilt is stemmed for different reasons it seems to bring
them to the same place but the film shows that not everyone acts out on
their guilt for moral reasons. It's a hard story about tough skinned
characters who seem at odds about their morality and that's what makes
this film so intriguing.
