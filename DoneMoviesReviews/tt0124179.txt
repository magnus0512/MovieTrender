To say that this movie is shallow, or unrealistic, is to miss the point.
While it certainly has a lot to say about sex, and especially sexual
fidelity, the point of the film is not that at all, but that concerns of
sex
are not truly the most important factors in a relationship.  While
loyalty
and honesty certainly are, forgiveness is still a virtue, and lying about
sex is not the same as lying about feelings.  Though I, of course, do not
agree with what the female characters in this movie did, at least the
movie
makes the oft-overlooked point that sex isn't everything, a point seldom
made in movies, and often made in life.  Though it is certainly not an
exceptional movie, it is worth seeing, and an interesting look into the
privileged status sex has attained in our modern society.

I liked this, but I felt that it moved a bit slow, and there were a few
scenes that could have been cut/shortened.
I was impressed by Heather Graham, but Natasha Gregson Wagner left me sort
of empty.
Don't get me wrong, it's a decent film that I'd surely recommend, but in
the
same token it seems like something's missing. Like there's a better movie
trying to get out, but it's trapped by monologues and general dialogue
that
run way too long.

Toback's backbone of a script is great- it sets up the finest young actor
of
my generation (debatable- but worth saying) Downey Jr. is masterful in
adlibbing and improvising. He accomplishes what Brando failed to do in
Last
Tango in Paris. Downey is real. His problems, his inner angst, his
troubles
all surface. This is like being with him. His magic and charm are
entrancing
and enchanting.  Pretty cool. Worth a watch late at night- intense
though.

I watched it last night and thought it was brilliant.  Robert
Downey is just stunning, and the final scene of the movie
floored me.  I''m not sure how to use the word pathos 
properly but that final scene exudes it.  But before that the
whole movie is an excellent examination of an actor who
can't stop acting and the two girlfriends and mother he
loves. Very witty and exciting to watch.  I loved it.

Convict/thespian Robert Downey, Jr. tops his frenzied role in "Natural Born
Killers" with another manic Tasmanian Devil-style performance.  It's the
funniest of the year, an actor's nightmare (how far do you go when you can
do whatever you want?), but also the quintessential Downey, Jr.
persona.

Heather Graham is my baby, she just doesn't know it yet.  Just
kidding--truth be told, she excels in the part of one of Downey Jr.'s
girlfriends.  Wagner nearly matches her in the role of the
other.

Toback's direction is stagey (what else can you do with one set?), but his
writing is on fire.  Sometimes, you snag bits of the actor's riffs and laugh
at what you can get your hands on.  At other times, you sit back and let it
flow over you--this is high-speed Jack Kerouac, coupled with Whit Stillman's
keen ear for American bourgeois speech patterns.  Wagner and Graham test
each other on Downey Jr.'s lovemaking speeches, tying a noose for him before
he even arrives, later Downey Jr. verbally abuses and repairs himself in his
bathroom mirror--highlights of a dynamite script.

1998 was the year for actors and actresses, and many notables (and a few
unknowns) did landmark work:  Jim Carrey in "The Truman Show", Jane Horrocks
in "Little Voice", Warren Beatty in "Bulworth", John Travolta and Kathy
Bates in "Primary Colors", Roberto Benigni in "Life is Beautiful", Bill
Pullman in "Zero Effect", and Robert Downey Jr. in this one.  James Toback,
who also penned the wretched (and similarly themed) "The Pick-Up Artist" in
'87, is back on track.  With "Bugsy", "The Gambler" and this film on his
record, I eagerly anticipate his next picture.

i admit my love for this film is twofold--the setting (my City, Soho
loft vibe!) and of course Robert himself. he is sexy, period. he is
talented beyond what the public at large has realized. this was shown
in his fabulous singing in this film. who knew he could sing? and don't
start me on his acting--he is fantastic. this script is brilliant,
tantalizing, intelligent, refreshing yet also so real that it's kinda
eerie, but in a good way. so he's caught playing boytoy to 2 different
girls. the girls could hit him, be stupid, and ruin the film but
instead it gets heady, dare i say cerebral? and unlike most stuff out
now that feels it must include a "dyke" subplot to be "hip", it doesn't
"go there" but rather focuses on the dysfunction of this man and the 2
lovers he's been simultaneously f-ing. the staging is perfectly set--a
tight, confining setting of a loft. perfect. and the lighting is great,
a light you'll only find in Soho. just amazing. all the actors give
perfect performances. every nuance is right, every word is felt,
believed. it's simply divine.

Two Girls and a Guy consists of an extended conversation between three
people; a guy played by Robert Downy, Jr and two girls played by Natasha
Wagner and Heather Graham.  Both young ladies have been Downey's lover over
the past year, and through that time each believed they were his one and
only.  Unfortunately they both show up unannounced at his loft apartment to
'surprise' him and discover the charade.  The discovery occurs in the first
scene and what follows is a verbal confrontation between the three in which
they discuss love, sex, commitment, truth, yadda-yadda.

I'm not knocking it; the movie is really very good.  The three actors work
very well together in what is sometimes fine improvisation.  Definitely
worth the rental when you are in the mood for something different.

When I first saw Two Girls and A Guy, I thought to myself that something was
wrong.  The storyline impressed me, but the feeling that I got was that it
would flow much better in the theater.  The script through the whole movie
seemed much more like a play, and not a film at all.  After I noticed this,
I began to watch the movie as if it were on stage, and it made it so much
more meaningful, and the acting performances much stronger.  If Robert
Downey Jr. performed this role on stage, the audience would walk away with
something really special.  He is what makes the viewer forget that they are
watching a film.  He is outstanding in this role.    
<|_=00=_|>

I think all the performances were very good, although Downey's overshadows
his two fellow actors.  As I watched, I laughed a lot.  When it ended my
first impression was that it is a very clever lightweight comedy.  Since
then, the film has made me think fairly deeply, a rare effect indeed from
any film.

To date it poses two questions to me:  

1-can a man/woman love two people at once (or is s/he a simple
philanderer)?

2-is fidelity possible or desirable in the milieu of this
film?

A last question is whether self-destructiveness is inseparable from the
talent of actors like Downey and Robin Williams and others?

I have revised my first assessment of the film upward.
<|_=00=_|>

This movie, may have been the best to focus on the many talents of Robert
Downey Jr.  I'm not sure if the movie was a full script for this movie, or
if a lot of it was ad lib.  It all seemed so very natural. About 90% of the
movie takes place in the living room of RDJ's, character's NY loft.

I was never aware of RDJ's talent for singing, piano, and theatrical
performances.

There are a couple of graphic moments, but all in all, it's a GREAT movie.
Anyone who loves RDj, should most definately give this one a chance.  Even
though I hate Heather Graham, with a passion, I am able to watch this
movie,
over and over.
