What is it about an artist dying young - particularly if it is at his
or her own hands - that strikes such a deep chord in so many of us? Is
it the fact that this rare and special person achieves a kind of
mastery of fate at the last moment, a perfect conclusion to this messy
business of life that we mere mortals can never hope to attain? Could
it be that this early death is just one more instance of an artist
taking the elements of raw reality and transforming them into something
stylized, transcendent and meaningful for the rest of us to brood over
and contemplate? When poet and novelist Sylvia Plath committed suicide
in 1963, she became the archetype of the tortured artist - particularly
for sensitive young people who came to romanticize her end and her
suffering in ways that lifted her and her work to iconic status.

The biopic, entitled simply 'Sylvia,' gets the 'tortured' part pretty
much right, but has considerably less success with the 'artist.' 

The film focuses mainly on the tumultuous relationship between Plath
and her husband of eight years, famed poet Ted Hughes. The story begins
in 1956 with their love-at-first-sight meeting when they were both
students at Cambridge University. The film moves quickly through the
years, showing how, after a short period of relative marital bliss,
Ted's philandering began to take its toll on the relationship. As
portrayed in the movie, Sylvia, despite her notable talent, is a mass
of neuroses and insecurities, always toiling in the shadows of her
(initially at least) much more well known and commercially successful
husband. But her feelings of inadequacy and jealousy over Ted's
infidelities cannot, in and of themselves, entirely account for her
paranoia, her outbursts of anger and her suicidal tendencies. Those
resulted mainly from the clinical depression that tormented the woman
from the time of her father's death early in her childhood to her own
tragic end. The movie sidesteps the electroshock therapy Plath
underwent at various times in her life (though it very subtly hints at
them), yet the film still manages to convey just how great a victim she
was of this disease she could not overcome.

Thanks to John Brownlow's rather singlemindedly depressing screenplay,
there's a tremendous feeling of sadness hovering over the film.
Director Christine Jeffs brings a raw intensity to many of the
confrontation scenes involving the pain-wracked, benighted couple. As
Sylvia and Ted, Gwyneth Paltrow and Daniel Craig give rich, moving and
sensitive performances, and Michael Gambon leaves his mark as a
sympathetic neighbor who tries but does not succeed at saving Sylvia. 

If there is a flaw in 'Sylvia,' it is one common to films that attempt
to portray the lives of artists, particularly writers. Although a
scenarist can dramatize the details of an artist's life, it is
virtually impossible for him to capture the richness and power of the
art itself in the different medium of film. We never get the sense of
how Sylvia either overcomes the difficulties of her life to succeed in
her writing or how she uses those difficulties to enhance her art. What
we do get is a few shots of Sylvia sitting in front of a typewriter, a
comment or two about a book that has been or is soon to be published, a
few references to critical reviews, and a smattering of voice-over
recitations of Plath's poetry. What we don't get and what it is
virtually impossible for film to capture is the essence of the writing
itself. For this, one needs to return to the source material, the works
that have lived on after the woman herself all these years. If the
movie inspires new people to explore Sylvia Plath's writing, it will
not have been in vain
<|_=00=_|>

I am pretty familiar with Plath's story, and am also a keen fan of her work,
which i think contributed to my hesitancy in seeing the film.  I did not
have high hopes for this film at all, and honestly, I have to say that I was
pleasantly surprised.

My main criticisms:

I found it hard to get past the whole 'Oooh look it's Gwyneth Paltrow as
Sylvia Plath'.  Someone who isn't famous on a global scale would have been
more credible.

The whole premise of the film hinges on the deep passionate relationship of
Plath and Hughes, yet I never really felt convinced by it.  The relationship
came across as quite two dimensional, and even pretty one sided on the part
of Paltrow/Plath.  Instead of being portrayed as an emotionally fragile
woman driven to the edge by Hughes' constant philandering and ultimate
betrayal, Plath actually seemed to come across as being deeply insecure and
neurotic, constantly suffering from extreme PMT, and overreacting every time
she saw Hughes even talking to another woman, rather than having genuine
reason to suspect his infidelity.  

There were a couple of key dramatic moments (such as after they have made
love for the first time, and when they are out in the boat together) that
felt very hammy, so disrupted the momentum of the piece.

The score is just awful. Totally totally overwrought, over the top, too loud
and too much of it.  Plus, as Paltrow/Plath really starts to lose her mind
there is an almost constant sound of howling wind in the backgroud.  Again,
OTT.  Less definitely would have been more.

HOWEVER

Ok, I complained about Paltrow above, but she really did a great job.  She
really is a very talented actress, and it is a shame the whole celebrity
thing gets in the way.  She was particularly fine in the latter stages of
the film, and the sad descent into loneliness and irreversible depression
was very well judged.

Likewise, Daniel Craig was very enigmatic, although I wonder whether the one
sidedness of the relationship as mentioned above may have come from him. 

As a whole the film was very sympathetic, and showed how hard it must have
been for Hughes to live with Plath.  It doesn't justify his behaviour but
rather tries to show an understanding.  It also evokes a sense of a time
when poets were considered important.

This film stayed with me for some days after watching it, and I would
recommend it.  It is somewhat uneven in pace and direction, but I think
Christine Jeffs is a director with talent, although her inexperience showed.
 But above all, it renewed my interest in both Plath and
Hughes.

Film biographies of cultural figures - art, music, literature - differ from
those focused on great events and the men and women who either led others or
contributed to the hallmarks of history.  For a start, figures in the arts
have nowhere near the broad drawing power of, say, a General Patton whose
controversial larger than life war record is placed in a setting where there
are many other important figures, all engaged in very documented and
perennially debated actions.

In 1998, "Hilary and Jackie" explored alleged episodes in the short life of
cellist Jacqueline Du Pre and her pianist, now also conductor, husband,
Daniel Barenboim.  Despite very very good acting the film was largely a
descent into the basement of scurrilous storytelling by relatives of the
dead musician.  Whatever the truth of the claim that she bedded her sister's
husband, the movie said nothing about the couple's meteorically brilliant
early careers.  It was slanted voyeurism writ large.

Director Christine Wells has taken a very different and insightful tack in
exploring the life of poet Sylvia Plath and her marriage to Ted Hughes, a
poet with laurels garnered while Ms. Plath was still starting up a not very
steady ladder to recognition.

Plath, an American, met Hughes in England.  A short courtship was followed
by marriage and then  two children.  The relationship was tumultuous and
eventually it foundered because of Sylvia's underlying emotional instability
followed by her husband's desertion to another woman.

Sylvia had tried suicide at least once before meeting Hughes and she
succeeded in 1963, not that many years after they met.  Whatever fame she
achieved in her life has been eclipsed by what can only be described as a
cottage industry of people studying her relationship with Hughes, an
activity more important to some than her very fine poems and her most famous
book, a novel, "The Bell Jar."  In short, the real Sylvia Plath, whoever she
was, has been hijacked.

Wells takes a sympathetic view of Ted and Sylvia, not joining in the
political debate over feminism and Sylvia's supposed maltreatment by Ted. 
Sylvia in this film is brilliant but also terribly brittle and her inner
demons are not caused by a brutish or callous husband.  As Platrow portrays
her, I believe accurately, Sylvia was seriously and chronically depressed
with life events worsening but in no regard initiating a downward spiral. 
Today she would probably thrive and be both prolific as a poet and happy as
a person if successfully maintained on an effective anti-depressant.

Ted, played by Daniel Craig, is a bit transparent - loving but somewhat
distanced by his own quest for fame.  He hectors Sylvia to write more,
annoyed that she bakes instead of composing verse while on a seaside
vacation.  He's supportive but also blind to the deepening reality that he
is dealing with a woman who needs help, not critical comments about
non-productivity.

The supporting cast is fine but this is Paltrow and Craig's film.  She has a
strong affinity for England and its culture (I believe she has moved there)
and she gives the role deep conviction and understanding. It happens that
she somewhat resembles Sylvia but the true recognition is internal and
intellectual.  And emotional, let's not omit that.

Hughes essentially inherited his wife's estate and there's no question that
he, like Daniel Barenboim after Jacqueline Du Pre's death, received a mixed
blessing. He superintended the posthumous publication of "Ariel," one of
Sylvia's most enduring legacies. A man who only wanted to be a first-rate
poet, he became (and still is post mortem) the subject of arguments as to
his treatment of Sylvia and his responsibility for her taking her
life.

"Sylvia" sets the record straight as Paltrow acts the part of a woman -
mother as well as poet - who slowly loses control of her life while her
husband reacts first with confusion and later with the self-protective armor
of withdrawal.

Hughes went on to publish many fine poems and he became poet laureate of
England, a post he definitely wanted and enjoyed (Hughes was one of the very
few modern and relatively young intellectuals who was a convinced
monarchist).

Not long before succumbing to cancer, Hughes published "Birthday Letters,"
an attempt to show through years of verse the nature of his relationship
with Sylvia.  Whether viewed as an apologia or a last record - and chance -
to give his side, it's an impressive work.  And "Ariel's Gift" by Erica
Wagner is must reading for those who want more than a film and sometimes
potted articles can provide.  It analyzes the poets' relationship through
the prism of Hughes's writings, most unpublished before "Birthday Letters." 
A recent book, "Her Husband: Hughes and Plath, Portrait of a Marriage," by
Diane Middlebrook, is also recommended.

Incidentally, the film accurately shows Sylvia's suicide preparations which
included putting breakfast next to her little kids' beds before opening
their window wide and sealing their door so the gas she employed to dispatch
herself wouldn't harm them.  I've read articles where her adulators remark
on this as evidence of her loving and solicitous nature.  Rubbish.  The gas
supplied at that time would have blown the whole building sky high if
anyone, through ringing a doorbell or smoking a cigarette, had introduced a
spark into her flat.  Anyone surviving such a suicide attempt under those
facts would surely be prosecuted today.

The film score is very intrusive, signaling when important things are
happening.  The dialogue and Paltrow and Craig's faces do that very
well.

9/10.


<|_=00=_|>
When I rented this movie, I thought it would be about Sylvia's entire
life, or at least starting from her days at Smith College. I didn't
realize that her marriage with Ted Hughes would be the entire
storyline. I think this movie would've been better had they shown more
about Plath's life BEFORE Ted Hughes. For people who don't really know
much about Plath and her poetry, understanding her life before Hughes
would've made the film much more substantial. The audience has to
realize that Plath led a very, very hard mental life even before she
met Hughes, and her ideas for her poetry and 'The Bell Jar' mostly
originated from her bachelorette days. She never recovered from her
depression as a young woman and it branched out still as she married
Hughes. Without understanding Plath from the beginning hinders the
audience from understanding Plath at all. 

I feel like the movie only told half the story. Plath's mind was
beautiful, colorful, and brilliant. It wasn't just about the jealousy,
depression, and paranoia. Putting her works on the back burner really
took away most of this movie. I would've liked to see more narration by
Plath and giving us an insight into her mind, the way her unabridged
journals do. However, I really enjoyed the dialogue of this movie; the
lines were poetic and beautiful.

Unfortunately, I am still waiting for a better Sylvia Plath movie. I
recommend people to read 'The Bell Jar' and 'Ariel' before or after
seeing this movie though.

   ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***
After being forewarned by the teenager selling tickets to "Sylvia"--"I
hope
you like 'depressing', 'cause this is REALLY depressing" ("Oh, I do, I
do,"
I reassured him)--I spent the next 2 hours completely alone in the
theater,
which was somehow appropriate...

Paltrow was competent, Daniel Craig as Ted was appropriately brooding and
charismatic. That said, I found the film to be little more than a series
of
mainly gloomy vignettes rather than a more accurately energetic glimpse
into
her actual life.

From everything I've read about Plath (all of her works, plus over 10
critical and/or biographical books), the woman was a crackling force of
both
manic and depressive energy--this film, on the other hand, almost
completely
ignores the manic life (and death) force in favor of a pervasive
listlessness. Even the scenes that we know from Plath's journals happened
in
real-life are dulled-down here: Plath's bang-smash account of her
sexually-charged initial meeting with Hughes, for instance, which we know
resulted in tooth-marks on Hughes' face and his snatching her hair-band,
is
rendered as little more than a fairly polite dance and kiss in the
movie--you get little sense of the urgency and excitement of their
attraction. Another scene, rendered far more cinematically in Plath's
journals and in Hughes' poem "Chaucer", is her enchantment of the local
cows
with her recitation of The Wife of Bath's Tale---in reality, the cows
apparently gathered around her as she spoke, entranced by her voice, and
Ted
had to literally drive them away. When I read THEIR accounts, I could feel
the magic of the odd situation; in the movie, though, Plath speaks a few
lines to watching cows as she and Ted row past them on the river.
Ho-hum.

While the two lived in Boston, Plath not only taught at Smith, but later
entered weekly analysis, worked at a local mental hospital because Ted
wouldn't get a job, and hung out with fellow poets at Lowell's weekly
workshop, then got drunk with Anne Sexton, for one, afterwards. Again,
that's all pretty darn cinematic; but in the movie, the Boston life
consists
primarily of a few seconds of Plath droning on before a class or two, then
a
scene of women gathering around Hughes after a reading. Yes, they do have
a
fight after Sylvia asks Ted if he f***ed (the movie's word) one woman; but
her own written account of the scene was rather wild, with thrown glasses,
her "getting hit" and seeing stars, etc., rather than the bland
conversational incarnation of the incident that shows up here.

In London and Devon, too: In actuality, up 'til near the end, Plath was
constantly in motion: setting up households, sending their work out, going
to literary events, having babies, entertaining a myriad of friends and
family and neighbors. Dido Merwin and Olwyn Hughes have both left
testaments
to Sylvia's sometime-hostility on occasion; Plath's own friends have left
warmer accounts. Whatever the case, she was interacting with others, for
better and worse, and much more interestingly than in this movie, wherein
she mainly mopes around the house in a series of grim solitary poses.
(PLEASE, I feel like begging, show her getting mad at Olwyn for smoking,
or
angrily striding out onto the moors after an argument at Ted's family's
house, or yelling at Ted about the damn rabbit traps or his
Ouija-predicted
fame, or expressing her frustration at her mother's annoying visit.
ANYTHING
to portray an interesting, REAL person and to relieve the monotony of all
the pseudo-artsy posing that goes on in the film.)

In short, this movie sucks every bit of life out of Plath, portraying her
as
a zombie-like character almost from the get-go, when in fact we know from
reading her own words that there was actually a thinking, feeling, LIVING
person on the premises up until the very end.
<|_=00=_|>
Rather dull and uninspired biography, even though Gwyneth does a good
performance, she's unable to save a biography which probably will make
your own life look exciting - Sylvia Plath is portrayed as not much
more than a quite ordinary housewife that is cheated on over several
years. The affairs of her husband Ted takes its toll, of course, and
quite predictably drives her paranoia, but really; this is not film
material. Ted Hughes comes across as a lame, rather brutal husband with
little understanding of Sylvias troubled mind. Their story is told very
straightforward and linear, probably wrong since there is very little
story to begin with. A more adventurous structure, with glimpses of
childhood, early years, etc might have added much needed lyricism to
this lackluster project.

What makes poetry a special art form? Answers might include bringing
together extremes of joy and despair within a couple of lines, offering an
alternative to rational thought, enriching our outlook and understanding in
ways that prose would struggle to equal. Poetry can provide a single phrase
or sentence that is easily remembered and somehow unlocks
difficult-to-express inner states, just as a song can (and poetry is the
basis of songs). It offers a freedom of expression where you don't need to
explain every aspect of what you are saying - it urges the listener to grasp
a semi-spoken truth or idea.

That's my rough guess. I've got over 40 books of poetry on my bookshelf at
the last count, yet I'm no literary expert and appreciate poetry in a very
simple way. Most people might agree that poetry offers something special, so
a film celebrating the life of a famous poet might be expected to bring us a
glimmer of that something.

Sylvia Plath has been championed not only as a poet but as a sort of
feminist'  a cry on behalf of women treated as a commodity, subjugated by
an unfair male-dominated system. Cast in the lead role, Gwyneth Paltrow's
Plath focuses much attention on how downtrodden she was, chained to two
children, overshadowed by a brilliant and celebrated Ted Hughes, struggling
with bitterness, jealousy, mental instability and a less than attractive
persona. We also get the occasional poetic outburst, from
who-can-recite-poetry-fastest undergrad shenanigans to romanticised
performances of Chaucer (addressed to an audience of watching cows whilst
floating downstream in a boat). All punctuated with soft-focus shots of a
naked Plath/Paltrow, hysterical and often violent outbursts at Hughes, and
scenes of a generally uninteresting and uninspiring life of moderate
wretchedness. The only thing that distinguishes Sylvia from the
now-unfashionable kitchen sink drama is that its central character is called
Sylvia Plath.

So is the film worthy of the title? In A Beautiful Mind, we learnt of the
joy of mathematics, Lunzhin Defence championed the addictive mysteries of
chess, and Dead Poets Society made us lift our eyes to literary horizons
that could inspire the dullest of minds. Sylvia was limited, perhaps, by the
refusal of her daughter to allow much of Plath's poetry to be used in the
film but, for whatever reason, it has failed to be more than a rather
humdrum biopic. It offers little insight into her poetry or the magic of
poetry generally, and adds little of interest about the historical figure
that doesn't apply to millions of women. If any deep philosophical statement
can be drawn from this, the film certainly doesn't make it, poetically or
otherwise. Sadly, it would seem that the words of Sylvia Plath's daughter
almost became a self-fulfilling prophecy: "Now they want to make a film . .. They think I should give them my mother's words . . . To fill the mouth of
their monster . . . Their Sylvia Suicide Doll." Whilst not quite an empty
doll, Sylvia is maybe an arm or leg short of a manikin.

<|_=00=_|>

So intense ...
Ms. Paltrow does not let your eye leave her from the moment she enters
the
frame... moment by moment she projects her feelings thoughts...
almost painful to watch at times... you almost feel like you are watching
Paltrow herself unravel on screen (boat on the ocean.
I love Plath and I love Paltrow as Plath... she is heartbreaking and
haunting just like the poetry the real Sylvia wrote. She unlike most
actresses becomes a character and she became Sylvia Plath.
<|_=00=_|>

"Sylvia" is not quite just a slow, straightforward bio-pic of poet Sylvia
Plath.  While screenwriter John Brownlow has a long background in TV
documentaries, director Christine Jeffs has previously made a young woman's
mental disquiet dreamily visual in the superb New Zealand film "Rain."

She has her "Rain" cinematographer John Toon bathe the entire film in a
nostalgia-tinged amber glow, like the extended flashbacks to the young
lovers in the Australian film "Innocence."  I think the point is to
determinedly place Plath and her husband poet Ted Hughes into their specific
time at the cusp before "The Feminine Mystique" put a name to Plath's
frustrations and contradictions as a Fulbright scholar - experimental poet
turned wife and mother who ultimately turned on herself.  ("Mona Lisa's
Smile" with Julia Roberts will evidently be dealing with a parallel time and
place in a much more Hollywood interpretation.) 

As played alternatively languid and aggressive by Gwyneth Paltrow and a
Byronic Daniel Craig, they are an actively sensual couple, but notably not
Bohemian.  They are part of an intellectual but not counter-cultural set. 
While they are competing for editors' accolades and print space, she's
setting her hair, arranging her pearls and cleaning house, like a proper
Smith graduate of the time who is perfectly at home visiting her Boston
mother (played by real-life mom Blythe Danner) and amidst the books of her
late bee scholar father (My friend the PhD in English tells me that the
original film title of "The Bee-Keeper's Daughter" would have been fraught
with much more significance about Plath's obsessions.) 

Hughes celebrates his first big break by asking her to marry him and kids
follow one after the other; when they need money he looks to write a
children's series for the BBC. Yes, she gets more and more difficult and
paranoid, but he is having affairs (and another child) as he attracts more
fawning women acolytes.  

An earlier suicide effort is referenced a couple of times yet her
increasingly heightened mental imbalance as shown here could be post-partum
depressions or a Laingian response that insanity is the only rational
response to an insane, unfair world.  (The film does not seem to side with
her loyalist cult which Margaret Atwood satirizes in "The Blind Assassin").

It is always difficult to show a writer at work, but I would have liked to
hear more of her poetry than a few passing sentences. 

Gabriel Yared's music is lovely and unsentimental.
<|_=00=_|>
After viewing the film on Sylvia Plath, I felt a need to read about
this poet and find out exactly what Hollywood did with it. As usual,
Hollywood transformed a person's life into what an audience would want
to be amused by. Mr. Hughes is personified as a womanizer and
adulterer, the later of which may be true. After reading two
biographies of Ms. Plath by Linda W. Wagner-Martin and Anne Stevenson
and of course having studied Ms. Plath's poetry, I feel that the film,
albeit entertaining does not depict her actual identity. It does a
marginal account of her life, or part of her life. As any human being,
Ms. Plath suffered from many demons. If you ascribe to an astrological
standpoint (as Mr. and Mrs. Hughes did) you will find that Sylvia was
doomed by her astrological sign, Scorpio. Those of you who are Scorpios
know that there is a dark side to this sign. She set her expectations
too high of most things and considered the failure of loyalty from her
friends and family detrimental. Her experiences with depression only
added fuel to the flame. Had she lived in modern times, maybe the newer
therapies could have helped her. Depression is a severe affliction and
may make a great poet, but for everyday living it can render a person
helpless. It can make one helpless with dealing with marriage and
children, life in general, and one's occupation. Sylvia Plath was a
victim of her depression, her personality overreacting to life and her
relationships. Unfortunately, she could not work her way through her
inner problems and suffered the result of her mental blockage.
Fortunately, for her children, they were unharmed by her mental illness
and subsequent actions, and were eventually raised by their father. No
one is to blame... no one is superhuman. If standards are set too high
for anyone, as Sylvia set for herself, anyone is doomed to failure. We
do have her poetry and novel(s) to see her inner self, which no film
can properly depict.
