Leprechaun 2, aka 4 funerals and a wedding, the leprechaun is back and
he wants his bride for his 2000th birthday! I know it's silly, but I
love the Leprechaun series so much, it's just so enjoyable and fun to
watch. Especially if you love horror films as much as I do. Warwick
Davis also reprises his famous role as the leprechaun, which is a major
plus, since he's really the only one who can do it. You also notice
some other "little" stars in the bar sequence that Warwick has made
famous throughout the years. Yeah, the story is a little gross, but I
think that's why I loved it.

Leprechaun is back to reclaim his bride, she sneezes once, she sneezes
twice, she'll be his bride when she sneezes thrice! And he's gonna love
her... to death! In today's world, her name is Bridget and she has a
relationship with a cute young orphan, Cody, he is taken care of by his
alcoholic con artist uncle. When Cody and Bridget get into a fight,
Cody comes back to Bridget's house to apologize, little do they know
that a friend of their's has just been splattered by a lawn mower,
thanks to our friend, the leprechaun! He also makes Bridget sneeze
three times and takes her to his haunting layer, but Cody has a piece
of his gold! The leprechaun must have it back! 

Leprechaun 2 has much more great humor, like the scene where he and
Cody's uncle are drinking, and it was just so hilarious to see a
leprechaun drunk. "Drink all you want... drink all you can... you can't
beat me... 'cause I'm a lepre-can! Mmmph! Chaun!" LOL! I loved that
line, please, watch this movie if you are in the correct mood or enjoy
the series. Don't take it so seriously, otherwise, you're looking for
the wrong kind of movie.

I remember catching this film on UPN back in 2001, and it was
surprisingly more scary than the original. Don't get me wrong, the
original wasn't as scary or as a nightmare as this one; this time as
the trailers said, "He's Back!" This time Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) is
on the search for his bride after his latest 1000 birthday and wants to
breed more leprechauns. Like the first movie, he wants his gold after
it has been stolen or has been retrieved by the main hero of the film.
Most of the death scenes are more violent than the last film, but than,
again, its just a movie. On a lighter note, you get to see Clint Howard
as a tourist; Sandy Baron (Seinfeld) as the hero's partner; and Michael
McDonald (MadTV) as one of the Leprechaun's victims.
<|_=00=_|>

The Leprechaun is back only this time its a different one even though this
isn't really explained but it must be a different one because the film
starts 1000 years ago. It's the Leprechaun's 1000th birthday and as we all
know (of course we do) a Leprechaun gets to pick himself a bride every 1000
years (hmmm are they making up legends here?). So the little guy promises
his slave that he will set him free after he has his bride. Little does the
slave know the Leprechaun choice of bride is none other than his daughter.
All the Leprechaun needs to do is get her to sneeze three times, and he does
this. The slave then runs off gets killed and the Leprechaun says he ruined
his chance. Now I don't get this bit. He got her to sneeze three times so
why then wasn't she his wife? All the slave did was run away, how did that
stop him marrying his daughter? But anyway, we cut o 1000 years later and
low and behold that's today. It's the Leprechaun's birthday again and he has
his eyes on a new bride.
This films seems to completely disregard the first film as some of the rules
have completely changed. For instance in the first film it was a four leaved
clover that killed the little guy, in this one its iron. But in the first
film he came out of the safe in the shop just before he killed the guy with
a pogo stick. In this one they put him in a safe to try and kill him, what's
going on there? There are some really good scenes in this film that I liked
a lot. Seeing the Leprechaun getting drunk was great. All the little people
egging him on was superb. Some of the acting was terrible though. most
noticeably by the girl that played Bridget. The guys that played Cody and
Morty were OK and Morty was a great character, and of course Warwick was
great as the Leprechaun despite his constant terrible rhyming.
There was a bit more gore in this one but not really enough for the sort of
film it is. Low budget horrors like this need gore if you ask me. The
directing was ok with some strange shaky angles and the whole cave place
where the Leprechaun lived looked pretty good.
On the whole it probably wasn't as good as the first but was still an
enjoyable little B movie.

It's truly amazing how much life that this "Leprechaun" series has had.
It's endured for over 20 years; there's even a remake in the works.
Then again, I suppose there's something to be said for this kind of
dumb fun. And make no mistake, it *is* dumb. But it's also genuinely
funny at times, and is not without a clever moment or two. The makers
of these movies know that they're not making Shakespeare, and create
agreeable horror comedies that may have some viewers groaning, shaking
their heads, and struggling to get through them, and others having a
fine old time. Making a difference is star Warwick Davis (it is nice to
have seen him so gainfully employed), whose enthusiasm is hard to
resist. He's obviously enjoying himself.

In his second performance as the gleefully sadistic Leprechaun, he
attempts to snag himself a hot young wife. But his slave interferes
(the girl that the Leprechaun selects is his daughter), and 1,000 years
later the Leprechaun resurfaces to amorously pursue his slaves'
descendant, a girl named Bridget (sexy blonde Shevonne Durkin).
Naturally, Bridgets' boyfriend Cody (Charlie Heath) isn't going to sit
idly by and watch a demented fairy take his lady away. So Cody teams up
with his irrepressible drunken uncle Morty (veteran comedian Sandy
Baron) to do battle.

Baron is a real scene stealer, and in addition to the attractiveness of
co-star Durkin and the performance of Davis, does provide some
justification for sitting down to watch this. The movie does get
tiresome at times - and, for something running just under 85 minutes,
it does drag a little - but it's amusing often enough to make for
decent entertainment. At the very least, it does find the time to
feature cameo appearances by the legendary Clint Howard and Kimmy
Robertson of "The Last American Virgin" and 'Twin Peaks' as a pair of
tourists. Also showing up are Al White (one of the jive talking dudes
from "Airplane!"), Tony Cox ("Bad Santa"), and Billy Beck ("The Blob"
'88). Production design, lighting, and visual effects are good, but
there won't be enough gore for some tastes, especially considering the
fate of one character. The music by Jonathan Elias is actually damn
good.

This is about as enjoyable as any movie titled "Leprechaun 2" could be.

Five out of 10.

LEPRECHAUN 2, in my opinion, is a very clever and hip horror film
you'll love which will leave you feeling good. The only things about it
that scared me, like the first two, were some of the blood and gore and
when the leprechaun (Warwick Davis) suddenly appeared or jumped out
from somewhere. Other than that, I didn't get scared at all. Before I
wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did
an outstanding job. In conclusion, to all you horror film lovers that
have not seen this very clever and hip horror film you'll love which
will leave you feeling good, I highly recommend it! You're in for a
good time as well as some pure chills and thrills, so go to the video
store, rent it or buy it, turn down the lights, lock all your doors and
windows, and enjoy!

Why couldn't this movie pick up where "Leprechaun" left off?  I was confused
and disappointed to see this film start off with a completely different
leprechaun who just happens to look like the original.  Although this film
is flawed and not as imaginative and atmospheric as the first, it still
remains watchable.  It helms a slightly decent plot, has a few genuine
"jump" scenes, and features crisp, bright costumes and sets.  The problem
with the leprechaun series is that it takes the leprechaun to new and
uninteresting heights when it should try recapturing the atmosphere and fear
the original was able to deliver.
<|_=00=_|>
A leprechaun is revived on St Patrick Day by a hobo's bottle of liquor,
and then tries to claim the bride he promised he would marry 1000 years
ago. She is captured and held prisoner inside his tree-house home, with
her slacker boyfriend and con-artist uncle quickly coming to the
rescue. But can they outsmart this creature, who makes up in cunning
and sadism what he lacks in height and strength?

A sequel to an original notable only for an early appearance by
Jennifer Aniston, this is about on a par with its low-budget
predecessor. The lead lovers are so utterly lacking in anything
approaching acting ability or charisma you'll find yourself cheering on
Warwick Davis all the way. He, as the Leprechaun, is about the only
component that keeps the film going, and his witty one liners and nasty
methods of disposing of anyone who stands in his way are a constant
delight. It's just a shame that his restricted growth has firmly
pigeon-holed him into roles like this, he deserves more than to play
Ewoks and Dwarfs his entire career. Eventually though, even his talents
(including a fantastic Irish accent(!) ) cannot save a duff script, and
the end result is a entirely forgettable film which is only worth
watching as a last resort rental. And there's another four sequels to
go after this. Oh, joy.. 4/10

P.S Gets my award for most obvious body double ever used for a nude
scene. Watch it, and you'll see what I mean..

Leprechaun 2 is the sequel to the 1990 film with jennifer anniston of
friends...and is surprisingly good and watchable..who would think a film
with a lerpechaun killer would be good?Me...this film surprised me,the only
one of the leprechaun series with a plot when the lep needs a bride and
finds her but people get in his way which p***es him off and his gold is
missing...so now hes not stopping the blood and not starting to
leave!4/10
<|_=00=_|>
According to this sequel's magical lore, once a leprechaun has lived
for 1000 years, he can claim any woman as his bride simply by making
her sneeze three timesjust so long as no-one says 'bless you'
afterwards. When an evil leprechaun (Warwick Davis) fails in his
attempt to take a beautiful young woman for his wife, he vows he will
return in a thousand years to wed her descendant. Fast forward a
millennium, and sexy babe Bridget (Shevonne Durkin) gets the shock of
her life to find that she is the unlucky distant relative of the 'one
who got away'.

The first Leprechaun movie was a mediocre-at-best, tongue-in-cheek
horror made more bearable by the presence of a young and very tasty
Jennifer Aniston; having quickly moved onto bigger and better things,
Aniston unsurprisingly didn't return for this sequel, but thanks to
part 2 actually having something remotely resembling a plot, plus some
nastier-than-before violence and a fine replacement babe in the shapely
form of sexy Shevonne Durkin, it actually proves to be a tad more fun
than the original.

As Bridget's boyfriend Cody (Charlie Heath) desperately tries to find a
way to stop the diminutive troublemaker from wedding his woman, viewers
are treated to plenty of zany humour (Lep getting drunk is priceless),
a fair smattering of hokey gore, lots of dwarfs, and even a bit of
gratuitous female nudity (although Durkin's topless scene almost
certainly utilises a body double). It's all very daft, and not in the
slightest bit scary, but although Leprechaun 2 is no classic by any
stretch of the imagination, it's definitely a small step in the right
direction (which is the only kind of step a leprechaun could take, I
suppose).
