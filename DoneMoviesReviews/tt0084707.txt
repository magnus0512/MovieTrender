'Sophie's Choice' should be compulsory viewing for any member of the voting
panel who decide Academy Award winners. Quite simply, Meryl Streep's
performance is THE benchmark for that 'Best Actress' category. I've seen a
LOT of films, but not one performance has ever (and will ever) match her's.
The manner in which she embodies Sophie goes beyond explanation. It is too
accomplished and moving for words. It is almost offensive to think that
Julia Roberts was awarded the same statue for Â‘Erin Brockovich'!

Aside from the breathtaking central performance from the marvellous Ms
Streep, there are so many other reasons to see this film. Kevin Kline and
Peter MacNicol are excellent, the cinematography is beautiful (particularly
the shots of Brooklyn Bridge) the score is haunting ... I could go
on.

Although certain critics have berated 'Sophie's Choice' as a mere platform
for Meryl Streep as an actress, I urge you to overlook this view. The film
succeeds admirably in bringing to horrific life an event in history which
we
should all be made aware of. It is undeniable that the phenomenal
performance of MS leaves you spellbound, but NOT at the expense of being
horrified and affected by what you have seen. All I can say to sum up is:
just see it. An intelligent and profoundly moving film which will (I
promise
you) live on in your memory long after the closing credits.

Without a doubt, Meryl Streep delivers the Greatest Performance By An
Actress EVER - period.

The performance is totally naked, where you can almost feel her sorrow come
right out of the screen. For all of the heart wrenching scenes in this
movie, you never once feel as though Streep is going over-the-top. That says
alot for someone who spends just about half of the time in her scenes with a
tear in her eye. Everything about her performance just seems so effortless
and natural. This especially shows when she is speaking German flawlessly,
or English with a very convincing Polish accent.

The fact that Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol are not completely lost in this
movie says alot for their performances. Kline himself delivers a great
performance of a man suffering from delusions and bi-polar syndrome. It is
one of his greatest performances as well. Peter MacNicol plays the role of a
character who pales in comparison to the other characters. MacNicol has the
somewhat undesirable task of having to play the character who carries the
least amount of baggage. He therefore might be overlooked, when viewing at
the movie as a whole. However, MacNicol does a great job with the character,
not trying to make more out of it than it is supposed to be. His role is
very important to this movie.

But the real story here is Streep. Her performance would be a stand out
against any other performance in history. I honestly believe that. Streep
just digs down deep here - delivering lines that just put a chill down your
spine.

Meryl Streep's performance as Sophie is simply the finest performance
ever captured on film. Period. The subtlety and depth with which she
reveals Sophie's wounds are simply spellbinding. She is at once
radiantly beautiful, yet deeply wounded. She is charming, yet
vulnerable. She is someone you want to love, yet someone whose pain
keeps you at a distance.

This film takes the viewer on an intense emotional journey. Anyone, but
especially anyone who is a parent, would have to be an emotional rock
to not be absolutely haunted by this story. As much as I have studied
and pondered the Holocaust, this film has connected me to those events
more emotionally than I have ever been before.

This film, and Ms. Streep's performance, are a gift to humanity.

Wow! I am still in absolute shock from this film. Meryl Streep delivers a
magnificent performance, with a flawless Polish accent. Kevin Kline and
Peter Macnichol are terrific and together the three of them make a highly
enjoyable film. The 'choice' Sophie has to make is shattering, a beautifully
acted and unforgettable scene. 
Meryl Streep won the best actress Oscar for her portrayal of the nazi camp
survivor, this was richly deserved. The film was incredible with a great
score and many moving emotional scenes. The emotions of the characthers,
especially Sophie, are incredibly beliveable and bought to life. All 3 of
the main performances are haunting and memorable. A must see.

Highly reccomended. 10/10

This is still one of my favorite movies of all time ....and absolutely the
best acting by an actress in all the years since then. Streep is magnificent
and flawless.  The "choice" scene was so horrifying to me (a mother of a
young son and daughter at the time) that it took me several years before I
could watch the movie without skipping past that part.  It is such a small
scene, yet its impact was so haunting and so horrifying - I can't think of
any other scene in a movie that has affected me like that.  Kline was
terrific as well, and the musical score is beautiful and memorable.  All in
all, a wonderful film, and a perfect 10 from me.  What a gifted
actress!

...all of the characters in this astounding book/movie were as good or
as unimportant as viewers/readers found them to be, simply because
William Styron developed them that way: Stingo WAS an unexperienced
nerd, having lived an idyllic life in the South with nothing happening
in his life, yet aspired to write the Great American Novel; how perfect
for a virginous male to so fortunate to live with people who educate
him what a horrendous journey life can be. McNichols was perfect for
this role, because he was the opposite of Sophie. Nathan was mad and
KNEW he was mad, longing with all his soul to be otherwise; a little
madness drives people to do astounding things. Kline was perfect; what
a shame he has never found another role as good. Sophie was the haunted
lady whose life made her that way; Styron's development of her
character is masterful. I read an interview in which he was asked how
he felt his novel was presented in the film. His reply, "I took the
money and ran." He could foresee there would be controversy over his
work.

Some viewers, especially the younger ones, cannot appreciate how
actresses have developed over the life-time of movie-making. They
should watch some of the "silent" films to learn that mime was the only
way to express an emotion. Mellodrama, intentionally so - yet, look at
the entire work of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford as examples of
contrived performances. They were, at last, able to confront one
another in "Baby Jane" - attempting to "out-drama" one another made it
the wonderful film it is.

There is simply no other actress, that we know of, who is more talented
a performer than Streep. Unlike Davis and Crawford, she is not
concerned about her "star-power". She becomes whatever character she is
playing, no matter if we like them or not. SO WHAT if "Sophie's Choice"
was a vehicle to demonstrate her power? Please write another !! William
Styron, stand forth ! Because of her absorption into her characters and
the many nuances she developed in "Choice", take a look at "The Deer
Hunter" to see how powerfully she played an un-extraordinarily plain
woman perfectly. Under-playing a character, to make you believe people
are actually like that, is the mark of a great actress.

I ardently pray there will be another role for Ms. Streep - even in her
older years - that will allow us to become totally engrossed, to get
outside of our own lives, to become completely destroyed, delirious,
shattered just for a couple of hours, to realize there is still such
talent in the world - THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO WATCH, at least.....thank
heavens for this magical film.....

If the Oscars were to take every Best Actress winner ever -- from Janet
Gaynor to Helen Hunt -- Meryl Streep would definitely have a good shot at
winning against them. She gives a spellbinding, totally believable
performance as Sophie, a timid Polish woman who befriends Stingo (Peter
MacNicol), while she tells him of her tortured past in a concentration camp.
As always, she does her foreign accent without fault, and puts her all in
her performance, better than she's ever done. The movie itself is very good,
too -- it may drag at times (at 2 1/2 hours), but definitely worth a
look.

After enjoying Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline in the recent ensemble
comedy "A Prairie Home Companion," it was great to see their dramatic
performances in "Sophie's Choice," the movie that made them famous.
Here, they play Sophie and Nathan, a volatile young couple living in a
Brooklyn boardinghouse in the summer of 1947. Their story, and
eventually the story of the Polish Sophie's time in a concentration
camp during World War II, is presented through the eyes of Stingo
(Peter MacNichol), their young Southern neighbor.

Though other characters appear, especially during the flashbacks,
"Sophie's Choice" is largely a three-person drama that relies on subtle
interactions. Meryl Streep can always be counted on to give a nuanced
performance, but here, especially, she raises the bar. Speaking three
languages (including a very realistic portrayal of how foreigners can
hesitate and hunt for words when speaking English), going from a
haggard Auschwitz inmate to a pretty "blooming rose," consumed by guilt
even during the madcap or romantic moments she shares with Nathan, she
gives a brilliant performance of a very complex character. Her big
scenes with Nazi officers are of course powerful, but I was equally
struck by smaller moments: the heartbreaking little flashes of emotion
that reveal Sophie's postwar wounds, or the extraordinary conversation
she has with a Nazi's daughter.

Kline throws himself into the role of the "fatally glamorous" Nathan
and also displays impressive range: he goes from charming to menacing.
MacNichol is not up to these (admittedly high) standards. He can play
the wide-eyed innocent, but he always seems somewhat thick-headed and
lacking in passion. The movie would be more effective if Stingo seemed
more truly changed by his experiences with Sophie and Nathan.

Despite Stingo's weakness as a character, I liked the unusual structure
that reveals Sophie's story gradually, in flashbacks that draw closer
and closer to the ultimate horror. The movie is nicely shot and some of
the Brooklyn scenes look as though they actually could have come from a
1940s movie. But no director from the 1940s would have confronted the
brutalities of the Holocaust so directly, and few actresses from any
era could have given a performance like Streep's.
<|_=00=_|>
Although achingly literary at times, moments of true emotional power
are rendered by fluid storytelling, Nestor Almendros's haunting
cinematography, Marvin Hamlisch's quietly effecting score, a touching
performance by Peter MacNichol, and a seminal performance by Meryl
Streep; one that Kim Stanley (the celebrated actress/teacher and Oscar
nominated mother to Jessica Lange in 'Frances' of the same year)
proclaimed, "the titanic portrayal of her generation."

No matter what your initial feelings about this film, I encourage you
to go back and take in Streep's dark dance of loss, madness and,
finally, sorrowful redemption.

Arguably Meryl Streep's most compelling performance...and lord knows
the woman has turned in a few during her career! I found myself
delighted, beguiled, enchanted, crushed and ultimately reduced to a
drained and empty shell by the film's end; it took several days
thereafter to fully recover. Her vulnerability and honesty are as
inescapable as her demons. And you cannot help but be drawn into such a
real sense of both conflict & compassion, duty and despair...this film
completely melted my face off while cementing an admiration and awe I
rarely experience from an actor's performance. All due respect to both
Kline & MacNichol for their fine portrayals, but really the movie
begins and ends with Streep's haunting, brilliant and enormously human
turn as Sophie! This is a "must see" film albeit a gut wrenching
experience!!! Totally amazing!!!
