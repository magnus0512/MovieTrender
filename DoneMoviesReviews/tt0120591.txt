This movie is my ultimate guilty pleasure. It's inane, manipulative,
has hyperactive cutting, a ton of glaring inaccuracies (pointless to
even discuss or debate), and probably 29 other glaring faults. And why
in every dramatic slow-mo emo shot are there 3 helicopters flying in
unison overhead? What's the point of having 3 helicopters flying really
close together? Who cares! It looks cool. If one day I am having a
heartfelt talk with my daughter, I hope there are 3 helicopters flying
overhead to really 'bring it home' (and Aerosmith performing in the
background.)

Despite it all, I still love watching this movie. Anytime it is on TV I
can watch it 'til the end. Bruce Willis does a great job doing his
Bruce Willis 'thing' (smart alecky tough guy), and the supporting cast
is really great. Steve Buschemi in particular gets the best lines. An
awesome assortment of ragtag castoffs (spitting funny one-liners) must
save the world- who would have thunk it?

I think Armageddon was actually conceived by suits in a studio office
(no really, I read that in a magazine), which is I guess another strike
against it. Yet only a bunch of suits could come up with a 'high
concept' like this (so high it's basically a parody by itself.) And
only a director like Michael Bay could make it. He's far more suited to
these types of movies, rather than big historical epics like PEARL
HARBOR (which I really, really disliked.)

I read somewhere once that this movie is as close as Hollywood gets to
pure cinema, in that it is basically completely divorced from reality
of any kind. Is that good or bad? I don't know. I do think if you're
going to ditch convention and any semblance to reality, you may as well
go all the way. It's better than having something that is a confused
mess that tries to be different things (Pearl Harbor.) There will be no
'it could really happen!' here.

So after all this, believe it or not I am going to give this movie a
big fat whopping 8. Why? Because IMO it unabashedly succeeds at what it
tries to set out to be, whatever that is. That makes no sense, since I
am basically saying by all logical accounts this movie may actually
suck, yet I am giving it a 8. But hey I loved this movie.

This movie seems to be a movie that many people love to hate.  I don't see
why it has such a bad reputation.  It is meant to be an
Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie, and it definitely lives up to this.  It is
what it is. Many people have tried to compare it to Apollo 13, but that's
like comparing apples and oranges.  They are entirely different fruit.
Apollo 13 is based on a true historical event (Docu-drama), while
Armageddon
is an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie.  It has plenty of action and
adventure,
a lot of humor, and a bit of romance.  Is the story realistic? Not hardly,
but name ANY Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie that is.  That's why they call
it
Science FICTION...
For those who criticize this movie, nothing will change their minds.
However, if you HAVEN'T seen Armageddon, take a chance, watch with an open
mind and try not to let all these negative reviews spoil your enjoyment of
a
really fun movie.  Remember, a movie is meant to ENTERTAIN, and Armageddon
does just that, if you let it!

What did everyone expect when this film was released, i expected
exactly what i got, stunning visual effects, good surround sound and
plenty of action (and yes i expected the traditional dose of sentiment
too)

This movie is pure escapism fun, which has its place in my collection,
movies like Independence Day and Armageddon are great fun to watch and
as a bonus the characters weren't bad the script was reasonable and
action was indeed plentiful. There were a great deal of laughs too
(mostly intentional) anyone who hasn't seen this but just wants relax
and enjoy a good (yet Shallow) action flick then this certainly fits
the bill.

For pure entertainment value i score it 8/10

If this is for you then check out The Core and Independence Day, avoid
the Day after Tomorrow and Deep Impact, there not really for action
fans.

People always seem to be flaming this movie left and right because it's
stupid or long or it has no logic... Everyone has something to hate
about this film but the movie wasn't intending to be 'Gone With The
Wind'. This is the essential Friday night movie.

Not Saturday Night but Friday Night. Sure, a lot of it is illogical and
Michael Bay graduated in the MTV style of directing college but, at
it's heart, it's just a great entertaining popcorn movie. Even Bay has
admitted that was what he was aiming at. And for a popcorn movie, it's
a very strong movie indeed. The acting is impressive with Bruce Willis
making you cry for real in that last scene of his where he proves to be
the ultimate superhero and he doesn't even have to say "yippee ki-yay".
Ben Affleck is doing his nice hammy acting in this film but he gives a
really genuine performance in a lot of the scenes. Liv Tyler is
stunning and excellent as Bruce Willis' daughter and Ben Affleck's
fiancee. Billy Bob Thorton has a nice little role at the NASA
headquarters. Steve Buscemi is the best part of the film. Funny yet
still a great actor, this is one of his best performances. Michael
Clarke Duncan is light in his role as one of the astronauts / oil
driller and Owen Wilson lights up the screen just like in 'The Royal
Tenenbaums'. That's only some of the cast that I'm going to list and
those are the most recognizable names in the list. The script by 'Die
Hard With A Vengeance' scribe Jonathan Hensleigh and 'Roadkill" and
upcoming 'Superman' writer J.J.

Abrahams is fun and enjoyable with some real quirky dialogue and real
funny bits. There are also some genuine moments of suspense and drama.
The look of this film is obviously special effects orientated with the
New York asteroid shower opening sequence and the destruction of Paris
standing out. Of course, this film is just an enjoyable popcorn film
and is actually deserving of it's place in "The Criterion Collection"
of DVDs since it's that enjoyable kind of film that only comes along
once in a while. But add to that the fact that there are some real sad
moments and great acting in there and, there you have it, the perfect
ingredients for a Friday night movie.
<|_=00=_|>
...that's exactly what this is: an ACTION movie.  It's not supposed to sweep
the Oscars, the acting isn't supposed to be perfect, and it's not supposed
to make perfect sense.

The story follows a group of oil drillers sent by NASA to stop an asteroid
that will strike the world in eighteen days.  The drillers are taught and
trained to become astronauts (in a very comedic scene) and then sent to the
asteroid to drop the nukes and blow it up.  After that, a whole lot goes
wrong.

I loved this movie, and I hate how everyone's been calling it 'mindless
action'.  It's not mindless, it's actually very dramatic.  The acting is
great from pretty much all accounts, even Ben Affleck does a good
job.

Bruce Willis captures the 'reluctant hero' role, and Liv Tyler does well as
his daughter.  Steve Buscemi delivers a great comedic performance as the
genius who goes insane once they land on the asteroid.

Great, funny, intense, dramatic movie.  8/10.

I saw this film last night.

And I'm worried I'm turning into one of those left-wing liberals they
rightly make fun of in South Park. Because I found it hugely offensive.
Am I being ridiculously sensitive? Firstly, there's the old staple that
is America being the only country in the world that is physically
capable of anything, ever.

Secondly, and chillingly, there is the early meteor strike hitting some
(unnamed Â– why do they need a name?) Asian country. The reaction to
this is to look at it as a warning. As in "my god, imagine the tragedy
that *could* happen". Because, you know, it happened to Asians. It
might happen to white Americans, and *that* would be tragic.

Then, later on, a bigger meteor hits Paris. Our cast on the ground are
irritated, because this might mean our boys have less time than they
thought. Not much upset in America. No mention that a lot of people
have died.

Then there's Michael Clarke Duncan. A wonderful actor, wasted. Never
has a black man been so token. Among a team of hardcore drillers, his
job seems to consist of standing in the back, occasionally saying "Hey,
you da man." Really. Why did they even bring him? It's not like he's
petite - he weighed down that shuttle for nothing! Not once does he
lift a tool, steer a space ship or even help fix anything that blows
up.

Even if you ignore the Russian Cosmonaut (Peter Stormare, another great
actor wasted in a pointless role), who seems drunk most of the time and
hits things with spanners instead of fixing them because "Dat's how we
do dese dings in Russia", it's pretty horrific.

All cemented of course by the site of blond, blue-eyed American
children all celebrating in corn fields at being saved and everything
being all right. Because all the death and destruction to the rest of
the world is irrelevant.

You expect the bad script, the dodgy acting, the implausible plot (fat,
middle aged men being trained in 12 days to be astronauts? Including
one who appears to be retarded?). But I couldn't believe the racism and
xenophobia implied in the film, and the callous disregard for the lives
of anyone not corn-fed American.

It's a chilling indictment of the attitude of a section of Western
Society to the world.

And it's a crappy film too.

this movie is arguably one of the best movies i have ever seen and to
be honest i can NOT understand its current IMDb rating... it has
everything in needs to be a movie worth remembering after tens of
years! it can put a large smile on your face in its funny moments, and
it WILL bring tears in your eyes in its most emotional moments... this
movie is a reminder of why human life is worth cherishing, worth
fighting for, worth DYING for... it features great human valors such as
love, forgiveness, heroism, sacrifice, sturdiness.. i must have seen it
at least 8 times by now and it never, NEVER ceases to impress me to the
point of tears.. to conclude with, i am very disappointed in the
viewers that voted on this movie here.. honestly it deserves 10/10
<|_=00=_|>
This could have been super but, as with the case of most modern action
films, the action is way overdone. Still, it had its moments.....

THE BAD -One word describes a lot of scenes in here: chaos. Things are
blown up all over the place, people are shouting everywhere. It gets to
be too much, especially in the last hour which gets ludicrous. You
practically have a headache when you're finished watching the 150
minutes of mayhem.

Half of the disasters that happen to the astronauts were not needed,
and many of them come one after the other. It wound up muddling the
story. Do today's filmmakers think you have to have something dramatic
and loud every two minutes to keep their audiences? And talk about
loud.....holy eardrums, Bataman, you could be deaf listening to this
movie which includes a lot of loud heavy-metal "music." It's too noisy.

There are touches of "Independence Day" mentality with very unrealistic
with a veteran astronaut smuggling a gun on board a ship; the daughter
of the one of the astronauts barging into the command center and
shoving the center's leader in the middle of a crisis (in reality, she
wouldn't be allowed in the room to begin with); and the usual
last-second impossible heroics. I mean, sometimes I swear I was
watching a movie made specifically for morons. Speaking of stupid, what
was that goofy cosmonaut character (Peter Stormare) all about. That's
just another example of what I was just talking about - totally
unrealistic people. Why does Hollywood like to portray astronauts -
some of the classiest, most educated and reserved people in the world -
in such a negative light? Just another of its sicknesses, I guess where
good is bad and bad is good.

THE GOOD - What was great to watch in this film were the
special-effects, especially the disaster scenes with the meteors
hitting the earth. They were spectacular. A few of the panoramic scenes
in here were beautiful, too. (This is a must for widescreen DVD.)

There is a good mix of humor in this adventure thriller. That humor
makes some of the characters likable, even though they are still
unrealistically sleazy heroes. Steve Buscemi had most of the good
comedic lines. I liked Billy Bob Thornton as the NASA boss. He's very
interesting to watch. Bruce Willis plays his normal macho-hero role.
His heroic effort in the end is nicely sentimental. The
special-effects, as mentioned earlier, were perhaps the best right in
the first 5-10 minutes of the film - a real attention-grabber right off
the bat. Actually, the first half of this film is far better than the
second half.
<|_=00=_|>
I'll be the first to tell you, special FX are not what I look for when
I am hitting the movies, I love intelligence and acting, story, story,
story, good directing at least. But from the opening scenes,
'ARMAGEDDON' explodes into emergency action. This sci-fi comedy-drama
was a solid hit!! I have to fully disagree with critics who will praise
a horrible movie and then say that a story like this is not bigger than
life. This is a blockbuster entertainment giant, with a striking sense
of humor, which 'Rockhound' (Bucsemi) provided many laughs, along with
the rest of the multi-talented and troubled 'troup' of civilized
maniacs. I truly think that the plot of the story is fun to think
about, the world needs to be saved by a bunch of motley-ruff necks that
can hardly obey the regular laws in their own city and now, they are
going to work with the laws of gravity, science and all else to keep
the planet from becoming a memory. Every movie mogul wants a block
buster that is going to in essence save the world from total oblation
and hit the box office with a vengeance. This one does it with he-man
style and a wise-crack or two. They all ride together though, Harry
Stamper, Grace the young in love daughter of Harry, Charles Chapple er,
I mean 'Chick', A.J. also in love with Grace much to Harry's
uneasiness, 'Rockhound' who just wants to have girls' who 'just want to
have fun' the man who is a sky-scraper if anything else, Jayotis 'Bear'
who is strong and a bit on the sensitive side, just to give us
equilibrium, when they landed on the surface of the huge rock and he
looks up and emotional and exclaims Thank you Jesus! The theater
roared! He was right though. Then there is 'Oscar' who is a fun having
not so fearless worker, and the comically sarcastic, but easy going
Max, all under N.A.S.A Administrator Dan Truman who can't fly anymore.
But he gets to watch these birds-of-a-feather, working together. With
everyone up and going plus Lev Andropov the Russian Cosmonaut who works
hard and gets a little too rowdy! They are able even with the adversity
of Col. William Sharp they come together and pull it off and even with
the last few moments when Harry Gives his life for A.J. in a very
touching moment the story comes together and sets it right, the screw
balls have a mature moment and a sobering lesson. But this crew is
great!! They all mix together like a great drink. Bruce has the Juice,
along with the rest of the motley crew, making this adventure a blast,
even by today's standards it still comes across with strength, style,
and comedic punch! 

Recommended for action/adventure sci-fi junkies as well as regular
Joe's' like me. (****)

This movie is one of the silliest, dumbest movies I have ever seen.  When
I
saw this film, it was apparent that no thought, no research, no
intelligence
went into the writing at all.

Let's start with the basic premise of the film.  An asteroid is discovered
and we have 17 days until it hits.  What do we do?  In the real world, we
bend over and kiss our butt goodbye.  There is absolutely *no* way a
mission
such as this could be planned, trained-for and executed in this time.  17
days wouldn't be enough time to prepare a standard shuttle launch, much
less
one with this type of mission.  This movie blindly ignores this
fact.

I am always distressed when films treat people as mere cattle, props to
use
while pounding a point home and then forget.  In the open of the movie,
New
York is hit with a barrage of fragments, presumably causing untold death
and
injury.  In the real world, people might even see fit to comment upon this
with the people they meet.  In Armageddon, this scene is presented as
eye-candy (it *does* look pretty good) and then is promptly forgotten by
everyone involved.  No one talks about it.  No one cares.

There is so much that is wrong with Armageddon.  The science involved in
splitting an Asteroid the "size of Texas" with a nuclear bomb implanted
only
800 feet into surface (trust me, when you have driven 800 feet into Texas,
you haven't driven very far.)  The idea that that bomb could divert the
two
large fragments enough to cause them to miss the Earth in the time they
had
left.  The amazing "gravity" on the asteroid.

The thing is, I can enjoy a good fantasy movie.  Films do not always have
to
work by the rules of the reality I live in.  I can accept "The Force" and
other such fanciful ideas, as long as the movie is true to its own
reality.
But Armageddon chose to place itself in *our* reality, and should have
attempted to follow the rules that apply here.

Put simply, this movie is pure trash.  It was by far the worst movie I saw
in 1998, a year rife with embarrassing tripe.  Save your time, save your
money, save your brain.  Don't see it.
