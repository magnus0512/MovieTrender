Well i watched it on the plane and decided to re-watch it again. Hats
of to Elvira Ibragimova and Gulya Aliyeva for good acting and seeing
some chemistry between them. The movie is not bad to watch with a
family if no other options are available. Also it shows Kazan and
Tataristan for a bit ( some local landmarks and cuisine, also
mythological creatures), Why did i then gave it 2 out of 10 because it
again glorifies the Russians as this dominating culture where Russian
guy comes and saves the world while the Tatar guy(Rustem) who obviously
has some crush on Gulnara is supposed to work under him like his dog
and let the Tatar girl go out with Russian. The stress on ethnicity is
made in the movie. So for people who value Tatar culture its another
blow on the face and a new product of Putin Propaganda which has been
suppressing all the ethical movements since the Ivan the Terrible ( who
by the way is shown in good light). Good movie to watch pisses me off
that Tatar girl falls for Russian wanna be bad ass macho
