One of the best films of Ajith the actor. Brilliant portrayal of a life
searching music director Sridar .Ajith kills it with his underplay and
simple acting .The film is from the point of a human being and it stays
so that is main success of the film.I particularly feel this film
deserves a rating of 8 not 7 or lower. Thala the actor Shines and
Raghuvaran and Jyothika are brilliant .The director tries to show the
hero as a simple human being and succeeds in it. Music is good but
could have been great if all songs had clicked. Brilliant portrayal of
a life searching music director Sridar.this film deserves a special
mention for showing the actor side of Ajith
