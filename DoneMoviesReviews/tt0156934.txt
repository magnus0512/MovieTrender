True, there are some goofs, for the one who wants to find them. They're
not important, though.

The primary feature of this film is watching veteran expert actors do
their craft. Kristin Scott Thomas is beautiful and plays well the part
of a strong woman, but one who has been hurt. Same for Harrison Ford,
who, for the ladies, is just as beau as Kristin is belle for us guys.

Their hurt at the hands of their adulterous spouses brings them
together in an awkward manner, but one in which they find support in
each other. How they evoke their hurt feelings and their humanity
within on th screen is why these are such sought performers. The viewer
cannot help but feel what they feel, nor can one help wanting to cheer
them when they're together.

Yes, there are several action scenes involving angry corrupt cops, but
they only spice it up a little, and are not a significant part of the
movie.

For the lover of music, Dave Grusin provides a superb Jazz based
background, featuring trumpeter Terrence Blanchard. Like the actors,
Grusin shows why he is one of the most sought musical consultants in
the movie business. Blanchard shows why he's one the premiere
trumpeters on the scene.

Not a movie for the lovers of guts, blood, and gore. But for those who
want to see a lot of what makes us feel inside, watch a beautiful
English actress with big expressive blue eyes who can act, like
Harrison Ford, to the endless soothing accompaniment courtesy of Dave
Grusin and Terrence Blanchard, this is a move to watch with someone you
love. Preferably in bed.

I thought it deserved at least an 8.

I admit I have been a fan of Harrison Ford for many, many years now so it
didn't surprise me that I enjoyed his performance here. But I also enjoyed
the way the storyline developed and thought the casting was well done. I
don't know whether I "buy into" Kristin Scott Thomas as a Congresswoman but
she is a fine actress and a beautiful woman. I took notice of her in the
first Mission Impossible. Although her part was small she stuck out on the
screen.

Here her and Ford play people whose spouses are killed in an airplane crash.
They are seated together and this is where the plot takes off. Apparently
Ford, a police detective in Wash D.C., discovers that his wife was having an
affair. He further discovers that the affair was with the husband of a New
England Congresswoman.

The story takes on many subplots as Ford and Thomas find themselves drawn
together by revelations of their marriages, the uncovering of deceipt, and
the pure grief and anger over the loss of a loved one.

I think the movie is worthwhile either renting or catching on
cable.

I must be getting old because I was riveted to this movie from the first
time I saw it.  I'm watching it again right now on HBO.  It's a very simple
film about 2 people that fall in love after they found out that there
spouses were having an affair.  Plot is very thin, but the actors acted very
well in this movie.  In the mix of Kristen Scott Thomas running for congress
and Harrison Ford being an Internal Affairs cop, these two meet, under
unfortunate circumstances and fall in love.  I love the soundtrack.  Perfect
fit.  One thing I can't figure out, this movie had a budget of $68 million
dollars.  Were was it spent?  The plane crash or Harrison Ford's
salary?

Has there ever been a more dour, dreary and depressing movie romance than
"Random Hearts," a film that drones on for 131 grueling minutes and traps
two wonderful actors, Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas, in its
diabolical clutches?

Ford is a police sergeant working in internal affairs and Thomas is a New
Hampshire congresswoman whose paths cross when their spouses, who are having
a secret affair with each other, die in a plane crash.  Drawn together by
both circumstance and grief, the two begin a tentative love affair despite
the many complications it sets up.

The actors do their best given the stark limitations of portraying two
people overcome with despair, but the audience is nevertheless subjected to
more than two hours of unrelieved gloominess.  In a sense, it is a bit of a
relief to see a romantic film that is not all lightheartedness and carefree
silliness, but a subject as profound as the study of grief and loss on the
human psyche demands a less conventional, more imaginative and serious a
format than this film provides.  (The brilliant film, "Fearless," from 1993
is a startling case in point).  The actions of the characters often ring
false as when, for instance, the two grieving spouses, sitting in a car,
suddenly begin grappling in a wild sexual frenzy, a moment that elicits
giggles from the audience because it is so lacking in motivation and
preparation.  Moreover, the film pads out its narrative by constantly
cutting away to an irrelevant and wholly underdeveloped subplot involving
Ford's pursuit of a murderous cop - a sideshow that results in a completely
ludicrous shooting scene that undercuts the seriousness of the film's
purpose.

"Random Hearts" is an obvious and, perhaps, even admirable attempt to bring
a more mature, adult-oriented love story to the screen.  It's a shame, then,
that all involved seem to have confused dreariness with profundity and
gloominess with depth.

Random Hearts snuck up on me. Criticized for the implausibility of a)
the premise and b) the pairing of an IA cop and a Congresswoman, as
well as for its slowness, the film felt just fine to me , and even
ended up being surprisingly absorbing. I found my interest engaged as
the film cut back and forth between Ford's and Thomas's lives as they
first found out about, and dealt in very different ways in very
different environments with, their spouses' deaths and the subsequent
revelation that they were involved with other people. It could happen;
two people's philandering spouses could be on the same plane, the plane
could go down, the survivors could be brought together by the
aftermath. So what if it's improbable? Improbable is not the same as
far-fetched. So..what if it did happen? Why not speculate? 

Ford's and Thomas's performances are believable and nuanced. Instead of
finding their coupling implausible (opposite sides of the tracks--give
me a break) I felt it driven by a grief and betrayal neither party knew
how to deal with. The script does not bring them together too soon or
too easily, and the end of the film does not resolve their relationship
conventionally, either. Where I find it unsatisfying is when the
dialogue brings up interesting wrinkles in or insights into the
ramifications of the situation, personal and professional, but never
seems to pursue any of them very far. And if you make the mistake of
thinking about it too hard, Harrison Ford does seem about 10 years too
old for the part.

For five and a half bucks at Wal-Mart, with full length director
commentary and behind-the-scenes featurette, the DVD is well worth
owning. I don't think I would pay $20 for it on a bet, but my wife
might. OK, ten...

This is one of those movies you either love or hate. Having read some
of the reviews posted here its a blatantly obvious fact

Spoilers within

What I liked: Kristin Scott Thomas, I think she did a more than decent
job here I felt for her character. This particular actress is brilliant
at expressing emotion without the use of script this gift is put to
great use in this movie. I think that anyone who didn't appreciate this
fact were not watching the same movie i was. The chemistry between the
two leads was pretty good. 

what i didn't like: The plot was implausible didn't know this was a
book before being made into a movie it explains a lot. The script in
parts left lots to be desired. 

Overall I liked this movie I felt the two leads Ford and Scott Thomas
did great work. It is a mature story for mature people I think younger
viewers might not get the point. I enjoyed it a lot.
<|_=00=_|>
I had to write after reviewing the narrow opinions shown. If any of you
know of anyone who cheated on their spouse and then died without
explaining the reasons, you will have to appreciate this film. The
needing to know, the desire to know exactly when the affair started,
the want to know what the other attraction the other had that you did
not, all of those answers...the rummaging around personal belongings to
find some logical inference, the mission to make it all make
sense...All to find nothing that will fill in the gaps. This movie
depicted the horrors to one's own identity and self confidence. This
will always be one of my favorites.

Sydney Pollack directs a script based on a novel by Warren Adler. An
Internal Affairs Officer with the D.C. Police Dept and a woman running for
congress enter each others life when they are faced with the fact their
spouses were killed in a plane crash. It is discovered their spouses were in
the middle of a torrid affair. But life has to go on.

Harrison Ford is somewhat toned down, and this movie is below his normal
standards. Kristin Scott Thomas runs through a  gamut of emotions and plays
her part in a convincing manner. This movie runs a little long and I
understand why some people found it boring. It does seem to drag in places.
This time the movie does little to even do the trailers
justice.

Also featured are Charles Dutton, Director Pollack and briefly Peter Coyote
and Susanna Thompson.
<|_=00=_|>
**SPOILERS** Overlong and somewhat confusing drama involving an
airplane crash, Southern Airline flight from D.C to Miami, where two of
the crash victims were cheating on their spouses.

It's not much later that one of those being cheated on Washington D.C
internal affair police Sgt. Dutch Van Den Broeck, Harrison Ford, got
wind from her job that his old lady Peyton, Susanna Thompson, was on a
flight to Miami to do a fashion shoot for her employer Sacks 5th Av of
Washington D.C. Desperately trying to find out if Peyton was on the
doomed flight Ducth not only finds out that she was, through a morgue
photo at the crash site, but she was using an assumed name! Peyton was
using the name of the wife of the person that booked the flight Cullen
Chandler, Peter Coyote. Things get even more strange when it's
discovered that the late Mr. Chandler's wife, who he's been cheating
on, is non other then New Hampshire congresswoman Kay Chandler, Kristin
Scott Thomas, who's now in a life and death campaign for reelection!

The movie brings the two, Dutch & Kay, together in finding if in fact
it's true that they were being cheated on by their marriage partners.
And in the process they end up falling in love with each other! If it
was just that the film "Random Hearts" would have made for a pretty
good adult love story. Instead by putting into the film murder drug
dealing both police corruption and political chicanery the movie at
times was almost impossible to follow!

Dutch who should have taken a leave of absent from the D.C Police
Department in order for him to overcome his grief goes the exact
opposite direction. Instead he goes full blast in busting fellow D.C
cop George Beauford, Dennis Haysbert, for drug dealing by him getting,
which is very unprofessional on Dutch's part, very personal about it.
This not only leads to Dutch's top informant to get murdered but Dutch
almost ending up murdered himself! Or at the least losing his job or
being put behind bars for taking the law into his own hands! All of
this together with Dutch trying to find out if his wife Peyton was
untrue to him seemed too much for the poor guy to handle. As for Kay
she had far more pressing problems in the fact if her dead husband's
infidelity became public it could very well screw her out of a second
term in the US Congress!

***SPOILERS*** With the film being much too long, 133 minutes, as well
as complicated and confusing you completely lose interest in it at
about the one hour mark! It takes a while to realize what exactly Dutch
& Kay are so desperately looking for, their cheating partners secret
love nest, and when they, independent of each other, finally find it
what was the big shocking surprise anyway! It only proved to Dutch &
Kay, what we in the audience knew all along, what should have been
obvious to them right from the very beginning of the movie!
<|_=00=_|>
I didn't believe my eyes when I saw that this movie was valued with
just a 4.8. This is a very interesting movie. It isn't a typical
Hollywood movie, it demands from the watcher some work. But when you
are in the movie, you'll get a lot! The most important: excellent work
from Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas. Their characters are going
through heavy times and both Harrison and Kristin succeed fine very
well in bringing their characters emotion to the audience. The script
is excellent. The subject is most interesting. The subject is very
thorough worked out. It could happen in real. And finally: directed by
Sidney Pollack. So that means first class quality. Watch this great
movie and enjoy, you won't be disappointed!
