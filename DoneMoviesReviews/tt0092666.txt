Blake Edwards once again turned to his bread-and-butter genre, and kept
things nice and simple. However, for whatever reason, this downplayed
treat was and is often panned by critics left and right. I submit to
you that this is because most of us just don't get it.

I'll use the plot portent to tell you what this movie isn't, first of
all. Despite appearances, it's not about up-and-coming, wannabe yuppie
Walter Davis (Bruce Willis), not really about his blind date of the
title with the beautiful and potentially deadly Nadia Gates (Kim
Basinger), not about psychotic defense lawyer and jealous ex David
Bedford's (John Laroquette) attempts to break the two up and steal back
his first love, and not about the punches and rolls with which these
people, along with their families and acquaintances, must deal.

It's just my theory, but I think most of us didn't get this movie
because it was a humorous commentary on the time during which it was
made. This movie is all about the '80s; the yuppie culture, the
self-absorption, the repeated attempts of folks to find solace in
getting and having things, and our near-tragic couple's struggle to be
who they are, even if it doesn't fit with '80s yuppie culture, and
embrace what's important. Consider it--during her drunken binge, Nadia
assaults everything that could make Walter a yuppie as if it were a
well-organized plan. Walter, in turn, tries his hand at the same thing,
mostly upon David and car salesman brother Ted (late, great Phil
Hartman). Sure the details give a chuckle or two, but there's an almost
cerebral humor going on under the surface of the film, right at the
core, which pokes fun at a cornerstone of life in the '80s.

This led to the movie's downfall in favor, since the very people at
which the movie so heavily pokes fun were probably among the first ones
to see it premiere in the '80s. Even if they got it, they probably
didn't appreciate the joke. Essemtially, Edwards had spoofed the '80s
DURING the '80s. A gutsy move, and witting or unwitting, this gave it a
kind of staying power. It really is about more than you think.

So, if you're one of the lonely soldiers who likes the movie, try to
view it in this context and see what you think of it. If you hated it,
please try to observe this point of view, and again, see what you
think. Blind Date is one of the most different comedies to emerge from
this decade. No matter where you sit on the quality issue, perhaps it
deserves a second look.

I love this film. This was Bruce Willis' first box office film in a
leading role. It's a nice little film that has its funny moments. Blind
Date is not Citizen Kane, but it's sure a good film to watch on a day
off. When Kim Basinger gets drunk, that's where the funny moments
start. She goes from being a sweet southern belle to the date from
hell. She embarrasses him at a business dinner, goes ga-ga at a club,
gets his car lifted, and drives him to the point of insanity.
Meanwhile, ex-boyfriend Larroquette is stalking them around the town
driving them nuts. His character isn't given much depth, but he works
with it. All in all, it's a funny, innocent film that will make you
laugh.
<|_=00=_|>
I saw this film when it first came out and I laughed out loud at quite
a few scenes and thoroughly enjoyed it. Both Bruce Willis and Kim
Basinger are excellent and there was obvious comic chemistry between
them. There also plenty of great lines and performances from the
supporting cast too, especially from John Larroquette (Basinger's
psychotically obsessed erstwhile boyfriend). It was a complete mystery
to me why it was so panned on release, but reading some of the comments
here I am glad to see that this minor gem is finally getting the
recognition it deserves. All I'll add is: dobermans, golf balls,
moonwalking and an abject lesson in why you should never get your new
girlfriend drunk.

Bruce Willis plays a workaholic Walter Davis, whose brother Ted (Phil
Hartman) sets him up with this gorgeous woman Nadia Gates (Kim
Basinger).There's one thing about Nadia you should know, though.If she
has even a little bit of alcohol, she loses control and becomes wild.
The legendary director Blake Edwards directed Blind Date in 1987.It has
a brilliant cast.Bruce and Kim shine together at the time they were
both oh so young.Bruce turned 50 on Saturday and you could say he now
has the legend value.In this movie he takes the lead for the first
time. The next year, in 1988, he had an action classic called Die Hard
coming. Next year there should be coming Die Hard 4.0, so can't wait to
see that.Other actors do a great job too.There are John Larroquette as
David Bedford, Nadia's ex, who's doing an excellent job and William
Daniels, who's known as the voice of KITT in Knight Rider and George
Feeny in Boy Meets World is marvelous.Phil Hartman, who is sadly gone
now after his wife shot him in 1998, is wonderful.There certainly is a
cast to remember.I remember the first time I saw this movie back in
1994.I was the biggest Bruce Willis fan at the time and I enjoyed this
movie very much.These days it doesn't work quite as good, but it's
still pretty enjoyable flick.It offers some great comedic moments that
bring a grin on your face.

I've always loved Blake Edwards films and although this may not have been
regarded as his best work, I feel it was highly underrated.  Though
thoroughly implausible in many ways, I have to say that this movie made
me
laugh harder than any movie I've ever seen.  My sides literally hurt
after
watching it.  Although I've only seen it a few times since it came out
because none of the networks other than FX ever show it.  Why I don't
know
because it's really great!!

The main reason I'd have to say was John Laroquette as Nadia's psychotic
ex-boyfriend.  I was cracking up in every single scene he was in with his
standard line (I'll kill you).  His physical comedy is totally brilliant.
I
don't know why he didn't end up with a film career of his own.  But my
favorite scene has to be at the end when Nadia sees David hanging from
the
balcony of the house and squeals as they both dive into the pool and meet
at
the bottom in a kiss as they come up for air, with David yelling; "Nadia,
get your mouth off of him"!!

The movie is flawed in places though.  What are the odds that a house
moving
company would be moving a house at the exact moment that Nadia decides to
knock on the door.  And it is never explained why Walter is facing 2
years
in prison for his night on the town, yet David completely escapes any
legal
obligations for plowing his car into 3 seperate businesses.

Kim Basinger and Bruce Willis were great as well.  Though I didn't
understand why they dyed her gorgeous blonde hair brown.  Maybe because
her
image was supposed to be that of a sweet girl looking for love and
Edwards
thought she'd look too much the vamp and would lack credibility without
the
dye job.  It's also a good chance to see the late Phil Hartman early in
his
career.  I also loved the love song played at the end by Gary Morris and
Jennifer Warnes.

All in all, a fun ride from beginning to end.  If you haven't seen it
yet,
go out and rent it now.  You won't be disapointed, it's a 10+++!

One of my favorite 80's comedies.  Many very funny and memorable scenes.
It's a fun, light-hearted film about a blind date gone awry. Of course,
everything that can happen DOES happen on this particular date, and many
laughs are the result. The best scene is when Walter and Nadia go to a
restaurant after Nadia has had too much to drink. Apparently, she has some
sort of chemical imbalance to liquor, and things go haywire in front of
Walter's business associates.
<|_=00=_|>
"Walter Davis" (Bruce Willis) is a dedicated, hard-working employee for
a company that is pulling out all the stops to impress a possible new
client. As a result he desperately needs a new date for the office
dinner party. As luck would have it his brother "Ted Davis" (Phil
Hartman) just happens to know of someone named "Nadia Gates" (Kim
Basinger) who recently arrived in Los Angeles and so Walter takes a
chance and calls her on the phone. When he gets to her apartment he is
surprised at how attractive she is and wanting to loosen her up a bit
he gives her some champagne even though his brother warned him not to
give her any alcohol. Big mistake. Anyway, rather than reveal any more
of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will
just say that this was a pretty enjoyable comedy for the most.
Admittedly there were some slow scenes here and there but after the
first 15 minutes or so it really got going. I especially liked Kim
Basinger who performed quite well and looked absolutely gorgeous. Be
that as it may I rate this movie as above average.
<|_=00=_|>
This movie is an easy-going one. Light atmosphere, nice gags, good and
not-so-good joking all the way, young Kim and Bruce, and fine
urban/suburban scenery. It's kind of a very warm family movie that can
suit nearly every evening when there is nothing to do (though some
humour is rather adult). My opinion is that they could not handle the
script better than this.

Don't know how about others, but to me this movie is very neat and
quite funny. Though they shouldn't have called the dog "Rambo", while
"First Blood" is one of my absolute favourites. How dare they! Solid 7
out of 10. Thanks for attention.

Released in 1987, "Blind Date" stars Bruce Willis as a workaholic who
is forced to get a blind date (Kim Basinger) for an important company
dinner meeting. Everything goes awry when she has too much to drink.
John Larroquette co-stars as the girl's crazy ex and Stephanie Faracy
has a small role.

This is a likable farce with quite a few laughs, but not enough to give
it a higher rating. Being shot in 1986, everything about it screams
mid-80s Â– the big hair, hideous mullets and music with electronic
drums. Plus it's cool seeing Willis when he was young and with a full
head of hair. On the negative side, even farces have to stay somewhere
within the bounds of plausibility, but "Blind Date" sometimes goes
over-the-top goofy, like at the midpoint when the house moves away
while hooligans run wild in the neighborhood. Nevertheless, this is
worthwhile for some laughs, particularly if you like the cast.

The film runs 95 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.

GRADE: B- or C+ (5.5/10)
<|_=00=_|>
An enjoyable piece of fluff, built solely around the notion that Kim
Basinger has some kind of metabolic disorder that renders her a
reckless drunk if she takes the slightest bit of alcohol. Workaholic
Bruce Willis is talked into taking her to dinner at a fancy French
restaurant in LA but has underestimated the magnitude of her problem
and sees to it that she has a bit of champagne.

What follows is an amusing concoction of slapstick, insane dialog,
embarrassing situations, and character development in which Bruce
Willis turns from a pragmatist into a Dionysian fool.

These are well-off people we're talking about. They live in the kind of
Southern California milieu in which everyone is expected to have a
swimming pool. I counted eight people who were pushed, fell, or were
forced to dive into one of the pools to escape a a dog. The hedges are
all perfectly barbered, the grass neatly trimmed, the interiors
impeccable, and the acreage infinite, all rather like my place.

The comedy is usually slapstick. People fall off balconies, ladders,
and, in one case, a tree after being hit accidentally on the head with
a golf ball. One running gag is effective by any measure. John
Larroquette, as Basinger's jealous lover, follows the couple in his car
and when his attention is distracted, which it is, three times, his car
leaves the road and invariably smashes through a plate glass window --
once a paint shop, once a pet store, and I forget the third. Each time
he picks up souvenirs of his accident until he finds himself speeding
along in a battered, paint-splashed car, his own clothes and face
varicolored, and being blinded from behind by some kind of chirping
primate. And this is a man who, though a lecher, is rich and dignified.

The burlesque alternates with less frenzied moments, and the dialog is
sometimes funny. Larroquette is a lawyer who has decided to defend
Willis in court. His very presence draws an angry comment from the
judge, William Daniels, who is perfect in the role. "I hoped never to
see you in this courtroom again," snarls the judge. Larroquette
approaches the judge and smoothly blackmails him into letting the
defendant go, while he himself promises never to practice in the
judge's jurisdiction again. Daniels scowls, ponders the proposition,
then finally agrees, because the prospect of getting rid of Larroquette
is simply too bright for him to resist. With a smile, the lawyer leans
across the bench and says earnestly, "Thanks, Dad." 

There are some weaknesses too. On those few sips of wine, Basinger
stays drunk for a long time, and when she sobers up and wants to go
home, the crazed Willis drags her to another party, which he invades.
There he swills down booze, gets loaded, and jiggles matzoh balls while
insulting the guests. Drunks -- seriatim. And of course not all the
gags succeed. But when they do, they can be subtle as well as obvious.
"Get on with the wedding," Daniels orders, "and kill the dog." The
minister begins his intonations while, off screen, a distant gunshot is
heard.

Blake Edwards is adept at handling comedies. Sometime's he's made
something out of virtually nothing, as in "The Party." He does pretty
well by this script.
