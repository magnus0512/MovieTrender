This movie was great, and I hope it comes out on DVD real soon. Beatty
became Reed in more than one sense--not only did he act the part, but he
directed the movie in a way reminiscent of the kind of "new journalistic"
style that Reed and his fellow MASSES writers pioneered, mixing the drama
with interviews of people who knew JR, Louise, etc.

The film also sort of puts forward the question, "What if, instead of
running back to Russia (to die of kidney failure and mistreatment by the
CP), Jack Reed had stayed in this country to build the CP? Would it have
turned out to become Stalinist?" According to Howe and Coser, who wrote a
good book on THE AMERICAN COMMUNIST PARTY, much like Rosa Luxemburg and Karl
Liebknecht in Germany, Reed was the ONLY leader who was independent, who had
some real backbone.

The best part of the movie is when Emma Goldmann, played by Maureen
Stapleton, tells Jack that "it doesn't work" (i.e. statist, bureaucratic
socialism that the Bolsheviks were instituting as a grossly mistaken
response to the economic crisis and Allied invasion of Russia after the
Revolution). And then his rebellion against the lying propaganda of
Zinoviev. Kind of hits me right now that Jerzy Kosinski should play
Zinoviev--didn't he commit suicide when he was exposed as a plagiarist?
Where is the line between art and reality, politics and life?

Of course I loved the romantic reality between Beatty, Bryant, and Nicholson
(Reed, Bryant, and Eugene O'Neill). And the cynicism that Reed expresses
about the Democrats and Wilson is certainly apropos today.

Reds, a succinct, controversial title totally typical of a major directorial
outing by Warren Beatty.  We always knew that Beatty was on the left, but a
film glamourising a known Communist who defected to the USSR and is buried
within the Kremlin.  How the studios let him make it is a mystery to me, but
I suppose that the name Warren Beatty was enough.

The film is long, and not for the light-hearted.  It covers the broad canvas
of early 20th Century American socialism. Concentrating first on Reeds
efforts to form an American Socialist party, before moving to Russia; Beatty
plays Jack Reed, the playboy writer, journalist and socialist.  He opposes
the war after initially supporting Wilson at the Democratic convention.
After the Russian Revolution he becomes enamoured with the newly founded
Soviet Union, as does his wife and sparring partner Louise Bryant,
marvellously played by Diane Keaton who is excellent as the proto-feminist
Bryant.  Self-assured and very sexy, and her tragic love triangle between
her, Reed and Jack Nicholson's character is brilliant.  A number of other
actors also crop up, including Paul Sorvino and M. Emmet Walsh.

One of the most important films of its generation, and every movie fan
should make this compulsory viewing.  Any aspiring left-wing intellectual
should also make this compulsory viewing - there were Communists and
Socialists in America, and one of them is even buried in the Kremlin.  The
USSR may be reviled these days, but you cannot deny the hope and utopianism
that swept the world in those first few years after the 1917 Revolution.
Beatty brings all this marvellously to the screen in Reds.

I am old enough to have lived through (probably) three different
Americas. These are radically different worlds. It isn't just the mood,
styles or state of the economy; its the adoption of a whole cosmology.
Religions change under our feet. Family, love, belonging. These things
are malleable yet largely beyond our control and we forget what "things
were like." Memory always is constructed in terms of the present world. 

Always.

So projects like this are necessary. We cannot know who we are unless
we remind ourselves who we were.

The ordinary fold here is a romance, folded into grand political
actions. Here they are a bit more cerebral than usual, but never
getting past the notion of simple justice.

The more unusual and complex fold is that we see a story based on real
events and people. Interspersed with that story are interviews of
people who were personally involved in the story. These are remarkable,
the way they are captured and the way they are edited to overlap with
and annotate the story. But much more engaging is that these are
enticing people, many with minds and phases that invite us into their
faces Â— made warmer and more open by Beatty's camera. I compare this to
the "Up" serious and the contrast is astonishing. True, here we want to
be informed about the lives of others, and the "Up" goals pretend that
the people randomly selected decades ago are remotely worth knowing.

But these folks are. We want more, simply based on their implicit
invitation, and we carry ourselves into the narrative more forcefully,
sort of like the characters do. This is folding doing its job and doing
it well. They remember. I remember, and therefore am.

Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.
<|_=00=_|>

"Reds" is a 200-minute epic masterpiece which deals with left-wing American
journalist John Reed (Warren Beatty in an Oscar-nominated performance) and
his coverage of the Russian Revolution of the 1910s.  Beatty's passion is
what carries this ambitious film, which could have easily been a
multi-million dollar disaster.  His Oscar-winning direction, screenplay, and
overall performance carry the film as far as it can possibly go.  The
top-flight performances by Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson (both
Oscar-nominated), and Maureen Stapleton (Oscar-winning) all add great depth
to the performance.  Paul Sorvino, Edward Herrmann, and Gene Hackman also
make lasting impressions in supporting roles.  Overall a great achievement
all the way around.  5 stars out of 5. 
<|_=00=_|>

Warren Beatty's Reds follows only Gone With The Wind in my list of favourite
films. This movie is both a love story, and a documentary. It educates the
viewer not just on John Reed and his comrades, but on WWI era society in
general.

This brilliant script, (which, like the writings of Jack Reed expresses his
political feelings with the same poetic eloquence as his love poems to his
wife Louise), is interspersed with commentary from Jack's contemporaries,
who tell the history from their own unique perspectives. As the truth of
what was going on in that community is such an illusive thing, the only way
to tell this story accurately was to show the often completely
opposite view points of what was going on as told by the people for whom
this history is a first hand memory.

The acting in Reds is breath taking. Every member of this, extremely large,
cast committed fully to their characters. One feels a true connection to
even those characters who lurked in the background with only occasional
lines. The most notable performances were by Beatty himself, (who's
embodiment of Jack Reed was incredible), Diane Keaton, (who portrayed all
the facets of Louise's personality with stunning realism), Jack Nickelson,
(who delivers O'Neil's quick witted dialogue with an almost frightening
cynicism), and Maureen Stapelton, (who conveyed an amazing strength as Emma
Goldman). While these actors were the most prominently featured, all the
actors delivered noteworthy performances as far as I'm concerned.

The political history covered in this movie is nothing if not vast. This is
proof of Beatty's most impressive knowledge of history. This is a film I
would recommend be shown in schools, as one the most in depth study of
American communism on screen to date.

Reds is truly an inspiration, and should be seen by every actor, director,
writer, liberal, film maker, history buff & movie lover! You will not be
disappointed!

Warren Beatty's 'Reds' is a terrific film that is not only great story telling
in the conventional Hollywood way but also has an original style of narration
told in many ways from the point of view of witnesses to the real story who
lived
during the days the film is centred around.

The film is especially significant to view since the iron curtain in Russia
has come down and 'Reds' is a movie that never looks dated and stresses the
fact that morals at the early part of the 20th century were about the same
as they are now. It's just that no one discussed it back then and it
emphasizes that times change but people don't.

With top notch performances from the entire cast, it is one of the few films
to be nominated for an Oscar in all four acting categories and was
victorious in the Best Supporting Actress category for Maureen Stapleton
although the film's best performance comes from Diane Keaton who should have
won her second Oscar.

To date, Beatty is the only film maker to be Oscar nominated for Best
Director, Actor, Screenwriter and Producer twice for the same film.  The
other time was for 1978's 'Heaven Can Wait'.
<|_=00=_|>

Warren Beatty makes himself the only director to get Oscar nominations in
Best Producer (picture), director, actor and writer twice (Heaven Can Wait
is the other one), and he won his only Oscar (besides his honorary Thalberg
award in 2000) for direction here.  And it is well deserved.  Mainly because
this is the best film about communism and other political issues ever made. 

Here, Beatty portrays journalist and idealist John Reed to maximum
potential.  He also comes of great with Diane Keaton as his love.  Long, yet
immensly entertaining and interesting, which was one of the few political
films (besides maybe South Park) that got me thinking about communism.  By
the way, this film also won best conematography (Vittoro Storatto) and Best
Supporting Actress (Maureen Stapleton as Emma Goldman), though I think it
should've also won Oscars for Nicholson and Beatty.  One of the better films
(top 20) of the decade.  A+
<|_=00=_|>

An engrossing film about John Reed's
love affair with Louise Bryant and his struggles
in the midst of the Russian Revolution. There
are great performances from Beatty, Keaton,
Nicholson (excellent as Eugene O'Neill) and
Stapelton in her Oscar winning performance
as Emma Goldman. Beatty's precision and
timing in the use of his camera in this picture
is a superb achievement. There is a touch
of David Lean in director Beatty in this 
film. The color, the editing, the sound. 
All of those important filmic elements are
at play here in great form. Beatty won the
Best Director Oscar, but lost the Best Picture
award to Chariots of Fire. 
<|_=00=_|>
Bolshevik leader V.I. Lenin once wrote, "The capitalists will sell us
the rope with which we will hang them."

Lenin's quote came to mind when I was watching one of the most
spellbinding movies to come along in years,and not since David Lean's
brilliant 1965 epic classic "Doctor Zhivago" hasn't been a movie in
recent memory that has come close. That motion picture is
"Reds",released in 1981 by Paramount Pictures. The film was Warren
Beatty's peeve project which he served not only as it star,but also the
co-writer and direction. Director Warren Beatty's epic love story about
American writers John Reed and Louise Bryant,set amid of the turbulence
of American politics in the 1910's World War I and the Russian
revolution that set this movie into plain focus. The movie itself is
astounding to behold and is a tragic love story between the writers
John Reed(Warren Beatty),and Louise Bryant(Diane Keaton). But it
creatively used artsy,radical Greenwich Village in the 1910's-and such
as real-life characters as playwright Eugene O'Neill(Jack
Nicholson),and anarchist activist Emma Goldman(Maureen Stapleton)-as
well as the drama of the Russian Revolution and the subsequent civil
war as the principal landscapes in which their relationship plays out.

Director Beatty also made creative use of on-camera "testimony" by the
likes of novelists Henry Miller and Rebecca West,Republican politician
Hamilton Fish,comic George Jessel and civil libertarian Roger Baldwin.
These senior citizens recall,with varying degrees of historical
accuracy,Reed,Bryant and the times in which they lived. "Reds" shows
convincingly that many of the contemporary issues in politics and
culture have their antecendents in the first debates of the 20th
century. Debates over birth control and abortion,marriage and
commitment,public life versus private life,revolution versus reform are
given full expression from varying viewpoints throughout the lengthy
film(which runs over three hours). To Beatty's credit,his film captures
the excitement the Bolshevik revolution stirred,both inside and outside
Russia while revealing how the Bolshevik leadership quickly began to
suppressing dissent within the revolutionary ranks on the way to
becoming a dictatorship with a country that is in constant turmoil.
Beatty's efforts certainly paid off artistically,bringing him prestige
to him and Paramount making "Reds" a huge box office success for the
studio when it premiered in theatres around Christmas of 1981.

"Reds" became one of the top highest grossing pictures of that year,and
it paid off in high standards too. "Reds",which received 12 Academy
Award nominations including Best Picture,lost an upset to Hugh Hudson's
"Chariots Of Fire" in the Best Picture category. However it won three
Oscars for Best Director(Warren Beatty),Best Supporting Actress(Maureen
Stapleton),and Best Cimematopgraphy(Vittorio Storaro).
Eventually,"Reds" made more than $40 million at the domestic box
office,and once international figures were added in,it became one of
the top grossing films of the 1980's. A feat Warren Beatty is still
proud of to this day.
<|_=00=_|>

This is an interesting film, all the more so because it is meant to tell a
true story (insofar as any film of real events is true!)

I suppose you'll either like it or loathe it. If you like it, good; it isn't
a bad film, but a bit of an idea of European history will help
you.

If you you fall into the latter category loathe it because you think it's a
bad film not because of the stupid bigotry shown in some of the other
reviews here which seem to be so hung up on the USA and Mom and apple pie
that they see "Commies" in even thinking about the event of the early 20th
century!

After seeing it it made me interested enough to find out about John Reed.
You might not like what he thought, you might not like Warren Beatty and
what he thinks but for heaven's sake don't rubbish this film simply because
it's about a political system you may not like, or have been indoctrinated
not to like!

It's not brilliant but neither is it a "love poem to communism".
