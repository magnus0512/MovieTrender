"A Soldier's Story," directed by Norman Jewison, tells a very powerful and
tragic tale of black racism in WWII America.  It is equally puzzling and
disturbing and will leave you thinking about it for a long time to
come.

The story takes place at a military base in the American South during the
last full year of the Second World War, in 1944.  Sergeant Vernon Waters,
a
Black man, is shot to death.  The locals, as well as the Black enlisted
men
at the base, believe it to be the work of the Ku Klux Klan.  Captain
Davenport, also a Black man, as well as the first Black officer most of
the
men at this base have ever seen, is asked to investigate this.  The White
officers all want to see this matter brought to a swift and tidy
conclusion
in order to prevent what they see as a potential race riot between the
Black
soldiers and local Whites around town.

Davenport (deftly played by the late Howard E. Rollins Jr.) questions the
enlisted men at the base, and begins to learn that the murdered
sergeant(Adolph Ceaser in an Oscar-nominated performance) had no shortage
of
enemies, White and Black.

Through a series of flashbacks, we learn that Waters is a man of great
personal pride and dignity, a man who believes that the African-American
race has great potential to "take it's rightful place in history"
alongside
the White race in America.  But his pride is also fueled by a terrible
hatred of Black men, mostly Southern men, who he believes are hurting the
race by presenting themselves as lower-class bumpkins; the stereotypical
shiftless, lazy, ignorant types; the smiling, singing clowns; the
"yassah-boss niggers."

One soldier, C.J. Memphis, a simple but charming, illiterate,
guitar-strumming man, comes to personify these character traits in Waters'
eyes.  The clash between those two personalities is a crucial centerpiece
to
this movie's message.

Ceaser is astonishing as Waters, a man so full of loathing and bile
towards
his own people, you can feel it oozing off the screen.  His best moment
occurs in a bar where he stares into a mirror and talks in a dark tone
about
his unit's heroic efforts in France in the First World War, and how one
Black soldier destroyed that sterling image in the minds of many White
Frenchmen.....and what Waters did in response.  It's chilling.

An undervalued film that you may have to look a little harder in your
local
video store to find, but well worth the effort!

This is one of my all time favorite movies.  The thing that I find so
amazing is that few people have ever heard of it much less seen it.  The
acting and story line is excellent.  This is one of those great whodunits
with a great twist that compels us to examine our stereotypes and
presumptions.  If you find yourself looking for a great tip at the video
store check this movie out.  I think you'll enjoy it.

Commerating the 20th Anniversary of a brilliant classic!

This was one of the most powerful films that came out in 1984. Director
Norman Jewison(In The Heat Of The Night)adaptation of the Puliitzer
Prize-winning play(by Charles Fuller) and numerous NAACP awards for
best achievement in African-American literature,tells about the
ramificiations of racism and loyalty through the prism of blacks in the
military,revealed through a mystery set in the 1940's deep South.
Howard E. Rollins(Ragtime,and from the TV series In The Heat Of The
Night)plays a military investigator,Captain Davenport,who is assigned
to the murder of a drill instructor,Sergeant Waters,played by Adolph
Caesar(The Color Purple),who was in charge of a black platoon during
World War II. Under pressure from his superiors to wrap his
investigation up quickly,Rollins instead delves deeply into the
relationships between the despised drill instructor and his
men,uncovering lies and animousity,and confronting the question of what
it means to be black in a white man's world. Rollins delivers a
riveting,stoic,emotional lead into the role of Captain Davenport while
Caesar gives an electrifying performance as the Sergeant. A lot of
fresh faces gives brilliant performances throughout the film including
one from a youthful Denzel Washington,who makes an early appearance as
a soldier with a deep grudge against the drill instructor and a deep
mistrust of Rollins' investigator. Look for appearances by Larry Riley,
David Alan Grier,Robert Townsend,and Patti LaBelle. A powerfully
written story that makes the most of its large and impressive ensemble
cast which still is enthralling--some 20th after its release.

MPAA Rating: PG-For Language,Racial Overtones and Comment,Violence.

<|_=00=_|>

This is an excellent film, at it's heart a case study in human psychology,
but also a mystery and an intriguing one at that.  The cast, mostly
unknowns
at the time, is fantastic and contains many now-familiar faces, most
notably
Denzel Washington and David Alan Grier.  Adolph Caesar was nominated for an
Oscar and Howard Rollins, Jr. probably should have been.  Another highlight
(at least for me) are the songs sung by Larry Riley and Patte LaBelle.
This
is a gem of a film, one that is most highly recommended.

Canadian director Norman Jewison once took a tour of the U.S. south in the
mid-1940s following his high school graduation and was shocked to see the
way that black people were treated by white people. Jewison's intense
hitch-hiking journey led to a career which includes credits like "In the
Heat of the Night" and "The Hurricane". However his best film is probably "A
Soldier's Story", an intense character-study that deals with
African-American soldiers in Louisiana during World War II. Master Sergeant
Adolph Caesar (Oscar-nominated) has been murdered. Enter investigator Howard
E. Rollins (also African-American) who tries to figure out the case. What
follows are intense flashbacks and the realization that Caesar was despised
not only by white people (the primary suspects at the start) but also his
own men (all African-American). The mystery twists and turns into chaos and
in the end it is not a sure thing if the crime will ever be solved. A really
chilling film that is top-notch in all cinematic departments. Robert
Townsend, Larry Riley, David Allen Grier and yes the Denzel Washington are
the soldiers that make the most lasting impressions in this brilliant piece
of the cinema. Without a doubt one of the finest productions of the 1980s. 5
stars out of 5.

The problem with a film like "A Soldier's Story" is that too many will
skip it because it is one of those black social films. They expect a
boring bitchy sermon. That's too bad, because they miss out on one of
the best ensemble films of the 1980s, not to mention a tough mystery
story that navigates deep psychological waters in delivering a message
far less rosy and doctrinaire than you might expect.

It is World War II, and just outside a Louisiana army base for
"colored" troops, a black master sergeant is shot to death on a
deserted road. Whites from the nearby town are suspected. Howard
Rollins Jr. plays Capt. Davenport, a black lawyer sent by Washington to
investigate. The expectation is he will ruffle no feathers and work
instead at being what the base commander calls "a credit to your race."
But Davenport quickly makes clear he isn't anyone's token, even if it
means pressing white suspects or investigating the possibility that
whites didn't kill Sgt. Waters at all.

Today, you see the film and notice Denzel Washington has a major role
as one of Sgt. Waters' men. But the star of the film is neither him nor
Rollins, but Adolph Caesar as the doomed Sgt. Waters. "They still hate
you!" he almost laughs as he is being murdered, and one of the many
mysteries sorted out in the film is that Waters wasn't talking to the
killer but himself.

Waters is bent out of shape not only over white American attitudes
towards blacks, but his own attitude about how a black person can be
more acceptable in white society. He expresses admiration for Nazi
Germany, noting that they have a commendably direct way at getting at
the problem of racial purity. For him, the black race is held down by a
certain type of southern black, "geechies" he calls them, who play to
white stereotyping by not speaking correct English and so on.

Caesar tackles Sgt. Waters as if his were a Shakespearean role, and in
a way it is, Shylock crossed with Richard III, filtered through a
multitude of American racial prisms, white on black, black on white,
black on black. His every twitch and body shudder come over perfectly,
especially when you watch a second time. Even in smaller moments, like
when he's getting ready to beat the tar out of Denzel, and is joshing
with the other non-coms, he never lets go of that glint in his eye or
his hold on the viewer's jugular.

Though Rollins and Washington are both very good in support, even
better is Art Evans as Waters' sad flunky, Wilkie, who gives two
contradictory depositions to Davenport and the deepest insight as to
what made Waters tick. Dennis Lipscomb as Capt. Taylor is also
fantastic, a white officer who tells Davenport frankly he doesn't want
him investigating the murder because of the color of his skin. Taylor's
not a bigot, mind, he just wants justice and fears a black officer
won't be able to make an arrest in Louisiana. Taylor's more socially
awkward than anything else, and scripter Charles Fuller, working from
his great "A Soldier's Play," has a lot of fun with him and his
exchanges with Davenport.

When Davenport tells him of an especially cruel trick Waters played,
Taylor refuses to believe it. "Colored people aren't that devious," he
says, a nice line in that you discover Taylor's racism and his naive
decency simultaneously.

In his DVD commentary, director Norman Jewison doesn't mention his
earlier "In The Still Of The Night," which is odd given the many
parallels between the two films. Both are murder mysteries set in the
American South with blacks and whites butting heads. Rollins even went
on to appear in "Still Of The Night" the TV series. I don't see this
film as a copy of that earlier one, but a variation on the same theme,
and in many ways an improvement.

Instead of noble Sidney Poitier, you have a deep raft of black acting
talent representing a variety of different attitudes and moral
shadings. Real stock is taken, too, of America's racial divide, how
people can still feel American enough to want to die for their country
even if it won't let them drink from the same water fountain. There's
something heartbreaking about the scene where we see the black soldiers
celebrating being sent off to combat, in the wake of what happened to
WWI hero Sgt. Waters. Will they come back with memories of their own
Cafe Napoleon?
<|_=00=_|>

I can't even say this movie is underappreciated and overlooked b/c it did
get a nomination for Best Picture...but I'll say it is anyway! :)  This
movie is not just a great "black" film, it's a great film, period.  Howard
Rollins shows the great actor he once was (and makes you saddened by how
his
later career after "Heat of the Night" turned out) and you cannot beat the
who's who of the rest of the cast: Robert Townsend, Denzel, Adolph
Caesar...
I'm glad I found out it's on DVD with commentary by Mr. Jewison cause it
deserves the format (although more goodies would've been
great).
If you haven't seen it, you must.  For excellent acting and story it rarely
gets better than this one...

     A Soldier's Story, (1984) is the story of an Army sergeant who is

found murdered in cold blood. Whodunnit? The choices are many 

in this engrossing, complex morality play which is set in the

backdrop of the segregated Army of WWII. (Only 60 years ago!)

This is truly a black eye on the military if there ever was one.

Several  future stars are featured here including Oscar winner

Denzel Washington, David Alan Grier, and the excellent  Howard

Rollins Jr. who stars as an Army Capt. and lawyer sent from

Washington to unravel this mysterious killing. The movie really

belongs to Adolph Ceasar as the murdered sergeant , however. A

WWI veteran and medal winner he constantly affirms the the ability

of the black soldier in a segregated Army as professional, efficient

and courageous, but who fails to stand for any "weaknesses" he

sees in his men, many of whom are naieve country boys, whose

ways he believes are keeping black men subjugated in Uncle

Sam's Army. One chiling scene not to be missed is Ceasar's

solliliquy in the bar with his staff sergeant, in which he describes

an incident in France in WWI. An excellent movie which should be

viewed as part of recent US history. Highly recommended.

A murder mystery among black soldiers during World War II - in the last
years of the segregated military. 

The plot is completely unpredictable but fascinating. The characters are
strongly written, very believable and varied.  

**** SPOILERS **** 

Like the best movies, the central motivation for the crime runs away from
cliche. In his rage for an idea - that black men be given respect and have
dignity - the sergeant doesn't care about individuals and their welfare.
Anyone under his command whom he believes retards that respect from being
accorded - or who fails to reflect pride and dignity as a black man - must
be punished - regardless of their warmth or personality.

The fact that rural black southern men seem in the early 1940s to this
sergeant to be relatively old-fashioned in their relaxed ways (compared to
northern blacks - most of whom lived in large  cities and work in large
industries), in their acceptance of a "second class" citizenship and in
their deference to whites, drives the sergeant wild with hatred.

In that sense, this movie is like the French play and movie, "Danton" - for
the villain, the individual is unimportant (no matter how sweet, how
well-loved by others) and his welfare is subordinated to a greater idea
(whether fraternite and egalite for all mankind in Danton or respect and
dignity for the black man in America in A Soldier's Story). Of course, like
in Danton, the general principle (egalite or respect) causes the authority
(here, the sergeant) to treat the person retarding the principle's
acceptance at least as badly as the injustice from which the reformer (the
sergeant) seeks relief.

The murder at the heart of this movie is the revenge by those who care for
individual human beings more than they care for the general principles about
how those individuals should be treated. 

**** SPOILERS END **** 

I found the setting and characters both believable and intensely
interesting, and enjoyed the frequent humor (e.g., the reaction of
townspeople and black soldiers to a black captain). The reaction of the
regiment to the news that they were being "allowed" to go into action
against the Axis powers was moving - and the way this news overshadowed
(among the soldiers) the resolution of the murder, was very well done and
believable. 

This is one terrific movie - truly one of the best American movies of the
1980s. I fear that the largely black cast might cause whites to relegate the
movie to to a separate "black audience" category - it shouldn't be seen that
way - its appeal is completely universal.
<|_=00=_|>
Directed by Norman Jewison, A Soldier's Story is a gripping film that
tells the story of an African-American captain and lawyer who is sent
to the Deep South to investigate the murder of a sergeant. But the film
does not just tell the story of the investigation; it also opens up a
whole new state of affairs for the audience to see. Jewison shows the
hard-core racism that was present during World War II. Racism is the
central theme that surrounds the murderous plot.

The movie takes place in 1944, on a black army base in Louisiana where
the men eagerly wait to be sent to Europe to fight World War II.
Captain Davenport is brought in from Washington D.C. to inspect the
unexpected murder of Sergeant Waters. Captain Davenport tediously
interviews each man who was under Waters' command. All men gives his
story and about how their great or not so great encounters with the
late Sergeant Waters. The movie constantly flashes back and forth
between the past and present as the men tell their stories to
Davenport, explicitly introducing the different attitudes and
animosities towards Sergeant Waters. All the men that Davenport
interviewed had a motive to kill.

This film explores a variety of racial behaviors that African-American
men had to face at that time. Not only does it show racism from whites
to blacks but also from black to blacks. Jewison does not spare the
audience's ears as every sort of racial slur is thrown at the men, with
the cruelest racist words coming from the black Sergeant Waters. He
gives us a scandalous taste of this unsympathetic prejudice and bigotry
through-out the entire picture and then at the end, just like that, all
the arguments, issues, and chauvinism between all the men on the base
is solved. The men finally get to fight in the war, everyone is
content, and saluting one another; as if none of the narrow-minded
racist name-calling and bias misconceptions never happened. Jewison
failed to give this movie a "real" ending.

How can Jewison, a white man from Canada ever be able too see that
something like this would never happen? How can an entire movie that is
built on preconceptions and injustice have an ending with a white man
giving a black man a hand up and saluting other white officers without
any acknowledgement of the unfair treatment that was handed to him?
Jewison did an acceptable job displaying life for a black man in 1944,
searching for his own identity in a world of whites who believe they
are superior; I just think that representing open racism as "OK" is not
OK.

However, the acting is superb. Denzel Washington in particular, did an
exceptional job, playing Private Peterson, as he resisted Sergeant
Waters and refused to be talked down. Even though he couldn't back all
his talking and lost in a fist fight against Waters, he did admirably
well as he refused to be disparaged by another black man with only a
few stripes more than him. Adolph Caesar, who starred as Sergeant
Waters, also did a delightful job portraying a hateful man who enjoyed
putting black men away who made his race look bad. Although he was
malicious and intolerable towards his all black troop, he became a
character you'd love to hate. Because of his sharp wit, small stature
and roughness, he gave A Soldier's Story a slight sense of mean humor.
Moreover, he gives the audience a sense of black on black hate and
opens up a new perspective of how blacks had to endure racism with-in
their own culture.

A Soldier's Story is highly recommendable. It's a type of movie that
keeps it's audience captivated through-out the entire view and never
gets dull. The film is unpredictable and comical but only to a certain
extent. Addressing serious issues, there are times when A Soldier's
Story draws the audience in to sympathize with the characters and feel
their pain. However, a special appearance from Patti LaBelle will help
ease that pain and standing up and shouting is the only option when she
blows only like Patti LaBelle can.
