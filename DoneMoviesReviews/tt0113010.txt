Can Cindy Crawford act? Not really, but well enough to scream and run from
one overblown action scene to another, taking the odd breather for showers
(plural) and changes of clothes. 

I kind of enjoyed this brainless tosh. Cinders looks great, adequately
playing an uncompromising, smarty-pants attorney. Baldwin is the cop
determined to guard her body when people start trying to kill her. He just
about pulls off the hardass cop routine, but never really musters the
enthusiasm to look like he's enjoying it. 

The bad guys glower and plot, hunting the fleeing pair down with ruthless
skill (and some rather suspect computer trickery), then cocking things up
each time allowing them to escape. It's hugely violent, fast moving, loud,
full of swearing etc.,  all the things you associate with nineties action
fodder, and finishes off with a big enough bang. Don't expect much, and you
shouldn't be disappointed.

Oh, and if you're wondering about nudity, Cindy does indeed Â‘get them out
for the lads', and Baldwin shows his butt.

I like Cindy Crawford. I really do. I respect the class she has maintained
in an often classless fashion and modeling industry.  But some people
should
stick to what they know.

Cindy, my God! In this movie, you were just in your lovely apartment
overlooking the water. Your apartment is then blown up, you are blown off
the balcony into the water, your cat is toast and all your possessions are
gone. Oh, and by the way, a bunch of very bad people are now trying to
shoot
you dead. You get out of the cold water, run for your life and get taken
to
a safe house where the 2nd rate Baldwin asks you `How do you feel?' And
Cindy says with the intensity of a heroin  addict, `Like my life just
exploded. What is this place, Motel Hell?' She said it like she was
reading
the phone book! A real actress would have been looking at the cop like he
was nuts! And she would have delivered the lines accordingly. It got
worse.

Did you see at the very first scene in the movie where Cindy's character
is
jogging and gets shot? Did you notice her slowing down to hit her mark and
wait for the shot? I've never heard or seen anyone more stilted and
lifeless
except for a really bored telemarketer.

The writing was just BAD, and the movie was just about look how good Cindy
looks after being dumped in water and having no shower. Notice her lips
still had color? Did they have the long-lasting stuff back then?

Luckily it wasn't the kind of bad where you can't sit and laugh at it. You
can sit and laugh at this one. In fact, you don't have a
choice.

In my opinion most blockbusters are watchable movies. Some are good, some
are not so good. Some are even quite bad, but they try so hard to offer
something for everyone that there usually are at least some things in the
movie you like. But because they do offer something for everyone, they
usually also have some things you don't like. However, once in a while a
film comes along which focuses solely on it's own target audience. Sometimes
the critics and fans of so-called 'quality cinema' are the target audience.
In those cases we have films like "American Beauty". Sometimes fans of
sex-related teen-comedies are the target audience and we have a film like
"American Pie". And sometimes fans of pure action-entertainment are the
target audience and we have a film like "Fair Game".

This is a film which most people have a strong opinion of. Others love it
while others hate it. What's interesting is that the reasons for the opinion
of the film are the same for both people. Others hate it because it's
unbelievably dumb, excessively violent, has an unoriginal plot, stupid
dialogue and has no good actors. However, others love it for the same
reasons. And I'm one of those people.

The film is based on Paula Gosling's novel of the same name. It's
interesting to notice that Sylvester Stallone's actioner "Cobra" was also
based on the same novel but the films have very little in common. About the
only thing they share is the hate of the critics and the love of
action-fans. What's even more interesting is that Stallone was originally
attached to this film as well.

Anyway, about this film.. While it's true that no-one has been able to make
a good macho-actioner since the 80s (except Steven Seagal and even he is now
making films like "The Patriot"), this is a quality effort if there ever was
one. This has everything I want (a macho cop as the hero, a sexy woman as
his sidekick, lots of action and gratuitous violence) and nothing I don't (a
deep and original plot, Academy Award-winning actors, emotional scenes
between mom and daughter...). Actually many scenes here are so stupid that
they could be considered campy and even if you aren't a fan of the genre,
you might enjoy laughing at the movie's unintentional humor.

One of the things which always means a lot to me in films is the score and
"Fair Game" has one of the best scores I've ever heard. I liked Mark
Mancina's score to "Speed" and "Bad Boys" but they're nothing compared to
this. A brilliant main theme combined with excellent underscore. Full
marks.

There is also the traditional "You killed my partner. Big mistake, you hear
me? Wanna know why? Because I'm gonna come and get every last one of
you!"-threat from Baldwin. I love those lines, I really do. "Cobra" was
filled with them and the  mid-80s was a good time for macho-actioners.

In fact, "Fair Game" is like a throwback to the 80s, when Joel Silver still
made good actioners (Commando, Action Jackson, Die Hard, Road House - all
brilliant). Of course it's not intelligent. Of course it's not original. Of
course it's not a film which makes people think about their lives. It is
pure action-entertainment, nothing more and nothing less. This will
definitely appeal to fans of "Cobra", "Action Jackson" and the early Steven
Seagal-films. However, if you don't like action, pure action and nothing but
the action - skip it. Even if you liked films like "Speed" and "Face/Off",
you might not like this.

Gunfights, explosions, gratuitous violence, gratuitous nudity (from Cindy
Crawford, no less!), a brilliant score..what more could a guy who loves
action ask? Definitely a 10.

Really bad and tedious with it.  The mystery here was not who was trying
to
kill Cindy Crawford, but how her hair was magically dry and sexily tousled
after a series of dunkings.

Cindy has exhibited better acting in lipstick commercials. And that scene
where she uses her charms to persuade the geek in the computer shop to
help
her was reminiscent of Ginger trying to coax a coconut from Gilligan.

Silly from start to finish.

<|_=00=_|>

Definitely not Oscar material, but a good late night watch.  Lots of
action
and stunts.  Cindy Crawford can't act, but who cares!?  The plot involves
some high tech Ruskies who are after Cindy, as F.B.I. Agent Billy Baldwin
comes to the rescue. There is ensuing sexual tension.
<|_=00=_|>
Fair Game is one of those films that teaches you things you never
realised were true until it happened on screen. Things like this:

- Explosions that blow up a mansion, and send someone flying into the
water never leave a mark on that person. But they will have blood on
their clothes, irregardless.

- Teams of expert assassins can be beaten by one cop.

- It's not humanly possible for a bad guy to kill someone without using
a one-liner first. This may explain why they don't feel any remorse.

- Cars blow up on impact, regardless of where the impact is and what
the impact is with. Unless of course our hero is in the car, in which
case, it just catches fire.

- Perfect looking fake IDs aren't necessarily done with the use of any
computers.

- Letters that look like 3s, but aren't, are found by typing in '3'
into the computer.

- Employees of small stores swear freely and loudly while on the phone
in the store.

- Continuity is not important. It can easily flow from late afternoon,
before the sun starts to set at all, to well after the sun has set, in
a matter of seconds.

- Choppers can't be heard over bad sex scene music and Cindy Crawford's
disinterested moaning.

- Cops leave the safety off when they put their gun away.

- Trained assassins watch their target do a random Baldwin brother
instead of actually doing their job.

- A bomb counts down from 2 minutes 57 seconds to 1 minute 47 seconds
in just under 15 seconds. That bomb then proceeds to blow up everything
except the room the bomb is located in.
<|_=00=_|>

The plot was stupid and the acting was so bad.  Cindy Crawford can
absolutely not act.  And the movie didn't even have any decent nude scenes.
If the people responsible for this movie are going to subject us to such
garbage they can at least throw in some decent nudity so that the movie
won't be a total loss.
<|_=00=_|>

Okay, so it's got hardly any plot and what there is doesn't make much
sense.
So it was doomed to be slated by critics the second Cindy Crawford said
yes.
So the film may have the world record for the number of scenes in the
trailer that aren't in the finished film. It's still far from the worst
film
ever made, and certainly far from the worst in the year it came out (1995
was the year of "Showgirls," "Waterworld," "Species," and "Congo" for
openers).

Way too much senseless violence, confusing scripting (from Charlie
Fletcher
and an uncredited Steven E. deSouza), and frenzied editing for sure, and
Cindy's Oscar is unlikely to be coming any time soon - but she's no worse
than the rest of the cast (and unlike Steven Berkoff, at least SHE hasn't
sunk to doing a Jean Claude Van Damme film since). She's actually pretty
good more often than not, and her punches are more convincing than some
male
actors (though hitting the smuggest of the smug Baldwin brothers provides
motivation). Let's just say that the man credited as her acting coach
clearly didn't see all his efforts go unrewarded.

And you have to give her and the rest of the cast and crew credit; no one
ever pretends that "Fair Game" is anything other than an unpretentious
action film, which can't be a bad thing. (But then even Cindy's biggest
detractors have never claimed she was pretentious.) While it is mainly for
fans of the moled one, it's still short enough not to hurt, and it
certainly
improves on the last time the Paula Gosling novel it's based on was turned
into a film (the truly awful "Cobra" with Sylvester Stallone), and you
don't
often see films starring lawyer characters doing something other than
criminal law. And before you point out that no lawyer ever looked as good
as
Cindy Crawford, remember that that never stopped Steven Bochco - or David
E.
Kelley with "Ally McBeal." Now who would you rather be represented in
court
by, Cindy or Ally?
<|_=00=_|>
Is Cindy Crawford really supposed to be staggeringly beautiful? I mean,
she's okay, with her pointy chin and beauty spot, but is she any more
attractive than, say, Madeleine Stowe, Sean Young, or Jennifer
Connolly? Crawford is taller than the others, true. She could be on an
all-girl's Olympic basketball team. But it would be hard to rank order
the beauty parade that's been on screen lately. When you get so close
to the top it becomes a matter of stylistic choice, almost arbitrary.

There's another woman in this movie, a homely middle-aged KGB agent who
demolishes men with a single kick to the head. It could be argued that
a woman with such a talent for meting out punishment might be a more
exciting date than some marshmallow ex-model.

Anyway, Crawford, the ex-model at hand, isn't bad. She has legs the
length of a giraffe's and she takes two showers at the beginning of the
movie and changes her T shirt in front of the camera once. I don't mean
to be too critical of her appearance.

It's no wonder that her bare midriff prompts the goggle-eyed Baldwin to
put a cigar in his mouth and try to light it. I take this to be
symbolism although, to be sure, "sometimes a cigar is just a cigar."
But then she cozzens some computer nerd so much that he winds up
"fiddling with my joystick." Can a joystick sometimes just be a
joystick too? Of course she can't act but we can't count that as a
demerit because nobody else in the movie can act either, so the absence
of skill on her part is hardly noticeable. Her performance though does
put on display at least one of her attractive features, in addition to
the other two, and that is an endearing lisp. "Pizza" comes out
"PEET-tha." Kind of nice. Gives her a vulnerable quality, you know?
Speaking of her vulnerability brings up the question of the plot, alas.
See -- these ex-KGB agents try to murder her in every way possible --
shooting, blowing up her house, shooting yet again, and again. Then,
towards the end, they decide she can't be killed but rather she must be
interrogated. End of discussion of plot.

I found myself wishing the heavies weren't all ex-Russian KGB agents
because the movie was shot, after all, in 1994, five years after the
collapse of the USSR, which either makes the villains out of date or
the screenwriters unimaginative in their search for heavies. Maybe
both.

It doesn't matter really, except that there are some people of an
impressionable age who might be tempted to take this cartoon as a
serious reflection of reality. Their minds might be warped enough by
exposure to these stereotypes that they grow up imagining all Russians
have faces with the general contours and texture of potatoes. The
heavies all scowl and sneer and speak with one or another foreign
accent. Was it Oliver Cromwell who said, "Take me for what I am, warts
and all"? Makeup has given the chief heavy a prominent wart right in
the middle of his forehead, like a third eye, I suppose so we don't mix
him up with the others.

These ex-Soviet Seals are something special. They are "experts in
electronics," the film tells us, but that doesn't do them justice.
Their equipment has positively supernatural attributes. For instance,
they use an infra-red heat sensor that can not only penetrate walls but
can detect that the leading lady is wearing high heels as well. And
their radio direction finder can "triangulate" a transmitter's position
all by itself.

Essentially the whole movie is one long chase. None of it makes too
much sense. After Baldwin saves Crawford's life a dozen times over she
suddenly turns on him angrily then runs away. Shortly afterward, aboard
a freight train, they have a physical fight and then she immediately
falls into his arms and they make love. Unfortunately it's one of those
love-making scenes in which such arty effects as dappled spots of blue
light move across patches of undifferentiated limbs, and it's
interrupted by one of the agents who has a laser-sight-equipped weapon
that plants a red circle on Baldwin's butt. At least Crawford notices
this. I can understand why Baldwin might not have.

There are some gags and would-be jokes and sassy lines sprinkled
through this melange of explosions and shootings and slow-motion
fireballs. It doesn't add up to much but it's so slam bang that I found
it kind of fun. I really do wish we had some generic villain for these
types of movies though. Those impressionable minds -- the ones that
can't remember the difference between Russia and the Soviet Union --
worry me at times.

I was fueling at the truck stop in Florida,chatting with the hog hauler
fueling at the pump next to me. He was telling me about the time he had
pulled off the road to take his 8 hour break,when a bunch of Russians
pulled him out of his truck at gun point. Made him open his trailer,all
the time yelling "Where are they". One had a g.p.s. locater device. He
makes his way thru the hogs and stops about half way through the
trailer. Stops ,reaches down through the hop crap, and picks up a cell
phone. Im thinking,"Some truck drivers have nothing better to do but
think up wild stories to tell his fellow truckers." Cindy
Crawford,Selma Hayek,Johann Carlo, and Jenette Goldstein are hot!!
