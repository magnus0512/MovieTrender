Many people say that "Mrs.Doubtfire" is one of the funniest movies ever
made in the U.S. I agree with the above idea for the following two
reasons. First,performance of the voice of Robin Williams is very
wonderful.For example, he uses a lot of funny ad lib in the stand-in of
animation in the first scene. Second, Robin Williams and Sally Field as
well as the three children act very delightfully though the movie deals
with a rather serious theme---warmth and importance of family. Some
people say Sally Field doesn't act well in this movie. But, I think
that she acts a role of a wife whom is worried about her husband
excelentlly. We feel big love of both father and mother toward
children. It is not only a real funny comedy but also a real wonderful
family movie.

I saw this movie at the cinema in 1993 and thought it was fantastic! It has
everything you could ever really want in a comedy. Daniel Hillard (Robin
Williams) will do ANYTHING to see his children! This movie has plenty of
gags, but it all comes together in a nice, friendly framework that centres
around one man's family and that man's love for his children that'll make
him dress up as a 60 year old granny to get back into their lives! Plenty of
laughs throughout and all-round great performances. 9/10

MRS. DOUBTFIRE is easily one of the best movies ever made. Robin Williams
makes audiences laugh and cry at his portrayal of a loving father who wants
nothing more than to be with his children. After a painful divorce, he tries
to gain custody of his children. This is the premise of the film. Along the
way, of course, there are plenty of laughs, especially some great moments
with Harvey Fierstein as Williams' brother and hair stylist. This film is so
moving that it deserves to be seen by everyone.

MRS. DOUBTFIRE (1993) ***1/2

Starring: Robin Williams, Sally Field, Mara Wilson, and Pierce Brosnan

Running time: 125 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for sexual references and some
language) 

By Blake French:

	"Mrs. Doubtfire" is one of the most invigorating, vivid character studies
to be produced on the big screen this decade. Most of the characters are
strongly executed with decisive dialogue. They are also beautifully written
with tainted personalities and uncompromising wit. Chris Columbus has
assembled a stellar dramatic comedy with excellent screen writing, giving
audiences one of the most punctually artful films I have ever
witnessed.

	The opening scene is as brilliantly structured as screen writing otherwise
comes. It has a middle-aged man named Daniel, whom we learn about as he
quits his job as a vocal performer for a children's cartoon after he
realizes his employers are immoral. This sequence provides us with a
development of the character's inner personality, strong morals and
consciences. The audience also leans that he is a silly, easy going person.
We soon find out it is these characteristics that propel the movie into the
first plot point.

	Daniel's wife, Miranda, wishes to divorce him because he is too goofy and
immature. We are propelled quickly into the firm second act after the
divorce. Before this point, we have witnessed both actions and dialogue
reallocating Daniel's love and compassion for his family, especially his
children. The film sets up the for following events using Robin Williams
character as the plot advancer.

	Daniel lusts for time with his children so much, he confidentially
disguises himself as a sixty year old woman then applies for a day-care job
for his ex-wife--this would allow him to be around his children more often.
Miranda falls for it, and the master of disguise gets his opportunity. The
film then takes us through a hilarious and emotional journey into the lives
of a typical American divorced family.

	The internal problem becomes more complex when Daniel's ex wife shows
romantic interest in a new boyfriend, underplayed by Pierce Brosnan. The
filmmakers could have done more with the Brosnan character. Here, he seems
developed with repetition and dialogue. Although his purpose is to
accommodate romantic competition, we don't know enough about him to care
that much.

	"Mrs. Doubtfire" contains some material that fairs as overly blunt and
outwardly apprehensive. Although the overall presentation is understandable
and relative, I still think the picture could have been better with more
careful script writing. Even such, we are able to witness a powerful,
touching film with a conclusion that is so settling, you will cry with
joy.

"Mrs. Doubtfire" is an extremely funny and heartfelt film. It has tons of
laughs as well as tears, this is definitly Robin Williams' best film.
Watching williams do voices as well as play Mrs. Doubtfire is a real treat.
Also the supporting cast of actors do an excellent job, I highly reccomend
it.

Many people say that Mrs Doubtfire is one of the funniest movies ever
made in the U.S. I agree with the above idea. I think Robin Williams is
one of the best comedians in the world. His performance in this movie
is perfect and gives us a lot of laugh. There are also some impressive
scenes in which performance of the three kid actors really shine.

In addition, the storyline is easy to understand and is for everybody.
It is a heart-warming movie which gives us a lot of laugh and tear.
Through this movie, we can learn the divorce situation in the U.S. We
can also recognize the importance of family bonds.

Persdonally, it is a little regrettable that the story does not have a
happy ending. I wish they could together happily again.

This is a very funny comedy but it also help us grow. I want to see
Mrs. Doubtfire repeatedly in my life.

For me, this was the funniest movie I ever saw. Not normally a huge fan
of comedy, I was just about rolling in the theatre aisles during this
gem. Robin Williams is brilliant in his 'dual role' as the rejected
husband, Daniel, and the buxom British nanny, Mrs. Doubtfire.

This movie tells the story of a bitter separation, when Miranda insists
on a divorce from her immature, goofy husband. Daniel, denied custody
and given only limited visitation, concocts a female nanny character
for himself in order to gain daily access to his three children. The
kids grow to love and depend on their unusual but very concerned and
efficient new nanny, Mrs. Doubtfire, who really gets the household
running extremely smoothly. Of course meanwhile Miranda has a new love
interest named Stu.

Williams' portrayal of Mrs. Doubtfire is hilarious in every way, shape,
and form. The wig, stockings, dress, make up...it's all too amusing,
watching Daniel transform for the part. Wait till you see Mrs.
Doubtfire cooking! The most insanely funny scene is at a restaurant
where Daniel / Mrs. Doubtfire must quickly be in two places at the same
time, so he / she is forced to alternate between personae at lightning
speed, sometimes forgetting which one he / she is at any given moment.
I won't give away the plot, but I nigh expired from laughing.

Sally Field charmingly plays Daniel's now separated wife, Miranda, and
Pierce Brosnan is suitably unsympathetic as her new love interest, Stu.
We cheer for Daniel through his assorted antics as he tries to shoo
away this romantic competitor for his ex wife's affections and
especially, this new male threatening to usurp his role as father to
his kids.

Desite being a comedy, this film does on the serious side reveal the
devastating effects of divorce on children's lives and also
particularly on the noncustodial parent. Daniel is distraught as he
misses seeing his kids every day. Furthermore, the entrance of a new
love interest naturally adds to the general strife.

Where did Mrs. Doubtfire get her unusual name? Does she live on or
fizzle out at movie's end? Will Daniel and Miranda get back together,
or will Stu prevail? I won't divulge any spoilers, but I guarantee
you'll fall in love with this lovable large nanny and wish you could
have her babysit your own kids. Mrs. Doubtfire will certainly live on
in your heart.
<|_=00=_|>

Robin Williams stars as a divorcee who decides to see his children a lot
more by posing as an elderly British woman in this smart and innovative
comedy that works because of Williams' performance more than anything
else.
Sally Field is solid as the ex-wife and Pierce Brosnan is excellent as her
new love interest. Great comedy that could be best described as a poor
man's
"Tootsie". 4 stars out of 5.

This is by far my all time favorite film. It really hits the spot with
tremendous performances by ALL cast members. The score by composer Howard
Shore gives a real warm feel to the whole duration of the movie. With the
DVD release, you get to see all the deleted scenes. In particular is a
scene
where Lydia (Lisa Jakub) is distracted during her turn in the spelling bee
by her mother and father (Sally Field, Robin Williams) who are arguing
quietly because Daniel (Williams) arrived late, and could not sit with the
family. The scene concludes with Lydia talking with her father about being
a
real family again. Lydia tells Daniel "It's your job to be our father."
Daniel replies with "No, it's a joy being your father." Scenes like these
give Mrs. Doubtfire a real sense of reality when it comes to families that
are separated by differences between the parents. It tells children that
it's okay if your parents don't get along, and are separated. It's not your
fault. Don't blame yourself. There are all sorts of different families out
there.

What really gives this movie it's unique touch is the brilliant
performances of EVERYONE in this film. I definitely recommend this film to
anyone who loves a good family film. My suggestion, get the DVD release. It
has a lot of extra features you won't get on the VHS.

Many people say that gMrs. Doubtfireh is one of the funniest movies.
I agree with the above idea. First, one of the funniest scene for me is
when Mrs. Sellner comes to Danielfs apartment and he transforms
between himself and Mrs. Doubtfire so quickly. This busy scene brings
constant laughing to us. The second funniest scene for me is when Mrs.
Doubtfire cooks the dinner for the first time and she burns her
clothes. The scene not only funny but also thrilling and my heart
fluttered with worry, too.

I know that some people claim that the storyline is too unrealistic,
but I think there are few fathers who love their children as deeply as
Daniel.

This movie is not only funny but also impressive. I rate this movie at
8/10.
