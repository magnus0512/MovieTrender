Superman 1 was such a classic movie, and 2 was almost as great - Superman 3
is not a great Superman movie, but as a piece of '80s American comedy /
spoof it succeeds and has some very memorable scenes (notably Chris Reeve as
the evil Superman). But Part 4 is just an awful film overall with few
redeeming qualities. Reeve's admirable storyline works well, and the double
date scene with Superman & Clark is very entertaining (similar to the style
of Superman III). But it's when Superman IV tries to get serious and
exciting in its action sequences that it fails miserably and becomes a
cheesey, ridiculous farce that only succeeds in showing how pointless it was
to make the film on such a small budget. The story's not bad and if Donner
was directing and you had 100 million dollars you could do it now and create
a great adventure movie with some classic comedy scenes and some exciting
action sequences. But anyway, it's too late. For all its failings, every
time you see it, it's still fairly watchable, mainly because you're always
expecting it to magically be better this time around. It's not as bad as
everyone makes out and far more creative and original on a 16 million budget
than what Batman and Robin did with 100 million! If Batman and Robin's a 3
out of 10, then Superman IV's a 6 out of 10.

Superman IV: The Quest For Peace 

Directed by: Sidney J. Furie, 1987

Perversely bad. With major budget cuts (from $28 to $16m) and story
problems, the moviemakers suddenly found themselves cutting corners in all
areas. And it shows. Completely lacking in awe, fun and excitement, Superman
IV most of all feels like a bad joke. 

The fact that it comes across more cartoonish than the previous three is
hardly intentional, as everything - from effects to dialogue - just seems
oddly rushed and second-rate.

The only highlight is Gene Hackman - who returns in high spirits as Lex
Luthor. Christopher Reeve co-scripted this time and he again personifies the
Man of Steel. But most of his co-stars are either wasted (Mariel Hemingway)
or hysterical (John Cryer). 

The new villian, Nuclear Man (as played by Mark Pillow), looks like a
Swedish showwrestler in a home-made Halloween suit, complete with mullet
hair and horrendous over-acting mannerisms. 

Director Sidney J. Furie (the man behind the otherwise taut thriller The
Entity) seems unable to create any sparks and Superman IV falls completely
flat, head first. Game over.

Note: Certain scenes had to be borrowed from the previous movies, most
notably Superman and Lois on their romantic evening flight above the
Manhattan skyline. How they even managed to make this scene look worse than
in the original is really mind-boggling.

Superman Turns "Peacenik" could be another title to this film.
Christopher Reeve remarked several times that this was his most
"important" Superman movie. Being somewhat of a Liberal "peacenik," he
was the kind you'd see out with a big "peace sign" at rallies against
nuclear weapons.This movie had the kind of message that was dear to his
heart.

Superman goes about trying to rid the world of nuclear weapons here,
especially, of course when they get into the hands of villain "Dr.
Luthor" (Gene Hackman). It was a nice message and, overall, a nice
film. Unlike the other Superman films of the era, they didn't overdo
the sappy romance with "Lois Lane" (Margot Kidder). They concentrated
more on the story. Unfortunately, that story - even with good
intentions - just wasn't all that memorable. 

Ask anyone: people remember the first two Reeve Superman films a lot
more than the last two. This one, and the third one with Richard Pryor,
pretty much "bombed" at the box office, at least compared to the
others.

It did not help that the producers of this movie were Golan-Globus
films, guys that were known for their cheap and usually-sleazy
exploitation films. "Superman" deserved better.
<|_=00=_|>
In this 4th and final Chritopher Reeve Superman film, Superman tries to
rid the world of nuclear weapons, only to find that Lex Luthor is back
and ready to supply the world with these dangerous weapons. Oh, and he
has a new sidekick: Nuclear Man! 

Many people have given this a lower rating (understandably), but a 3 or
4 out of 10? It really is not that bad. The film is fun, fast-paced and
very watchable. Some consider it the worst, but I did not find it any
better or worse than part 3. Granted, parts 1 and 2 are superior
(thanks Richard Donner) but I've seen many worse films than Superman 4.

Random thoughts: The double date scene was clever, but really annoying
and completely pointless. If Superman would just reveal himself to Lois
Lane he wouldn't have to find other girls on the side... although see
below.

The idea of getting rid of nuclear weapons was very nice and a great
social and political commentary. I agree getting rid of nuclear weapons
would be a good move. But the film made this very unrealistic. The
world cheers him on, when in reality the countries would protest. He
invades a variety of countries and steals their to secret hidden
weapons (not sure on the legality or logistics of that). And what is to
stop someone from building these weapons all over again? 

What happened to Lana Lang? At the end of part 3, it looked like
Superman finally realized that Lois Lane is a loser and hooked up with
Lana. But she is never seen or mentioned in part 4, despite working for
the Daily Planet (at least as of the last film). What gives? 

Does anyone else think Lex Luthor is getting a little tired? Did we
really need 3 films with Luthor and one with a Luthor knockoff? What
about Brainiac or Bizarro or the Eradicator or just about anyone else?
Heck, General Zod is so much cooler than Luthor (with all due respect
to Gene Hackman).

There's a scene where he rebuilds the great wall of China just by
looking at it. What power did he use? Tractor beams from his nipples?

But anyway, this film is not as bad as many would have you believe, and
if you've spent six hours on the first three, you might as well invest
90 more minutes in this series finale.

I like the idea of Superman stopping a nuclear war, however this film wasn't
that great. The problem lies with SUPERMAN tackling a "real life" problem.
Why not have Lex Luthor do something to percipitate a nuclear war and have
Superman stop it. This film was done by Cannon films, and boy did it show.
The villian with the N on his chest wasn't that great either...his only line
was "kill SUPERMAN". After the third film (which killed the francise) alot
of interest was lost. I mean who could top SUPERMAN 2? Unless they found a
new threat or villian equal to the villians in film number 2, they shouldn't
have done anymore sequels. However, this is Hollywood remember.....they
flogged this francise for every dollar it could grab, and with disasterous
results I might add.

This movie never should have been released. This movie is at the opposite
end of the spectrum as far as favorites go for me. The 1978 original is one
of my all time favorite films, while sitting through this one at the movies
was like getting a root canal without the novocain. Special effects were
horrible as well as character development and plot line. How could any
studio head or those involved with the final print of this film feel
comfortable with the finished project?

Talk about a film that rode on the popularity of its predecessors and failed
to live up to any expectations that fans of the earlier films had. This
movie certainly was the nail in the coffin as far as the Christopher Reeve
Superman films go. And for what it's worth I fall in the category that feels
Superman 3 was better than this mess. A waste of celluloid.

<|_=00=_|>

SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE pits the Man of Steel against Nuclear Man,
Lex Luther's newest creation while ridding the world of nuclear weapons. 
This is easily the worst of the SUPERMAN movies, and it was doomed to fail
right from the start.  Cut from its original 134-minute version, it is full
of plot holes resulting in a movie with some scenes that just don't make any
sense, but even with the extra 45 minutes intact, the movie still wouldn't
work because the special effects are cheap and ridiculous, and it shows. 
Unless you are a diehard fan of the Superman genre, this movie should be
avoided.

I am a huge Superman fan and I loved the first two Superman films,but
starting with the third one this franchise slowly started going
down.Now we reach the fourth installment in the franchise and not even
Superman himself could of saved this one.The story and villain were
weak and the action was boring.Plus this sported the worst special
effects in the franchise.This film feels rushed and choppy,cutting from
scene to scene leaving you confused.Christopher Reeves still played the
part perfectly,but him and Margot Kidder are the only ones.I felt
throughout the film they tried to rekindle the success of the original
two,but just couldn't do it.With a corny script,bad special effects and
action,weak acting,and terrible directing and editing this one is
completely passable.You definitely will not be watching this one again
and again like the first two.

A disappointing: 1/10!!!

Its Supes versus Nukes for the fourth, much-derided Superman adventure
often slated for its repressing low-budget, inferior special effects
and a whole wad of plot holes and incoherence Â– thanks no doubt to the
extraction of a whole fifty minutes, much of the film's middle portion.
Yet, among the wreckage are signs that there was a good film in here
somewhere, as our hero struggles to decide whether or not to intervene
in human history and the character's rather touching realisation that
he is not just a visitor to Earth. A nicely-toned return to the
Lois-Clark-Superman relationship also could have rooted the film back
to its glorious predecessors - bar number three - but once Nuclear Man
shows up and the film's story is cut in half, all promise and potential
disappears from the project and the audience is left with a strictly
mediocre re-tread of Superman II.

Despite its reputation as the worst of the Superman movies, Superman
IV: The Quest For Peace is not. Despite the horrendous special effects
and rushed ending, the film manages to still present itself with some
respect.

Christopher Reeves had proved in the three previous films his ability
to convincingly play the role of Superman. With this film, he not only
proves his abilities but this is, in many respects, his best
performance in the role. His speeches during the film are a sign of
this and his chemistry with all the other actors helps also. Reeves
also does his best to sell the special effects sequences it is a shame
he couldn't. Reeves is the films biggest saving grace and it's a shame
this would be his last time in the role.

Gene Hackman also returns in the role of Lex Luthor and with brings him
that character's with, charm, and silent menace. But somehow he seems
to be out of place most of the time and serves as a drawback in many of
his scenes. Mark McClure, Jackie Cooper and Margot Kidder all return in
their roles. But unfortunately they are all under used and their
appearances might as well be cameos.

The rest of the cast does a decent job. Mark Pillow does excellent in
the role of Nuclear Man, Luthor's super powered creation. Pillow does
the role so well that one wonders how much better eh might have been in
the special effects had been better. Mariel Hemingway is a welcomed
addition to the cast as a heiress who serves as an additional love
interest for Clark Kent. The only major addition that doesn't fit is
Jon Cryer who could easily be the single most annoying character to
ever appear in a Superman movie.

The film's real drawback is its low budget values. While this doesn't
affect the majority of sets, the Fortress of Solitude set in particular
looks cheap when compared to the one found in previous films. The same
can also be said of the Daily Planet set. The low budget would also
hurt the film in the area a budget was needed most: special effects.

The previous films, for all their flaws, at least had decent special
effects and mostly convincing flying sequences and this film has
neither. The special effects are sub-par by virtually any standard and
despite being made nearly a decade after the first movie the effects
from the first movie are still more convincing. The truly horrific
nature of this films effect sequences can be seen during the climactic
battles between Superman and Nuclear Man. The added addition of new
powers with bad special effects doesn't help either.

The other major problem is the pacing of the film. The first 50 minutes
or so is sheer entertainment that's the set up the story of both
Superman riding the world of nukes and Luthor's evil plan. The set up,
however, is better then the execution of the ending, which is both
rushed and disjointed. The subplots of Mariel Hemingway's character and
the boy who inspired Superman's quest are both left unfinished for
example. Whole scenes feel incomplete and the final battle is over far
too quickly to be effective.

But the film does have a saving grace in its concept. The idea of
taking Superman, the ultimate hero of America, and placing him into the
timely situation of Cold War disarmament is a stroke of utter
brilliance. The concept of Luthor and Nuclear Man added to it also
serve as an interesting addition to the story and it makes for good
entertainment when viewed in this context. But this concept is ruined
by the rushed feeling of the ending. But one still has to give high
marks to Christopher Reeves and the screenwriters for their concept.

The films does have another saving grace: its musical score. Like the
Ken Thorne scores for II and III, Alexander Courage's score makes heavy
use of the John Williams themes composed for the first film and is
highly effective. The Courage adaptation never fails to use the
Williams music to maximum effect and it's a shame that, at Courage's
own request, it has yet to see release.

Despite its flaws in special effects and editing, Superman IV has
saving graces in Christopher Reeves, the rest of the cast, the music,
and the timely nature of the story. While nowhere near as good as
Superman The Movie or Superman II and while not as bad as Superman III,
the film still serves its purpose and is your average Superman
adventure.
