The movie is about a movie writer who is expected to have a script
delivered. But he couldn't manage to write one.Falls in love in the
process and writes his own story instead.

The final scene is to be predicted even after you read the title.
"Patron Mutlu Son Ä°stiyor" meaning "Boss wants a happy ending", but
still the final is cherished and romantic. 

Side characters are well scripted and merged into story very well.

I am not sure what people expects from a romantic comedy , but it was a
very good one indeed. 

Lots of laughter , a good plot and very good acting.
