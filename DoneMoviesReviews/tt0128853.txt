I've been starved for a great romantic film and YOU'VE GOT MAIL more than
sated my appetite! I'd rank it right up there with CASABLANCA as one of the
most romantic movies of all time.  Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have more
chemistry than a High School Science Department!   This movie was warm,
funny, smart, and sexy.  Tom and Meg light up the screen and Tom Hanks is
the perfect hero!  The movie was 2 hours long, felt like 10 minutes, and I
didn't want it to be over!  This is a definite keeper, and I can't wait for
it to come out on video so I can watch it again and again!

I'm from Germany and I love this film! It makes me happy to just watch
it! When watching this film one comes to think why in real life such
beauty in words and moments can't be achieved! The film does'nt get
boring, even if watched for the 23rd time! It's pure magic - you could
endlessly listen to the conversations, the beautiful music and enjoy
the excellent acting! Other films try to come in too trendy with freaky
music and sexual content(not that there's anything wrong with that) -
but it's not a feelgood movie! Besides the puns and the lovely warm
hearted atmosphere does the rest! To everyone who hasn't yet seen this
movie - rent it, buy it - enjoy it!

This movie was so much better than I expected, which was a simple romantic
comedy with predictable "pass each other in the street" scenarios
throughout.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a love story that touched my
heart.  Kathleen's vulnerability and pride in her mother made me cry and
Joe's sensitivity and devious behavior were so very sweet.

I didn't think that Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan could pull off a romance better
than they did in Sleepless In Seattle but I am happy to be
mistaken.

Romantic comedies are not everyone's cup of tea; after all, who would want
to watch unrealistic stories about ordinary people 'coupling' when we are
offered such wonderful everyday experiences as ten car pileups, hordes of
people being slaughtered in a hail of bullets while shopping, goblins,
explosions, vampires and intergalactic spaceships?

But the majority of women, and many of those men who do not see themselves
as the Governor of California will surely find much to like in this charming
eye-moistener.

Tales of this ilk can easily be mawkish, but this one largely avoids the
trap, thanks to an intelligent script, the believability of the lead pair
(as well as the supporting cast) and good pacing that leaves the denouement
until the closing shot.

In films like You've Got Mail, where you can almost predict how it's going
to turn out as soon as the opening credits appear, then it is up to the
writers, director, and actors, to get us to enjoy the journey to the end
credits. Nora and Delia Ephron's script succeeds because they know their
characters well, and give them a can't miss plot device.  Tom Hanks is
believable as the head of a gigantic bookstore chain, as is Meg Ryan as
the
owner of a small children's bookstore shop.  As the guy who is putting Meg
out of business by opening a chain store close to her little shop, Tom
Hanks
character comes across as the arrogant person who only goal seems to open
as
many bookstores as he can, and make as much money as he can in doing so.
When he is talking to Meg Ryan on the internet, we see another side of
him,
and learn that possibly, he's not the evil guy you think he is.  Of
course,
in person, Meg hates him for what he is doing, on the internet, she falls
in
love with him.  This is what makes the film work, as their reaction to
each
other in person is completely different from when they talk on line.  Some
people may quibble that the ending is not very believable, but face it, do
you fall in love with a person because of who they are, or what you think
they are?  I think this question is answered quite adequately.

I was pleasantly surprised to find "Mail" not to be a rehash of "Sleepless."
Ryan and Hanks do work exceptionally well together! Three-quarters into the
movie I was wondering how they would ever pull off a romantic and yet
believable ending, but the scene at the garden was one of those perfect
moments in filmmaking. It just rang true and consistent with the story.

I really enjoyed this one! (And hearing Harry Nilsson's music again, used so
beautifully, was icing on the cake!)

...except for the fact that this movie made me so happy! I'm a huge Tom
Hanks fan and I collect all of his movies, and it has been quite some
time since i've seen a really good and special movie of his. He's just
such a wonderful actor and Meg Ryan's just... Well, she's just so
great, always happy and when she's acting she always makes me laugh,
cause she's just so wonderful! Let's talk about this movie: I'm gonna
be honest with you, this isn't Forrest Gump or The Green Mile, but it
is romantic, special, wonderful and it made me smile and wish for them
to get together in the film, and in the end I was just happier then
before! I think it's underrated, but everyone has a special taste, and
I just loved it! I seriously recommend it to every Tom Hanks and Meg
Ryan fan, you are not going to regret it! Thank you for your time.

Pleasant, undemanding fluff reworks 1940's "The Shop Around the Corner"
(remade initially in 1949 as the musical "In The Good Old Summertime")
and reteams Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan for the second time in genial plot
about rival bookstore owners. She operates a Mom & Pop bookshop, he's
opening another outlet in his retail chain nearby; they lock horns over
business, yet are unaware they are also each other's internet pen-pal.
Slick and occasionally too-cute, but very entertaining picture with a
holiday theme. Ryan is delightful, Hanks less so (he's rote, and looks
tired to boot), but Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Jean Stapleton and
Steve Zahn make up a terrific supporting cast. Engaging and lots of
fun. *** from ****

It was hard not to give this movie a 10, but since I have only given out
about 20 10's in all the movies I have ever seen - thousands, a 10 here
would have been a little too generous.

Though, it is difficult to find fault, I suppose it is fair to say that the
movie didn't always have full steam - especially early on. Still, even
during those times, it was interesting. I mean, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. What
else do you need?

Additionally, I didn't laugh very much. Not that I was required to, but this
genre would, after all,  be considered a romantic comedy. Despite the lack of
laughs, it was as feel good as it gets.

The movie was blessed with two great actors, a creative idea, excellent
writing and directing. And, the ending was one for the ages. I might have
chosen to "tweak" it a little, but it was about as good as you will ever see
- assuming you like romance. I do!

I'm not usually drawn to the stereotypical "cute chick flick," but while
You've Got Mail unabashedly falls into this category, I still loved
it.
Mail is a clever story, cleverly acted by Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.  I
enjoyed it more than their last joint project, Sleepless in Seattle simply
because the immensely likeable pair were onscreen together so much more.
Some will dub the movie predictable and sappy, but hey, I wasn't looking
for
deep psychology, just a friendly feel good.  If that's what you're after,
Mail delivers.
Hanks and Ryan have the greatest onscreen chemistry I've seen, and the last
half hour of the film is right on target.  While the happy ending was
inevitable, I was curious to discover exactly how it would occur.
Sugar-coated it was, but charming and thoroughly enjoyable!!!
A few bits of dialogue were a little too cute for my taste, but overall,
You've Got Mail is more sweet than sugary.
