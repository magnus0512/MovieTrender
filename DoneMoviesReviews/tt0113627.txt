If Mike Figgis never made another film, and Nick Cage and Elizabeth
Shue retired after making Leaving Las Vegas, they would have done so
with impunity. Both actors are superb, and bring the excellent
screenplay to life with the help of some masterful dramatic
cinematography.

Cage plays a suicidal alcoholic who has come to Las Vegas to drink
himself to death, and Shue plays the unexpected problem - a prostitute
who falls in love with him. The only reason this film did not receive a
ten from me is the voice-over technique which was tastefully minimal,
but, in my opinion, the only mistake the director made. It does help to
provide closure, but I felt that closure was an unnecessary compromise
here.

This is not an entertaining film, and in truth, I am surprised by its
popularity among typical audiences. It is a serious film, and a work of
art, but fun is not to be found here. DO NOT see this film if you
dislike feeling emotionally drained and ethically challenged, and DO
NOT see it if you are very prone to boredom, or easily offended by
sexual violence, substance abuse and the horror of daily life on the
street. 

This is an intensely sad film about love shared by people who are
caught in the gravity of their lives and can not escape. It is also a
story of redemption and respect, found in improbable places. It is NOT
a fun-filled frolicking romantic comedy, but rather, the opposite, and
it achieves a beauty, dignity and power almost unique among films
treating such starkly real and disturbing subjects.

Remarkable. Touching. Riveting. Leaving Las Vegas is all of these and
then some. I have not seen a film of this magnitude about loneliness
and acceptance in such a while that I was in tears for much of the run
time.

Nicholas Cage is Ben, a man who has lost his wife and child, throws his
job away, and takes all of his remaining money to buy as much liquor as
possible and "drink himself to death" in the city of Las Vegas. He has
given up all hope, with no wish to live, but for one reason or another,
wants a companion to share in his misery, but not try to save him. He
finds this companion in a hooker, Sera, played by Elizabeth Shue. They
immediately form a strong relationship based on one night of talking
about their lives. Sera in particular quickly grows attached to Ben,
for no other reason than she has been alone her whole life and wants
nothing more than to feel that want and need by someone.

Cage won his first Oscar for his role as Ben, and how deserved it was.
He was astounding, perfection, down to every single tick, the volume of
his voice, the pain and tragedy buried in his eyes. I could not believe
the extent of his role, the dedication and time he invested in bringing
this character to life. Same goes for Elizabeth Shue, who with a simple
glance at a person, she reveals her entire self, and no one even dares
to notice except for Ben. This neediness is apparent, she wants to hold
onto this relationship so badly, yet what makes their relationship work
is total and complete acceptance of their respective decisions. He will
not tell her to stop being a hooker, and she in return can never ask
him to stop drinking. And it is in that factor that makes this film
worth watching. To be totally accepted by those around them, to open
themselves up to such an extreme.

Leaving Las Vegas is a sobering film about connections, loneliness,
acceptance, and a small little island of hope that is Ben and Sera.
They are two good people, depicted in a world full of sorrows and
misdeeds, who latch onto each other and never let go. They were nothing
but ghosts, till that chance encounter, and became each others worlds.
Cage and Shue bring these good people to life in such an extraordinary
way, making Leaving Las Vegas a film to be treasured and remembered for
years to come. I highly recommend this film.
<|_=00=_|>

It's not a movie I could bear to watch very often, because it's sad to see
people destroy themselves. But Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue are
riveting
to watch here. As a person who has a past involvement in alcohol and
substance abuse, I found Cage's performance especially compelling, and
after
watching him in this one, I am sure glad that lifestyle is behind
me!

The chemistry between these two is really great, two people that need each
other in different ways, trying to cope with how screwed up their lives
have
become. Very real performances, if you're faint-of-heart be ready for some
strong words, and not just obscenities. Wow! They really lay it on the
line.
Great performances by two of my favorites.

I've seen this film 5 or 6 times. It occurred to me on the last viewing
that it could be the ultimate Touched by an Angel  Ben's time in Las
Vegas, that is. I believe author John O'Brien thought he was living
through a hallucination in the final throes of his diseased life.

The possibility rises out of several conspicuous dynamics in the film.

First, that Ben's life was invested developing Hollywood drama prior to
being dismissed by his boss, who will clearly miss his talent and
personality in the office, a talent singularly broken by the ravages of
alcoholism. He is good at inventing and developing "story". If his
occupation had been Investment Banking or Teaching, I'd feel
differently. But John O'Brien bore him with a Hollywood mind. That lit
the flame for me.

That Ben repeatedly calls Sera his angel during his demise - as he
enjoys the best of - and endures the worst of - Las Vegas living. It is
possible that all of it is a hallucination during the final pathetic
act of his life. The invention of Sera makes his passing bearable,
doable, a possible goal for him.

That Sera endures the college team horrors, discuses her relationship
with the off-camera therapist to whom she confesses her soul-deep love
for Ben ... even the problems with her pimp and landlord constitute
deep back story in the mind of a man with a talent for such invention,
desperate to flesh out the reasons why this angel will escort him to
the next world. In my last analysis, she is an angel divined in his
fertile mind to embody all of the good people and events in his life
(the wealth flashback memories, e.g.). Sera has come to take him out
while steeling the love in his heart. She sees him for what he is,
because that's what responsible angels do.

This is a work with metaphor far beyond the veneer of the surface
dialog. It's a film demanding to be viewed more than once. Or perhaps,
I'm just going nuts, have lost it and I'm hallucinating in my own
right.

Either way, enjoy. 10 out of 10.

Mike Figgis directed beautifully 'Leaving Las Vegas'... His film
resulted audacious, fiercely realistic... 

Hollywood had great success with movies about alcoholism: "The Lost
Weekend" which won four Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Ray
Milland and "Days of Wine and Roses," depicting Jack Lemmon as a
charming drunk who loses his job because of this, and brings his wife
(Lee Remick) down with him...

In 'Leaving Las Vegas,' Figgis captures the chaos inside an alcoholic
divorcée... He shows the complexity of life and human relationships...
He invites us to use our imaginations about a suicidal alcoholic... He
never really explained how his character is bent on killing himself,
nevertheless his powerful message remains a very sad one, extremely
difficult to embrace... The final scene in a dark, filthy motel room
rank as some of the most heartbreaking moments I have ever seen in
film, and surely it will leave you terribly moved... 

Figgis treats his two leading characters tenderly... He never makes
moral pronouncements, and to his credit, the film remains honest to the
end, never sinking into sentimentality...

His style as his story remembers me Marco Ferreri's greatest
international success, 'La Grande Bouffe' (Blow-Out), a black and
highly flatulent comedy (that won the Grand Jury prize at the Cannes
Film Festival in 1973) about four middle-aged men who gather in a
well-appointed villa to eat themselves to death...

'Leaving Las Vegas' is the depressing love story of a failed drunken
writer and a self-assured $500-a-night young hooker with whom he
crosses paths... It is an appeasing tale of a dedicated drunk who downs
entire bottles of hard liquor in several gulps... He is on the way down
and he recognizes it... He is an ecumenical drinker who wants to
destroy everything that remains of his old life... He fills his
supermarket jumbo cart with as much booze as possible, and moves for
Vegas to literally drink himself to death... 

Nicolas Cage is remarkable as Ben Sanderson, the alcoholic who is
resolute and actually thoughtful about his self-destruction..

Ben admits he has nothing to live for and he wants to die... He swills
vodka from the bottle in the shower... He drinks greedily at the bottom
of a swimming pool... He drinks, and drinks, 'til there's no more...
And when he discovers that the Casino does not offer the Bloody Mary's
that he asks, he explodes, overturning the table of Blackjack where he
was gambling... He wakes up at night shaking so much he can merely
crawl to the refrigerator and intensely swallows Vodka mixed with a
little orange juice... 

Elisabeth Shue proves to be a revelation as Sera.. A polite, beautiful,
and sensitive blonde woman who prides herself on being just a
high-class call girl... Nevertheless her vulnerable character is very
puzzling for her terrible lifestyle, and her strange desperate
attachment to a sadistic pimp Yuri Butso... 

Sera meets Ben and inexplicably finds herself attracted to him... She
soon develop a rich closeness that can nearly be described as love...
Ben continues to tell her that true love between them could never
happen... 

After Yuri is soon out of the way by Russian thugs, she takes Ben under
her wing, and attempts to fill a need in her life much like Ben fills
his needs with liquor... Both share a common bond of misery and
loneliness... Sera cares for Ben enough to handle his drunken bouts of
coldness... She complies to Ben's own terms and vows to never dissuade
him from his suicidal goal... Out of sheer love, she even buys him a
silver flask for a present, while, inside, she is desperate to find
some way to change his course as well as her own... 

In one of the most revealing scenes at a desert resort, she drowns
herself in sunlight and liquor to seduce Ben... She tries to love him,
and in his infrequent getaways of semi-sobriety, he attempts to love
her back... 

The opportunity is shattered as Ben, without an ability or desire to
change, becomes for her a tragic portrait of life without hope... How
foolish of her to push him to select...

Shue keeps, all the way, an intriguing character extremely human... She
is good and tender... Never tough or cynical... Her observations,
without dialog, suggest just a sliver of expectation... In the final
outcome, this dream hooker is the heart of the story... The Academy
showed their appreciation by giving her a best actress nomination...

"Leaving Las Vegas" is pain, isolation and honesty... An unusual
picture of human desperation and impotency... A study of acceptance,
resignation and despair of an amazing two characters... An examination
of what happens when two lovers are caught in cycles of
self-destruction... 

The film is extremely well written, directed and acted... The chemistry
between Cage and Shue is sizzling... They are able to solve their
existential frustrations by connecting in perfect harmony, and yet they
are still completely alone... 

'Leaving Las Vegas' has some film noir feel by moments, specially
during the dark alleyways and hookers, where its neon signs are seedy,
its nights perpetual, and the glitter absent... Figgis' camera moves as
fluidly as the alcohol guzzles bottle after bottle down Cage's
throat... The music adds plenty to the motion picture with ballads
playing a large role in the odd romance... Like Chaplin and Woody
Allen, Figgis molds his movie by using his own music...

In an ironic twist of events, the book's author John O'Brien actually
committed suicide in 1994, two weeks after selling the movie rights...
He never got to see his vision realized on the screen... Director, Mike
Figgis finished the film as a tribute...
<|_=00=_|>
To me, this is one of the best romantic films that you can get your
hands on. If you are interested in seeing a pure love, one that is not
focused purely on sex, but instead emotional and mental connectiveness,
then this is the film for you. While others will argue that this is not
the best date film, I would beg to differ. Leaving Las Vegas would be a
perfect choice for a first date film over anything that Meg Ryan or the
recycle bin of Hollywood has to offer. It is a gripping story of
realistic love, and the dramatic consequences of giving your heart to
someone. It is about dreams, companionship, and the hurdles of everyday
romance. This is a film that proves that the darker underbelly of our
society still has a shimmering light of hope and love. Director Mike
Figgis has done an outstanding job of giving these two rich characters
the right elements to build upon the "classic" love-story moments,
while giving it a flavor uniquely his own. Figgis' mixture of gritty
Vegas with the beautiful jazz sounds really created the ambiance of
love and pushed these two ugly ducklings closer towards their
transformation into love. I think that is what really captured me on
this film, was that it was similar to the love stories that Hollywood
continually releases, except it gave us two tragic characters instead
of these bubbly, money isn't everything, characters that seem to be
repetitive cogs in the Hollywood machine.

Let me explain this further. When you think of a love story, what are
the elements that you consider? You have a guy and a girl (normally),
they have this coincidental moment where they find their common bond,
they are held back by either an internal or external dilemma, there is
a factor of insecurity, and finally the dramatic ending where the two
rush together at a predisclosed location (normally an airport). Does
that sound familiar in any way? These are all elements that you can
find in LLV. I have seen this film at least a dozen times, and for some
odd reason it was this viewing that it just seemed to click for me.
This is the perfect American love story told with a darker tone. While
most will see this as nothing more than the story of a drunk trying to
kill himself and a graphic scenes with a prostitute, I saw it as the
classic story of love. All the elements are present. Ben and Sera
coincidentally meet one night, both seeking companionship and without
the pressures of sex, they immediately form this bond that will never
be broken. Through Ben's drunkenness, he remembers her and continually
wants to see her. They both have internal factors that hold them back,
Sera's is prostitution while Ben's is his drinking. Even through there
are these factors, they still find themselves together. That feeling of
insecurity is even there when Sera arrives home one night to find Ben
with someone else. It all seems to fit. Then there is the amazing
ending that will either have you in rapture or in awe. These two are in
love, and it isn't this bubbly love between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, it
is truths of America finding the dream of compassion.

The only unnecessary moments that I felt could have been fine-tuned
were those involving Julian Sans. I just couldn't capture his
character. I needed a bit more back-story or perhaps more interactions
between him and Sera. Something was missing that distracted from the
scenes that they shared. Outside of this one element, the rest of the
film was purely flawless and even at times carnal. For example, when
Sera has the opportunity to be on her own, she chooses to forgo her
independence and be with Ben. Shue and Figgis both demonstrate that
perhaps Sera is not in love with Ben, but instead the concept of a man
wanting to be with her because of who she is. It is obvious that Sera
seeks companionship, and probably has never had it all her life, when
suddenly Ben struts into the picture. This may explain why she
continues to work when she doesn't have to. She is used to the job, she
thrives for the intensity, and perhaps uses it to fall deeper in love
with Ben. Figgis doesn't come out and give you a reason why Sera
continues along her path, but instead leaves it up to your imagination
and enjoyment. Leaving Las Vegas felt like a combination Breaking the
Waves, Love Liza, and All the Real Girls. This is a love story with so
many different human elements coming to you at once that the average
viewer would probably ignore the signs and see this as a depressing
film. While it isn't the lightest film of the ages, it does prove that
"Love is a very splendid thing".

I cannot end this review without at least mentioning the amazing acting
done by both Nicolas Cage and Elizabeth Shue. The chemistry between
them is rare in Hollywood. I felt that these two really made this film
and were just not placed in their roles to sell tickets. Cage really
felt comfortable and understood his character while Shue fit perfectly
with her secrets and heart. It is obvious why Cage won the Oscar for
his role in this film, and while I am sure we will never see him take a
role like this again (thanks to summer blockbusters), it was good to
see him take a role that really redefined the romance genre. The same
goes for Shue. While she hasn't really made another film like this one
in a very long time (outside of Adventures in Babysitting), it is good
to know that she can take on roles like this and have the guts to
follow through.

Overall, this was a very powerful and emotional film for me.

Grade: ***** out of *****
<|_=00=_|>

Not unlike John Huston's Under The Volcano, Leaving Las Vegas borrows from
Greek mythology, obliquely mirroring the tragedy and pathos of Orpheus'
failed attempt to rescue his dead wife, Eurydice, from Hades. Mike Figgis
obliges us with a helpful hint in the scene where Nicolas Cage gives
Elizabeth Shue a present of earrings: Greek cameos.

As in the ancient tale, love challenges the inevitability of death,
although, in the case of LLV, roles are upended and sometimes blurred, and
Orphean references are either thinly disguised, or non-specific to the
point
of being thoroughly sublimated. Academic, to be sure, but completely
acceptable as long as LLV can sustain itself and remain engaging. And it
surely does, thanks to Figgis' intelligent script and direction, Cage's
role
as a down-and-out writer and his protracted self-destruction, and Shue's
portrayal of a lonely hooker, lifting that old bromide beyond what could
have been routine, to a level not seen since Jane Fonda's character in
Klute. Excellent performances all around.

With all that said, this film is not for everyone (in particular those who
only respond to gratuitous sex, car chases, and mindless pyrotechnics).
The
lurid depictions of despair, self-loathing, and violence could put off
even
the most hardened social worker. In my mind's eye, I could see
psychiatrists
amongst the theater audiences, furiously jotting down their observations.
Understandable; the two principal characters are, in the common parlance,
screwed up. One cannot cope with failure, so decides to opt out, while the
other does cope, but only barely, existing along the ragged edges of what
passes for society in Nevada Hell. These details, though, tend to outline
and, indeed, strengthen the true heart of this film: Sacrifice and
Unconditional Love.

If this film is not for everyone, then who is it for? Those with real life
experience and the maturity gained thereby. Those with strong emotional
constitutions. Anyone appreciative of impassioned performances. Freudians.
Alcoholics, recovering and otherwise. Pimps. Priests. Classicists. Petty
whiners in need of perspective. And, more than anyone else, couples who
plan
on breaking up. In sickness and in health, 'til death do us part. 9.5 out
of
10.

"Leaving Las Vegas" is an insightful, harrowing experience about the
binding forces of true romance, the power of encouragement and
compassion, and the tragic effects of alcoholism. The performances are
absolutely astounding: Nicholas Cage delivers one of the most
unforgettable, genuine, and human performances ever captured on film (a
well-deserved Oscar for every reason), and Elisabeth Shue, as his soul
provider and protector through the trauma of his alcoholic turmoil is
sentimental, passionate, and definitely deserving of the Oscar for Best
Actress in 1995, providing us with the eye of Ben Sanderson's heart and
soul, as his equally troubled lover who has pledged to stay with him
through tears and trials. Director Mike Figgis is intensely effective
in following the many turmoils of Sanderson as he copes with terminal
alcoholism, even going so far as to declaring he will "drink himself to
death in Las Vegas", and the effects of his struggle upon his
functions, health, and spirit, as well as the corresponding attributes
of his loyal lover, Sara. I'm certain that anyone who has experienced
the turmoil of alcoholism or has been deeply involved with such an
abuser will gravely appreciate the realism and depth of this film to
address the egregious effects of drinking constantly, and how this
alcoholism tears many lives literally apart. I was horrified by
Sanderson's dependence upon alcoholism as a substitute for happiness
and control, and Nicholas Cage's uncanny human performance, with all of
his appropriate, convincing twitches and erratic movements, enhanced
the compassion and torment I felt for this character, who has literally
surrendered his life to this terrible disease of alcoholism. We gasp in
horror as we see Sanderson taking a shower with a bottle of gin in
hand, and trembling to the refrigerator for a bottle of vodka: these
are the true, tragic symptoms of alcoholism, and this film does an
excellent job in addressing them. A brilliant, tragic, yet extremely
essential study of the disease of alcoholism and how it can destroy
every aspiration, every desire, and every state of consciousness we
have within ourselves, when we are constantly craving "one more bottle
of vodka" 24 hours a day, 7 days a week... Nicholas Cage delivers one
of the most heartfelt and eerily convincing performances in the history
of film, and this is one lamentable, subliminal look at one of the
saddest and unnecessary addictions in humans: striving to either
enhance, better, or in this case, destroy their lives in constantly
drinking intoxicating and deadly substances. Sanderson to Sara: "You
can never make me stop drinking"--- the sad, yet frighteningly real
state of mind of a disparaged, hopeless, alcoholic. **** out of ****
<|_=00=_|>
Ben Sanderson is an alcoholic, who after getting released from his well
paid screen writing position, heads to Vegas with his severance pay.
Where he seriously plans to drink himself to death. But whilst cruising
down the strip he meets Sera, a nicely turned out prostitute, and both
troubled souls come together in an unlikely romance. 

Based around the semi-autobiographical novel by John O'Brien, an
alcoholic who committed suicide before the film made it to the screen,
this is a sad, dark and deeply upsetting picture. Sanderson and his
plight has no motive, we are not fed reasons for his nihilistic
behaviour. We find him at the beginning of the film joyously hurtling
thru a liquor market isle, promptly filling his shopping cart with
bottles of liquor. From here on in we know that this is no ordinary
film about an alcoholic trying to get off the booze, we are on a train
to Bleakville, stops at Love and Liberation seem a very long way away. 

Enter Sera, the sweet and wholesome prostitute, who having escaped the
abusive and borderline psycho pimp, Yuri, is herself in need of
liberation. But can she carry the burden of both as this unlikely and
almost certainly doomed romance starts to become significant? Nicholas
Cage as Sanderson is terrific, very compelling, realistic and segueing
from zany wired comedy to the desolation of Sanderson's death wish
descent within a heart beat. Elisabeth Shue as Sera is also incredibly
potent, if perhaps guilty of looking too pristine, and prompting
questions of why she would be drawn to Ben's world anyway? 

Shue none the less works her socks off to make Sera sensitive and
believable. Directed by Mike Figgis, who shot it beautifully in Super
16 film, the film won a Best Actor Academy Award for Cage, and garnered
nominations for Best Actress {Shue} & Best Director and Best Adapted
Screenplay {both Figgis}. Massively popular and praised on release, it
has lost none of the impact that it had back then. 8/10

I remember seeing this film when it came out, not really knowing what
to expect. the only thing i knew about the film was that Nicolas Cage
was in it. i saw it with my girlfriend and i remember that throughout
the movie nobody made a sound, no annoying popcorn munchers, no one
getting up to go to the toilet, just complete silence. And after the
film was finished and the credits were rolling across the screen people
still sat quiet in their seats. The film is beautifully played and
directed. The sober jazz music from sting fits like a glove. To this
day my girlfriend want let me see leaving las Vegas again because i get
mellow and "preoccupied" for several days.
