Well, having not only spent two years on the shelf but getting released
straight to video AND the original studio - Universal - disowning it
(removing its logo and "Universal presents..." as well as giving it to
another studio to release on DVD and video) I was expecting yet another
Stallone bomb. Actually, while I would never say it's a good movie, it
nowhere as bad as you might think - it's certainly better than recent
Stallone turkeys like GET CARTER.

It's actually starts surprisingly well. Not only is Stallone's character
given a lot of dialogue, Stallone actually *acts* when delivering it. The
subsequent events that traumatize his character are well done, with a
genuine eerieness to them. Things continue well for a while longer, showing
the utter pit of despair Stallone's character has fallen in, and Stallone
once again is up to this challenge.

Then he goes to the detox center, and the movie quickly falls apart. The
biggest problems are:

(1) WAY too many characters. It was extremely difficult to remember who was
who with all these people walking in and out of the camera. It's also
difficult to separate each person in your mind because we hardly learn a
thing about each character - if we are lucky.

(2) REALLY bad editing. Scenes (and some individual cuts) go by so quickly
that we often don't get the chance to properly digest what we're given to
ponder. Two things happening at the same time (in different places) are cut
back and forth with no seeming purpose, and no coherent flow. Though the DVD
has eight deleted scenes, it's obvious that there was originally a lot more
shot. I have to agree with another poster that there are signs there was a
desperate effort to save the movie in the editing room.

(3) Once in the detox center, poor Stallone has almost NOTHING to do. He's
given almost nothing to say, and frequently sits on the sidelines while
things are happening. Not exactly a star vehicle, this
movie.

Still, there is a good amount of atmosphere, the movie is briskly paced
(though sometimes incoherent because of this), and the sets/production
values are pretty decent. While I wouldn't have recommended anyone to see it
at a theater if it had gotten released there, you have to remember there
have been far worse films (with and without Stallone) that did get such
releases.

We all remember him as ''ROCKY'' or ''RAMBO'' it's unfortunately sad
that the critics won't agree when sly does anything outside the
''ACTION'' genre....anyway the movie is the kind that you would watch
with you're girlfriend or a loved someone on a rainy night...

Troubled ''ex'' cops are in a D-TOX center ..something goes wrong when
they start winding up dead...its up too stallone to catch the killer..

Sylvester stallone is good as the main character, Robert patrick ( the
guy in the terminator and the x files series ) is really good and gives
a 10-10 In his performance in this movie..without giving away anything
else..., its a good movie. and stallone just like in the last decade is
very very underrated, he CAN act!

 The real mystery of D-Tox (hereinafter referred to by its video tile, "Eye
See You") is why it never found a distributor in North America. I thought it
was a good movie. You have to give star Sylvester Stallone a little credit
for trying to shed his Rambo he-man image and playing a distraught and
tragic hero.

 The story involves a serial killer who has been murdering cops and whose
murders will be investigated by FBI agent Jake Malloy (Stallone). When the
killer murders Malloy's girlfriend Mary (Dina Meyer) he goes into a funk and
finds solace at the bottom of a bottle to the point of contemplating
suicide. Malloy's friend and partner Hendricks (Charles S. Dutton) convinces
him to go to an isolated D-Tox center in Wyoming run by shrink Kris
Kristofferson.

 Malloy is thrown in with other cops from various locations who also have
demons to exorcise. Among them are Christopher Fulford as Slater who tries
to befriend him, Noah (Robert Patrick) who has a chip on his shoulder,
McKenzie (Robert Prosky), Jones (Courtney B. Vance), Brandon (Mif) and Lopez
(Angela Alvarado) among others. Polly Walker plays Jenny a sympathetic nurse
and Tom Berenger and Stephen Lang as two suspicious workers at the
facility.

 It turns out that the serial killer that Malloy thought he had killed
earlier, has in fact infiltrated the D-Tox Center and has begun
systematically murdering the people there. But who is he or
she?

 Director Jim Gillespie gives us a murder mystery rather than an action
film. It has the isolation and claustrophobic feeling reminiscent of John
Carpenter's "The Thing" (1982) except in this case the killer is human and
not alien.

 Stallone is good in the lead role experiencing a wide range of emotions.
Its one of his better performances in recent years. Of the supporting
players, Patrick stands out as well as Fulford, Dutton, Prosky, Vance,
Alvartado and Lang. Berenger hardly has anything meaningful to do and is
wasted here. And watch for Ron Howard's dad Rance Howard as the proprietor
of the lodge that Dutton stays at.
 
 "Eye See You" is an under appreciated film and deserves a chance to find an
audience. It is hoped that the video release will give it proper visibility.

I just watched a screener copy of this movie.  I was thoroughly
entertained.
The plot was very sharp, and for a Stalone movie the acting was better
than
average. The movie was filled with actors that enjoy acting.  Maybe the
best
part of the movie was just when you think you have the plot figured out
there is a complete change of direction.  I think that helped keep my
attention.  I actually got interested in the charactors and really wanted
to
figure out who the bad guy was.  I could recommend, with a clear
conscience,
this movie to anyone.   
<|_=00=_|>

I was in a dark mood and my DVD rental matched it. An older Sylvester
Stallone once again moves away from the 'invincible hero' image towards a
'vulnerable consummate professional' image. Although it unfortunately
includes today's staple of graphic violence, the suspense still overwhelmes.
Several established names portray unusual characters whose real
personalities unwantingly surface in the course of events. Overall the
mystery of a whodunit dominates until almost the end. To increase the mood
of darkness founded by the story's theme, the bulk of the film is shot at an
isolated location in mostly dark, low light scenes. Characters are
sufficiently defined for emotional association by viewer. This film
effectively accomplishes its task of delivering entertaining escapism for
its target audience during what today is considered a short runtime of 1-1/2
hours.

Why the crap did this get bad reviews? I mean, it is not a classic, but
my
god it was damn entertaining. There are some big story gaps but it is fun
none-the-less. Stallone actually goes deeper into acting than his usual
and
it is surprisingly very good. Check it out anyways.

I was very dissapointed by this movie. Not because of what it was, but
because of what it could have been. The movie didn't seem to know what it
wanted to be. The first half of the movie was completely different than
the
second half. I actually enjoyed the movie until the killing at the detox
center started.

If this movie was a drama about cops recovering from their addictions I
think it would have been pretty good. The problem was that half way
through
the movie became a whodunnit slasher movie. Jim Gillespie seemed to be
stuck
back in the I Know What You Did Last Summer mode and forgot that he was
making a legitimate movie.

The worst thing about the movie was Tom Berenger. His character had no
importance except to throw you off and make you think that he's the
killer.
It was a completely pointless character. I was however impressed by the
performances by Jeffrey Wright (although they seemed to forget that he
existed in the last 20 minutes), and Sean Patrick Flannery (first killed
off
unfortunately).

I think this could've been quite good as a dramatic story about a cop in
detox trying to come to terms with his problems, but as a serial killer
thriller this movie is a flop.
<|_=00=_|>
I'm not going to bother with a detailed analysis of the film, its a
perfectly good thriller which will provide an evenings entertainment
for any one who likes the genre, plenty of action and tension in an
isolated setting, I'm mystified why it has received so much
criticism,its a perfectly good piece of cinema for the masses, i voted
a ten just to try and get the average up but really its a good 6 to
7.Perhaps its just fashionable to find fault with everything stallone
does, he sure has done some duffers but this isn't one of them, rocky
and the rambo series typecast him for a while as a dumbo who acts
dumbos, but he has shown a much greater variety of acting ability in
subsequent films, but i admit i am fearfull of the rumours that another
rambo and rocky film are a possibility!

STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal
Instead*Avoid At All Costs

Stallone and the director of I Know What You Did Last Summer sound like an
intriguing combination.But this belated picture isn't really.Sly's
performance works more thanks to the script than to him,thanks to some
emotive scenes at the beginning,otherwise he's as blank as he was in the
Rambo movies.Worse than that,the story is told in a really
straight-forward,unoriginal way,you can see scenes coming before you've even
seen them.There are few real jolts or surprises.There's some okay action in
between,but to be honest,it's hard to understand why this didn't go straight
to video.**
<|_=00=_|>

I actually own this film & Sly plays a brilliant and surprising part in
this
chilling film.  I would tell anyone who asked me to watch it for
themselves,
and if your a Sly freakette like me, you'll really enjoy
it!
