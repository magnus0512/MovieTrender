This movie received a 1 star out of 5 rating (=awful) in the Radio Times
but
I decided to watch it none the less since it starred Matthew Broderick,
looked fun and some of these 'dreadful' films are quite
fun.

Well, I loved it, perhaps because I felt sorry for this poor, put upon
underdog, but my opinion was genuine, one of the most fun films I'd seen
(maybe ever). Dumb and Dumber is similar in some respects but much too
brash
in my opinion and without the subtlety and charm and downright sense of
fun
of this effort.

This movie has an unbelievable plot (at least it has a plot ... I have seen
way too many that have no plot) but that is what makes it so funny.  Just
the Jims alone make it funny.  Two drunk brothers with the same first name
that find a dead guy and think he is just drunk too.  Definitely worth a
watch at least once. 
<|_=00=_|>

The 2 brothers named Jim are hilarious drunks.
Plus there's the whole mistaken Identity thing going on, with evil
twins, except that neither one of them is really the good twin.

They're both fairly evil.
It's a lighthearted silly comedy, but I still think it's
great.

An executive leaves his hometown to complete a $140M deal. Along the way
he
loses his wallet which contains the main ingredient for closing the deal.
While trying to get the wallet back he meets every manner of opposition
and
zany characters. I really liked Jim & Jim and the Siskle & Ebert clones.
One
of the funniest comedies I ever saw. 4 stars.

I caught 'Out On A Limb' on TV late one night and expected to hate it. The
plot is everywhere at once, there are so many characters only a competent
director could give each their own traits and personality and the seen were
Jeffrey Jones kills himself is so "B-Movie", one can't help but
cringe.

However it's these "negative factors" that make Veber's movie so watchable.
Broderick, Jones, Kling and the young girl playing the narrator all give
decent performances, however it is the then-unknown John C. Reilly and
Michael Monks that steal the movie as the dim-witted, red necks Jim and
Jim.

Visually, the film seems to capture that small town middle America feel.
And
the two "temp" Deputy's are an utter delight to watch onscreen.

I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants to unwind with a plot that
draws you in without becoming stressful.

My wife and I watch this film whenever we want a good laugh. The plot,
characters and cast combine to provide the most hilarious "good
feeling" comedy we have ever seen (this is our favorite!). The whole
story is built around the classroom recitation by a young girl about
how she spent her summer. The bizarre chain of events she tells about
are deliberated at intervals throughout the movie by her unbelieving
classmates. During these brief interludes she is coaxed to go on with
her intriguing story and the action takes off -- again! This movie is
superbly acted and directed to avoid the pitfalls of becoming "slap
stick." While the plot is a bit far fetched, it is plausible. If you
want to see a movie that makes you feel good and is viewable by people
of any age, this is a "must see."

every time I've seen this movie since the first time I saw it in 1993
or so on television it has been missing about 10 minutes in running
time. I just watched it again on Netflix and it has a run time listed
of 1 hr 22 minutes which is 82 minutes instead of the total 93 it
should have. I also own a copy on VHS which is missing a section. This
missing scene is of Bill and Sally running from the bear and Skearns
which is an extended chase scene which includes them being literally
out on a limb of a large (redwood?) tree which breaks resulting them
falling into either a river or pond. This is why in the next scene they
are in- when they enter the Van Der Haven home- their clothes are wet.
Also missing as I recall is a scene with the Siskel and Ebert
schoolchildren giving Marci's storytelling a thumbs up/down.

I don't know why this movie isn't more popular than it is- I keep
expecting it to turn into a cult classic.

For those of us that lived thru those weeks of filming in town and
around the Valley - lest we not forget the tedious days of road
closures and "film-making". As a reminder to those that live here -
locales include Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, Big Basin. etc.
The bank was the BC firehouse; chase scenes included Moon Drive off Hwy
236, Empire Grade Rd, and Hwy 1.

Production: Jeffrey Jones was the most approachable, Matt Broderick was
above us all - even back then. As far as the film goes - a joke of a
script and even a bigger laugh regarding acting and plot - but who
cares at this level. A nice time capsule for those that enjoy our coast
and valley scenery.

Additional notes; Joe's Bar (Jed's Tavern in the film), original name
of the film was Welcome to Buzzsaw - the Old Erba's parking lot was the
town square, the backyard shots were off of Grove Street in Boulder
Creek; turn off the thinking cap and see a few actors in their early
days.

Sometimes I watch a movie for it's distractive escape value. This silly,
multi-faceted story with the back drop of a child's "What did you do this
summer?" tale is fine a beer and potato chip viewing and leaves you with
"Hey Baby, Que Paso?" humminn' in your head. Lighten up!
<|_=00=_|>
This is a great movie for some laughs, but more importantly it leaves a
smile on your face the next day as you think about it. Seeing
Broderick's short, stubby, naked body as the kids in the school bus
drive by and scream is classic! John C Reilly played a great "Jim"
along with his brother "Jim." And the twins, played by Jeffrey Jones,
are nigh unto hilarious. The "Evil Twin" has to take over the role of
his good twin and become husband, uncle and mayor, and this creates a
lot of humorous situations. When they think the twin is drunk in the
bar and say that he is "shitfaced," but he was dead, was funny. There
are a lot of one-liners that make you crack a smile. Overall, it's a
great movie for a relaxing night with friends and popcorn...er, popcorn
and friends, whichever you give priority.
