I remember first seeing this movie when I was about five years old, and I
found it hilarious.  I caught the movie a couple more times on network TV,
but this is the first time I watched it again in its unedited form. 

Needless to say, Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder are both wonderful talents
with an irreplacable chemistry, and that chemistry is utilized very well
throughout.  Of course, the brilliantly original premise helps as well.  A
blind guy and a deaf guy who pair up to solve a murder?  Classic!  That
premise is used wonderfully.  There's a great line where they're
interrogated and angry officer screams out, "Between the two of you, you saw
and heard everything!"  

There's a lot of great fish-out-of-water humor involving Pryor's blindness
and Wilder's deafness.  One of the most hilarious gags, along with the car
chase, is when Pryor helps another blind man to walk across the street, and
they end up in the back of a truck.  Now that's a literal example of the
blind leading the blind.  Each gag is delivered and timed very well, thanks
for the great actors and veteran director Arthur Hiller, who has directed
the two leads before in "Silver Streak."  

This isn't a perfect comedy.  A few gags fall flat, but the key word is
"few."  Some reviewers and audiences have regarded this as the low point in
Wilder's and Pryor's careers.  I think of "Another You" as the low point,
which is a horribly forgettable comedy that unfortunately was the last film
they did together.

A good deal of the gags are far-fetched, but this is a slapstick farce and
you have to expect that.  That's why I always say that this is a very tricky
sub-genre and if not done correctly, the audience will totally stop
suspending disbelief and simply scoff at its foolishness.

Fans of Pryor and Wilder should not be disappointed.  Also, if you want to
see an early (comic) performance by Kevin Spacey, it's also worth checking
out.  Speaking of worth checking out, Joan Severance provides great eye
candy, and she has a couple of nude scenes to boot.  I was born in 1982, so
this was the first movie where I saw the two comics together on screen, so
"See No Evil" is more unique to me than it probably is to others.  But come
on!  With scenes like a high-speed car chase involving a blind man and a
deaf man trying to escape, how can this not be regarded as a "unique"
comedy?  

My score:  7 (out of 10)

Just saw this movie again recently, and it still gets me laughing like
crazy.  This was the first Pryor/Wilder movie I ever saw, when it first
came
out on video, and it eventually got me to the video store several more
times
to see their other movies.  Although all of them got me laughing
(especially
Silver Streak), this one was by far the funniest.  It's definitely an
underrated movie.  I only wish Pryor and Wilder had done more
together.

Hilarious, side splitting, very clever humour by two of the best comedy
actors ever.

I have seen this film several times now, and each time is as amusing as the
first.

You have just got to watch this film!

"See no evil, Hear no evil"; a perfect title for an hilarious script that
was brilliantly portrayed by Gene Wilder (Dave) and Richard Pryer (Wally).
The tale of two "handicapped" (as Dave remarks at the end of the film,
"I'm
not handicapped, I have you") individuals who come together to be ones
eyes.
The hilarious duo get caught in a crime they did not commit and do
everything in thier power to rid them of the accusation.

I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie tremendously.  I
remember
watching it when it first came out in 1989 and thinking, "wow...what a
funny
flick".  Being only 11 at the time, I didn't really understand the
hilarity
of all the jokes that was in it.  The reason why I watch it again now...
13
years later is because of one Kevin Spacey (Who plays Kirgo, the crook).
I'm in the process of collecting all of his movies... and this one just
happens to be one in that list.  I'm glad that it is.  I find the script
to
be wonderfull, the acting brilliant and the time spent watching it a
definate fun time.  Great movie!!

Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder are probably one of the best comedy couples
around. And this title is probably one of the best they made together. The
most of the credit goes here to Richard, who played his part really
hilariously.

Anyway, a nice late-eighties comedy, with some great laughs and not so
great
plot. But hey, who cares about that, when you "smile your pants
off".

7 out of 10

Not quite as good as Silver Streak and Stir Crazy but this Gene Wilder &
Richard Pryor outing never fails in putting a big smile on my face.Seen it
loads of times now and it's as funny as the first time, brilliant
stuff.
<|_=00=_|>

This has to be one of the funniest films ever made.Two of the best comic
actors in recent history.Who has there been since?next to this film I would
have to put stire crazy but see no evil just eclipses it with the perfect
timing of the jokes and the best scene of all fuzzy wuzzy was a what?{HAS
TO
BE SEEN}

Unfortunetely, I watch this movie two days before Richard Pryor dies
from an heart attack, he was such a wonderful actor. The teacher of
many black actors of nowadays including Eddie Murphy, Wesley Snipes and
Chris Rock. As for the movie, it's the kind of comedy you want to watch
every time you watch a comedy. You see? I don't! You hear? I don't!!
That's two man, Richard Pryor as the blind guy (perfect choice by the
way) and one of his best friends of all time, the talented Gene Wilder,
who make the guy who can't hear. So he follow the words on the mouths
of people. The plot is yet simple but effective. The beautiful Joan
Severance and a unknown Kevin Spacey at that time make the villains in
this movie. They are so credible, that you believe them. So I would say
one thing about this movie and it's MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!!! You have 2
talented actors and you don't even care about the script anymore
because they are so talented than they can make look good any movie
they are involved to. Here, we have a good storyline, so it helps even
more. You laugh about all the time even when you think ''It's too
stupid to make this'', yeap, but you laugh because you are watching one
of the best comedies of all times. The writing stuff is genius, they
make this movie and probably at that time, it was another movie like
this, but as of today, it has become a cult classic for every Richard
Pryor fans! Thank you Richard for everything!

I love this movie! This is the best movie Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor
were in together. (My second favorite is Stir Crazy.) How genius? A
blind guy and a deaf guy running from the police and two murders and
are wanted for a murder they never committed. Its just so simple yet so
clever! I'm a big fan of both Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor as well as
Kevin Spacey and John Capodice. My favorite scene in the movie is when
Wally is trying to drive the police car and the police and the killers
are after him. That was great! A blind man driving, hitting everything
and driving in places he shouldn't have bee driving. Woo! Next time you
want to see a Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor movie watch See No Evil,
Hear No Evil.

This movie is absolutely hilarious. If you are looking for a funny movie I
would definitely recommend this one!! Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder are
classic together. The crazy antics of the two characters is incredibly
funny.
