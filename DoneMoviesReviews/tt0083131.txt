Stripes is firmly planted in my vernacular as one of those films that
helped shape me as a twelve year old boy. It is also one of those films
that made me become the film lover that I am today. I know films like
Star Wars and it's two sequels, First Blood and Rambo, Jaws and it's
sequel, Halloween, Back To The Future, Ghostbusters, Raiders and it's
sequels and Stripes ( there are many others but this review has to be
under 1000 words )taught me the beauty of how a movie can make you
feel. And Stripes was the first movie that me and my best friend at the
time ( Gary ) ever memorized word for word. And I think that it is this
movie that established Murray, Ramis and even guys like Candy and John
Laroquette as comedians. It also has a small role for Bill Paxton in it
somewhere. It was also a great stepping stone for the three amigos (
Murray, RAmis and Reitman ) to get funding for a bigger project like
Ghostbusters. And if you were an executive at Columbia you would
probably hand them a blank cheque for that project after seeing this
film. Simply put this film is a classic in every sense of the word.

Stripes tells the story of how John Winger and Russell Ziskey ( Murray
and Ramis respectively ) are two losers in life. Winger is an inept cab
driver that hates his job so much that he throws his keys off the city
bridge one day while driving an annoying lady to the airport. Ziskey is
a terrible English as a second language teacher. And he is so inept
that he tries to get is class to sing songs during class as their
lesson. " I met her on a Monday and my heart stood still " Ziskey
sings, and his class responds " da do da da da da da da da do da da da
da, " and the he congratulates them and dismisses them until next week.

After Winger informs Ziskey that in the last three hours he has lost
his job, his car, his apartment and his girlfriend, they decide to join
the army. And then all hilarity breaks loose. It is here that we meet
an assorted cast of hooligans and misfits that add to the enjoyment of
the movie.

You have Ox ( Candy ) as an overweight guy who thinks the army is a
perfect place to lose weight for free. There is Francis Sawyer, but
everyone calls him Psycho, as a nut that thinks he is in Vietnam or
someplace. You also have Cruiser, who joined the army because his
father and brother were in the army and also because he thought he
should join before he got drafted. Then there is Elmo, who is played by
a pre-Fast Times Judge Reinhold. He is a wasted jolly stoner who is
jjst looking to get stoned. Why he is joining the army is a little
perplexing, but really, who cares? He is fun to watch so little details
like this are overlooked. And of course we have Sgt. Hulka played with
absolute earnestness by the late great Warren Oates. Needless to say,
it is an interesting bunch of characters.

The film works for various reason, but mainly because Ramis and Dan
Goldberg have written a hilarious script that puts the misfits through
one twistedly funny situation after another. If only the army were this
fun, everyone would want to enlist.

The first half of the film works because of the basic training scenes.
The second half works because the misfit recruits are assigned to
protect a secret R.V. that the army has concocted. Winger and Ziskey of
course can't stay bored for long and they take the R.V. out for a run
to Austria to go pick up their girlfriends.

Stripes is one of the funniest movies ever made and it should be
checked out by younger people that were born after 1980. I was about 12
when I saw this and my dad laughed at this just as much as I did. And
if all you have to go on for comedy is things like Waterboy and Big
Daddy ( very funny movies in their own right ) you are missing some
great older comedy. You should really check this out.

May be THE classic Bill Murray movie, with Murray, Ramis, Candy and
other
oddballs making it in the Army.  There are three general sequences -
Murray
pre-Army, basic training, and the mission (occurring after Murray and
Ramis
"borrow" Army test vehicle with their MP girlfriends).  Each of the
sequences are funny, I personally like Murray pre-Army best and the
mission
least.  Warren Oates as "Sgt. Hulka" is a modern classic.  Over twenty
years
later and this is still the reigning service comedy.
<|_=00=_|>
Stripes begins as a fine and very funny military service farce with
Bill Murray losing his job, girlfriend, and apartment, all in the same
day. He decides, with his good buddy Harold Ramis, that they should
both join the Army. Some of the funniest parts of Stripes are in the
beginning of the movie with Bill's character trying to do push-ups,
exhausted as he is trying to do as little as 5. Ramis cracks, "I think
your ready for the Special Olympics!" Harold also shines in a bit-part
in teaching English to a class of all foreign students. He finds out
that there are only a few in the class that speak any English at all.
He asked a student who raises his hand, "You speak some English?" The
student answers back "SOB and $hit" and the whole class than repeats
it.

The Basic Training sequences are very funny. Warren Oates shines as a
tough drill Sergent, and in addition to SCTV alumni Ramis, John Candy
joins the fun as likable, lovable "Ox." There are the typical sex gags,
simple jokes, visit to a strip bar, that you would expect in this type
of movie and Murray, Candy, Ramis, and Oates keep the comedy fun to
watch. However, this is probably due more to the talents of these
actors, rather than the storyline, which was done a year earlier with
Goldie Hawn in another similar Army movie, Private Benjamin. There is
nothing new or original about Stripes. Its best parts are in the first
hour.

After the graduation from Basic Training, our likable recruits are
assigned to man a top secret vehicle on a special assignment in Europe.
Here is where this great comedy falls apart, because at this sequence
of the movie, all the good parts have already happened, so the viewer
has to spend about 40 minutes watching the group operate the machine,
having silly one-lines like, "Wow!!! let's see what this thing can do."
rescue some of their group who get temporarily captured in
Czechoslovakia, and than arrive home to the predictable hero's welcome.
The film goes from funny service farce to a bad Robocop sequel. It's
almost as if the European mission sequence was needed, because the
producers didn't want to end the film at 90 minutes.

I suppose that it was needed for the recruits to do something with
their Army training. The problem is that once the team gets to Europe,
the things they do aren't funny anymore and the plot wears thin because
of this. The first half of Stripes gets a solid 8, the second half (a
generous) 4. Therefore, my overall rating of Stripes is a 6.
<|_=00=_|>
He quit his job and lost his girlfriend. before Lost in Translation and
Broken Flowers, he was just a wacky pain-in-the-ass recruit that gave
Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates) nightmares. When it comes to comedy Bill
Murray is a winner hands down.

Add in John Candy; John Larroquette as the peeping Capt. Stillman;
Judge Reinhold; Harold Ramis; the quick peep at Roberta Leighton; and
the hot Lois Hamilton and you have a military comedy of errors that
will keep you in stitches.

Of course there is a lot of beautiful scenery in this film in the
showers and in the mud pit.
<|_=00=_|>

Stripes is a raunchy, adult comedy from critically acclaimed
producer/director Ivan Reitman (Evolution, Kindergarten Cop). And it stars
Bill Murray (The Royal Tenenbaums), Harold Ramis (As Good as it Gets), John
Candy (Uncle Buck), Warren Oates (True Grit).

Low life cab driver John Winger (Bill Murray) loses a lot in 2 hours. That
is his job, his apartment, his girlfriend, his car. So, he decides that he's
had enough of his pathetic life in New York, so he decides to join the army.
He also talks his friend Russel Ziskey (Harold Ramis) into joining with
him.

When they finally do join, they are both put into a platoon drilled by Sgt.
Hulka (Warren Oates) who has his eye on John. They both go through weeks and
weeks of hell by doing basic training and putting up with Sgt. Hulka. But,
they full fill their goal by meeting Stella (P.J. Soles) and Louise (Sean
Young), two beautiful MP's who have their eys on Russel and
John.

As the story moves on, they go to battle in Germany and end up in more
hilarious confilcts.

I must say, I think that Warren Oates was a perfect choice for Sgt. Hulka,
and that he was so brilliant and funny with the character. I give him
graditude.
                                   1921-1982

This is not a movie for kids, but teens may enjoy it if they are looking for
a hilarious comedy. STRIPES is 100% classic and comedy!
<|_=00=_|>
Despite the fact that there is no way on God's green earth or this
country's army that such a set of circumstances could ever happen,
that's still no reason not to enjoy Stripes. The film is in a long line
of service comedies that date all the way back to Charlie Chaplin's
Shoulder Arms and further than that. Even Shakespeare found some humor
in army life, just read how Falstaff made do in the service of his
king.

Of course Falstaff wasn't a drill sergeant like Warren Oates who had a
platoon of underachievers with the likes of Bill Murray, Harold Ramis,
and John Candy as recruits. As is usual the service comedies make a
mistake in that the basic training company stays intact with the same
sergeant. In real life Oates would have taken a drink when the eight
weeks was done and gone on to some fresh young trainees.

But some brain in the Pentagon decides that what a new type urban
assault vehicle needs is some fresh recruits to maintain it, reasoning
if the vehicle is worthy it can stand up to goofballs. The vehicle
looks like your ordinary average camper, in fact Murray and Ramis while
they're guarding it decide it would be a great chick magnet. So they
pick up a pair of female MPs in P.J. Soles and Sean Young. 

The officer in charge is John Larroquette who isn't much better than
the recruits he has and when the vehicle turns up missing, he sounds
the general alarm worthy of the Captain in Mister Roberts. He leads the
whole troop after Murray and Ramis right into at that time Communist
Czechoslovakia and some nasty Russians. Good thing they didn't have
their A team playing either.

Stripes is your typical armed service comedy with a nice Eighties twist
from Bill Murray and a crew from Saturday Night Live just coming into
their prime as players. John Larroquette is the best in the film,
imagine ADA Dan Fielding in an army uniform and you got Larroquette's
character. You notice the New York County DA's office never gives
Fielding any really big cases to handle.

And yes that vehicle can withstand anything and it has more tricks than
James Bond's Astin-Martin. To see what and how much, you have to watch
Stripes.

I didn't like this Bill Murray vehicle when it was originally released
in the 80s, so I tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this
film was down to my movie-going tastes in the 80s or was it that
"Stripes" is simply a bad movie. Well, the verdict is in and "Stripes"
is a bad movie.

Now, "Stripes" may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s, and it
may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are
Bill Murray fans, but its still a bad movie.

Why is it bad? Mostly because "Stripes" is supposed to be a comedy but
it's just not that funny. There are some laughs, but they are few and
far between. Most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which
is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting. This lack of comedy
is especially noticeable if you're used to more contemporary comedies
such as "Anchorman" which strive for laughs in every part of the movie.

"Stripes" further suffers from Bill Murray and Harold Ramis's lack of
acting ability. Bill Murray is a great comedian but he was not a very
compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career, and Harold Ramis
is playing Harold Ramis. These two are just not good enough as actors
to carry the dramatic arch of the movie.

Lastly, most of the comedy that there is in "Stripes" revolves around
Bill Murray's self-centered, smart-alec man-child character so if you
don't find that character funny (like I didn't) you're not going to
find most of what little comedy there is in "Stripes" funny either.

"Stripes" is very much a movie of its era, it hasn't aged well and is
not worth watching. If you want to watch an early 80's "buddy" comedy I
would recommend "Stir Crazy." Like "Stripes" the humor in "Stir Crazy"
is not as fast-paced as in contemporary comedies, but unlike "Stripes"
it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable.

After a terrible day when the taxi driver John Winger (Bill Murray)
loses his job, his car and finally is dumped by his girlfriend Anita
(Roberta Leighton), he convinces his best friend Russell (Harold Ramis)
to join the army to travel and have fun. They team-up with a platoon of
outcast and misfits, and John has problems with their tough Sergeant
Hulka (Warren Oates). John and Russell get into successive troubles,
but they are always rescued by the Military Police Officers Stella
(P.J. Soles) and Louise (Sean Young). 

Near the graduation, the clumsy and imbecile Captain Stillman (John
Larroquette) provokes an accident and Sergeant Hulka is wounded;
however, John uses his leadership and the general is impressed with the
platoon and assigns the group to go to Italy with the prototype of an
armored car. John and Russell are responsible to take care of the
prototype, but they date Stella and Louise. Meanwhile Captain Stillman
believes that they have stolen the vehicle and crosses the Iron Curtain
with Hulka's platoon and they are captured by the communist. Sergeant
Hulka escapes and releases a distress signal and John, Russell, Stella
and Louise decide to help to rescue their friends from Czechoslovakia.

"Stripes" is a silly and funny comedy, but what else could I expect
from a cast with the names of Bill Murray, John Candy, John Larroquette
and the other comedians. The extended cut is long and most of the jokes
are "politically incorrect" or sexists, but also hilarious. This is the
first time that I see this 1981 comedy on DVD and I laughed a lot. My
vote is six.

Title (Brazil): "Recrutas da Pesada" ("Rough Recruiters")
<|_=00=_|>
Everyone is funny in this film. Every performance is first-rate and
each character adds something to the humor of this movie.

Stripes begins with Bill Murray losing his job, his car and his
girlfriend all in the same day. His buddy Harold Ramis is also leading
a lackluster life teaching the English language to foreigners who know
only curse words. These depressing circumstances set the stage for
Murray to convince Ramis to come with him and join the Army.

Basic training, a hard-ass drill sergeant, female military police and
naked mud wrestling consume the rest of this hilarious film. Anyone who
appreciates smart-ass humor should see this. However Murray and Ramis
are the focal point of most of the humor in Stripes and are very easy
to relate to. Also stars John Candy, P.J. Soles, Sean Young, John
Larroquette and Judge Reinhold.

	In one of his funniest comedies, Bill Murray takes on the U.S. Army, and
without question, with guys like this on the front lines, we can all sleep a
little easier at night.  `Stripes,' directed by Ivan Reitman, is the story
of John Winger (Murray), who in one day loses his girl, his job, his car and
his apartment.  So what's a guy to do after that, but join the Army?  But he
doesn't go alone, oh no-- he also talks his best friend, Russell Ziskey
(Harold Ramis) into joining with him.  And just like that they find
themselves at boot camp, face to face with one of the most formidable Drill
Instructors every to grace the silver screen, Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates),
and surrounded by as motley a group of raw recruits as anyone could imagine.
 Among them, there's Dewey Oxburger (John Candy), known as `Ox,' who plans
to emerge from boot camp a `lean, mean fighting machine'; and `Cruiser (John
Diehl),' who joined up to beat the draft (Hulka:  `Son, there isn't a draft,
anymore.'  Cruiser:  `There was one?'); and Francis Soyer (George Jenesky),
known as `Psycho' (`Call me Francis, and I'll kill you.  Touch my stuff, and
I'll kill you.  Touch me...and I'll kill you.'  Hulka:  `Lighten up,
Francis...').

	The pressure is on for Hulka and his men, when Colonel Glass (Lance
LeGault) informs Captain Stillman (John Larroquette) that the `General' is
looking for a squad of crack new recruits to man a special project, and
Hulka's boys have been chosen.  The project involves a secret weapon, an
`urban assault' vehicle, that is to be unveiled on their base in Germany
shortly.  But first, Hulka has to get his troops through basic, which will
be a minor miracle in itself, even though Winger goes `Out on a limb,' and
offers to be their leader.  And things proceed just as badly as you would
expect, not only on the obstacle course, but off, when Winger and Ziskey get
mixed up with a couple of female M.Ps., Stella (P.J. Soles) and Louise (Sean
Young), and Ox gets coerced (by Winger, of course) into taking part in a
female mud-wrestling event at a local night spot.  

	Along the way, Reitman sets up the situations for some serious laughs, and
keeps it all on track with a good pace and excellent timing.  Murray is
terrific as Winger, with a performance that puts a generous helping of `dry'
in the expression `dry humor.'  He plays it all so straight, so serious,
from his quips and one liners (watching a TV promo for the Army, `This looks
pretty good--'), to his full blown inspirational speech to the troops on the
night before their final test at basic training (`We're all very different
people.  We're not Spartans, we're not Watusi, we're Americans, with a
capital A.'  That means our forefathers were thrown out of every decent
country in the world--'), that it makes it all the more hilarious.  He never
tries to be `funny,' or fish for laughs, which is really what makes this
movie work so well.  Murray is perhaps the best in the business at playing
this kind of humor and putting it across (Ben Stiller would be a close
second).  

	Harold Ramis and John Candy also make invaluable contributions that make
this one fly.  Watch Ramis, reacting to what Candy is saying as `Ox,' as
explains why he joined the Army; it makes what Ox is saying twice as funny. 
And Ox, talking about what a `shy guy' he is, and how `You may have noticed,
I have this weight problem--'  And Oates, as well, gives a singular
performance that makes Hulka a real person, beyond the typical stereotype of
the hard-nosed D.I.  His portrayal, taken out of context, is one that would
stand up even in more serious fare, like Kubrick's `Full Metal
Jacket.'

	The supporting cast includes Judge Reinhold (Elmo), John Voldstad
(Stillman's Aide), Roberta Leighton (Anita), Antone Pagan (Hector), Fran
Ryan (Dowager in Cab), Dave Thomas (M.C.) and William Lucking (Recruiter). 
From beginning to end, `Stripes' is a fun-filled laugh riot that's filled
with memorable scenes and a plethora of lines you'll be quoting forever. 
This is one you can watch over and over again, with a bunch of characters
you're never going to forget.  Winger and Ziskey, Ox, Psycho, Cruiser. 
These are the guys who Demi Moore, as Galloway in `A Few Good Men,' could
have been talking about when, in response to the question of why she likes
these guys so much, replies, `Because they stand on a wall, and they say
nothing is going to hurt you tonight, not on my watch...'  It kind of makes
you think.  Or, as Cruiser might say, `Yeah...  About what?'  I rate this
one 10/10.
