Police Academy (1984) was the first of many films from this series.
Since this was the 80's and this film was very successful there was
only one alternative, milk the cash cow until it was dry. Like most of
these films, the first one is the best and most creative of the bunch.
The film follows a bunch of losers and outcasts who join the local
police academy for various reasons. The main character is Mahoney
(played by Steve Guttenberg) a man with a shady past who enrolls in the
academy as an alternative punishment for a previous criminal act. He
becomes the motley crew's leader and representative.

This movie made Guttenberg a star and it started a film series that
would live on D.T.V. and make the producers a lot of money. It also
gave people jobs and made others into minor stars. I found this movie
to be very entertaining. If you're into juvenile humor and a bunch of
cheap laughs, then I recommend this movie. Others need not apply.
Followed by six sequels!!

Recommended for some laughs and low brow humor. Hey, it's one of the
essentials.

Okay, so "Police Academy" is probably the ultimate manifestation of the
word "witless". But it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what
it is: nice, silly fun. The plot basically has a series of goof-off
misfits enrolling in the police force and turning it topsy-turvy. Steve
Guttenberg, as Cadet Carey Mahoney, may have to remember this as his
peak in movies, and he does a pretty good job here.

Anyway, the movie is pretty much an excuse to be silly. And they do
just that. With hilarious one-liners and one gag after another, you
won't be disappointed. Of course, I advise you not to watch it if
you're the type who only wants to see "important" movies.

I don't understand why this movie has such a low rating on IMDb (right
now it's 6.1, that isn't so bad but this movie deserves more). It's a
classic comedy which is still funny even after 20 years. It always
elate me. Jokes are pretty simple and even innocent compared to
nowadays movies but that's probably what's good about this film because
it's funny to watch to whole family. You'll fall in love with a
characters and this movie itself so much that every time you'll hear a
theme of Police Academy it will make you smile. If you haven't watched
it yet you definitely have to do it because they don't make this kind
of movies anymore.

During my spring break in 1984, I went up to Michigan to see some of my
relatives. One day while I was up there I went to see "Police Academy" with
my mom, my grandma, and a cousin. Before we saw this, I remembered Chicago
Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert gave this movie no stars. I also
remembered Ebert reviewing this movie on his show "At The Movies" with his
late partner Gene Siskel (this was before their show went nationwide and was
retitled "Siskel & Ebert"). Ebert summed up "Police Academy" in one short
sentence: "IT IS BAD!!!" And Siskel agreed with him. But I went to see this
movie anyway and to this day I'm glad that I did. "Police Academy" made me
laugh my head off. After the movie was over I said it was the funniest movie
since "Airplane!" This movie was so funny I went to see it a second time
over Memorial Day weekend 1984 with a friend of mine here in Chicago.
"Police Academy" still makes me laugh to this day. It's too bad the sequels
didn't live up to this, the original. The second, third, and fourth movies
in the series were marginally funny. The fifth and sixth movies were less
funny and the series started to wear out its welcome. I've never seen the
seventh movie "Mission to Moscow" but I heard it's a stinker. So I'm
sticking with the first movie because it's the funniest.

**** (out of four)

Yep, this is the one that started it all.  The right one to blame.  "Police
Academy" - never duplicated, countlessly imitated.

But before you go throwing any stones...this one is funny.

Yep, believe it or not, its joke success ratio is amazingly high.  Is it
because it's R-rated?  That's a lot of it, but it also has a good pedigree. 

Director/co-writer Wilson also created TV's "WKRP in Cincinnati", Israel and
Proft have written "Bachelor Party" and some other funny stuff you may have
heard of (they had a hand in the "Naked Gun" films).

And the cast, in this instance, is fresh!  Guttenberg has seldom been
better, nor has Cattrall (well, maybe except for "Porky's"), Gaynes, Bailey,
Smith, Winslow or Easterbrook.  There are a handful of good lines, more good
scenes here than in any four of the sequels you can name and plenty more
opportunity for good old raunchy "Animal House"-style guffaws.

You don't believe me?  Think about the scene with the hooker (Spelvin) in
the speaker's podium.  Then think about the punch line ("Good speech."). 
You see?  Ah, memories.

Take it from a hard-bitten veteran of the series.  This is as good as it
gets.  You want to see a funny movie about cops?  Register at your local
"Police Academy".

Six stars, plus a star more for Guttenberg's final scene. 
Classic.

This is a great movie for relaxing after a hard day at work. It's sheer
escapism and good-humoured fun that only requires the watcher to put
their mind in neutral, rest their feet, and not think too much.

A lot of the gags are not very original; we've seen most of them before
in some other form. But the basic premise of a Police Academy full of
misfits provides a novel context. 

I've only seen this first movie of the series and don't really have
plans to see any of the others. Can't believe they've made
ssssssssooooo many sequels.

Too much Police Academy could certainly wear a bit thin, but first time
around it's sheer good fun.

I don't know what got to me. This evening, I went to the video store
and got this one. I first saw it back in the 80's. Now let's not go
nuts and call this the best comedy of all times. But it's still a
pretty decent one (or indecent if you prefer!). The movie is generally
funny, the characters are likable, and it's filmed in Toronto! I was
surprised to realize that with the first scene showing the Toronto
skyline. Some scenes are very funny, especially the one with George
Gaynes (Commandant Lassard). Ah! the podium scene! So funny! Pea-brain
humor, but good pea-brain humor!

Out of 100, I gave it 71. That's good for ** out of ****.

Seen in Toronto, on April 5th, 2003.

It turns out that the mayor of a city is wanting to have a better Police
force and so opens up a more spaces in the Police Academy so that more
people may apply. It turns out that the new applicants are a bunch of
losers, wackos, and other various people that just don't fit
in.

The whole film is very funny. The characters are normal but very different
making them look like complete misfits against each other.
But the show is stolen by G.W. Bailey who plays the mean but brilliant
Lieutenant Harris.

The movie is a very funny and promising film that is lots of fun.

A Group of Wannabe's and a Doesn't Wannabe, Carey Mahoney (Steve
Guttenberg) Join the Police Academy in the hope of becoming respected
members of the Police Force.

There's a problem, they are with out doubt the worst bunch of wannabe's
the police academy has ever seen and Carey just can't wait to get
kicked out, only being there because it was the only way he could avoid
jail.

Some Truly Funny Moments and lots of memorable characters, this film is
a bloody good romp, that should be enjoyed by most people.

Too bad the sequels generally sucked big time! 

7/10

I loved this when it first came out...what's not to like-Rizzo from Mash's
headlong flight...uh, at the horse there, the little accident prone guy's
setting off a chain reaction by tossing an apple, Steve Guttenburg's goofy
deadpan all throughout this, plus a scene involving George Grizzard and the
Full Monica.  You will also enjoy Bubba Smith's driving
lessons.

Trust me. This one works, its funny, and its too bad the follow ups weren't
as raunchy or original. Yeah you can fault it for being as subtle as the
Three Stooges, but who cares? It's a hoot.

*** outta ****, makes me laugh and why not?
