This is quite a fascinating film.  It shows us how the criminal justice
system works and what it's like inside prison.  We feel intimidated,
hopeful, disgusted, and downright "in love", just as the lead character
does.  We can see both sides of the picture, too - from Captain Ellis' very
logical advice to the lawyers' dilemma.  The games the lawyers and judges
play are very realistic, as well.  This is based on a true story, and you'll
be very much caught up in it.  Both sides of the issue have good points.
I'm very glad this important issue was given center stage.

Don't believe everything in any movie that states, "Based on a true
story". This could have been a good movie and gone a lot further than
it did had they portrayed additional truth to this movie. I am a family
member and I know what really happened. The fact that they portrayed
that her family did NOT care or even call was CRAP!!! We were VERY
involved in her life through all of the events that led up to her
ending up in prison! And even when she was in prison..we were ALWAYS
there and NEVER EVER deserted her!!! So the next time you see a movie,
that is based on a true story..that is exactly what it
is....BASED...leaving some very important information out of a movie.
