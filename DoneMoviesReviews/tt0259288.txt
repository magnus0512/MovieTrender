Call me an soppy silly man, but I loved this movie. I loved every
sentimental sugar-coated silly second of it. I don't believe in life after
death and I think near death experiences are hallucinations, but this
movie
grabbed hold of me and didn't let go. I was genuinely surprised and
touched
by the ending. Great movie.

There is something strange about 'Dragonfly'. It is not a thriller in
its subject but it deals with it as if it's a thriller. Even more
strange, in some scenes it actually succeeds in that. I mean, when your
wife has died and she is trying to reach you from the other side is
something else than simply seeing dead people. Your wife probably has
the best intentions and although it is creepy you do not have to be
scared of your dead wife. I guess. The man who thinks his dead wife is
trying to reach him is Joe Darrow (Kevin Costner). Is he going mad, a
premise for a dramatic film, or is he really connecting to the other
side?

At times where his wife is communicating with Joe, at least to Joe's
knowledge, the film breaths a creepy atmosphere with a cinematography
and score that make things suspenseful. But the film does not have its
focus on whether Joe is going mad or not, but on how scary it is when a
dead person talks to you. That there is actually suspense shows that
there is some nice film-making to be found here. The premise is
interesting, although not that new, but especially the final act in the
film goes wrong at crucial points. There is a moment where I thought
the film was over, I will not reveal where, but at that time certain
things were left in the middle. It felt like the right ending. But then
the film continues, providing it with an ending that must have popped
into many heads from the audience, probably dismissed by a lot for
being too ridiculous.

Still, the premise and the first hour are good enough to keep us
entertained and although it should not work as a thriller, it does.
Watching it like that without thinking too much could help you like
this film in one way or another.

From the info on the DVD cover, I thought this was a going to be a science
fiction/horror movie. I was pleasantly surprised at what this was actually
about. The plot twist in the film is wonderful. Kevin Costner and the rest
of the cast do a convincing and thoroughly enjoyable job with this unique
premise. This film reminded me more of a "Field of Dreams" than a
"Poltergeist" kind of movie. The cast is revealing. Ron Rifkin (Alias) was a
great foil to Mr. Costner. Linda Hunt is perfect in the small role she
plays. The director, Mr. Shadyac, seems to have broken out of the comedy
mode (Liar, Liar; Ace Ventura) in a big and interesting way here. This is a
good one to see if you aren't into horror movies and want something that
stirs the little grey cells...I give it a 7 out of 10.

This is an awesome movie.  It is just right for Kevin Costner.  If I had a
doctor like him, I would actually go to see one.  The story is touching
and
beautiful.  I love it from beginning to end.  I wish others could
appreciate
this film as much as everybody I know, including myself, did.  I'm not a
real fan of spooky movies, but this was different.  It was hauntingly
beautiful. I would recommend seeing this on a cold, cloudy day, snuggling
with your heart's desire.

Setting aside several brilliant, but slashing technophile reviews, the
experience of the story is more important than the mechanics, or the fact
that several trendy notions have been graphed together.  I don't care that
it is New Age, Old Age, Stone Age... whatever.  I don't even care that
Costner doesn't seem to know where anything is going.  I don't care if the
director knew either.  This is a story about the spirit of the only person
absent from the film.  The thing that drives the fictional Emily in the
fictional tale is more compelling than anything else.  What mother would
not
defy death to see this plot to conclusion?  The broader message is most
uplifting, the very powerful, spiritual, magical force that is love.  It
isn't too difficult to mine this treasure from the mud.  Overall, I found
the story very interesting and it survives the mediocrity of dialog and
implausibility of the doctor's behavior at the hospital.  The movie is
even
better on the second viewing. Sue me, but I really liked
it.

Many may think they know the ending, but they will be suprised.  This is
a
beautiful film with much more depth and understanding than initially
appears.  If you think it is going to be an average hollywood ghost
story,
think again.
<|_=00=_|>

If you check your cynicism at the door, "Dragonfly" is astonishing in its
tenderness.  It's beautifully shot (Dean Semler of "Dances with Wolves"
and
"Waterworld") and well-acted.  It's a refreshing alternative to the
testosterone-driven films like "John Q", "Collateral Damage" and myriad
war
movies like "We Were Soldiers".  Kevin Costner is inexplicably Hollywood's
whipping boy but he still manages to make varied, provocative choices in
his
projects.  While I wanted to resist the heart-tug of the ending, I found I
simply couldn't.  If you let it, "Dragonfly" will take you someplace
sweet.

Given that films are generally produced as an entertainment medium, and
are
not produced for the arty fraternity amongst us, I found this film an
entertaining ride with a surprise ending.
Kevin costner has never been my favourite actor, but credit where it is
due
he has produced some good work over the years and this film was for me,
one
of his better efforts and I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to
finish.

****** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD ******

Ok, the wife going off an a trip to the jungle whilst six months pregnant
is unlikely, but hey.....people do stranger things in life ? don't they ?
it
is the viewers imagination that this film is aimed at, and those viewers
that don't have one will struggle to appreciate this film. I interpreted
this movie to be the living part of the sixth sense and from that point of
view, I thought it was well carried out. If I were to examine every little
detail of the film I could no doubt (as other reviewers have done) find
things that don't quite add up. But I won't do that, because I could do it
with every other film that has been made with the same
result.

Summary.
Very good film and well worth a look. 7/10 
<|_=00=_|>
Stubborn doctor Kevin Costner is supposed to be a non-believer in the
after-life, yet in a flashback sequence right near the beginning, he
talks with his wife about what life-form she wants to take after death.
You can tell something is definitely off right about here; the picture
doesn't know where to aim, and ends up firing at a myriad of targets.
There's a bird "who never talked to anyone" but Costner's deceased wife
(it later flies amok in the kitchen, with Costner calling out, "Big
Bird!"), and poor child actors in a hospital sequence who try to
convince Dr. Kevin that they've talked to "the lady" from beyond (seems
they saw her in the rainbow and she "flew them back"). It's AMAZING
that screenwriter David Seltzer managed to sell this thing. It's even
more stunning that Kevin Costner, Kathy Bates and Linda Hunt attempted
to make it work; they are overly-earnest in an assembly-line thriller
so formulaic we even get the scene where hard-working Dr. Kevin is
severely reprimanded for visiting sick kids by the hospital
administrator. It's the same scene you've seen a million times before,
mostly between a hard-nosed cop and the desk sergeant. * from ****

Dr. Joe Darrow (Kevin Costner) is a recently widowed doctor. He is
grieving due to the death of his pregnant wife in a Red Cross mission
in Venezuela. Although being atheist, he began to believe that his dead
wife wants to communicate with him, through her young patients in the
Pediatrics of a Chicago hospital. 

Although using many clichés, the plot is romantic and the story is
beautiful. However, the time taken by Joe Darrow to find out the
meaning of the symbol is amazingly long for such an obsessed and
intelligent character. Further, while his wife tries to contact him
through the almost dead persons, the story is OK. But if she had the
capacity of telekinesis, why not give him a clear written message? My
vote is seven.

Title (Brazil): "O Mistério da Libélula" ("The Mystery of the
Dragonfly")
