If you want to have a party in your mind, where just drift far far
away. Than look no further, because writer/director Reginald Hudlin has
made not only one of the best Afro-Americans based film. But also one
of the most copied haircuts in recent history.

Play(Christopher Martin) is having this banging HOUSE PARTY with buddy
Bilal(Martin Lawrence) DJing. But their best friend Kid(Christopher
Reid) can't go because he's Pops(Robin Harris in a terrific
performance) grounded him. So he sneaks out to join the party, but face
neighborhood bullies(Full Force) and the fact that two girls(Tisha
Campbell & A.J. Johnson) like him and wants him to choose between them.

The dance scenes are amazing and the songs are still hype. The acting
is great, especially by the late Robin Harris, who will have you
laughing at every scene he's in. And George Clinton's cameo is
absolutely funny as hell. So enjoy the movie that gave birth to HOW
HIGH, SOUL PLANE, and of course CLASS ACT in some ways.

 The kid'n'play dance was the thing back in the late 80s early 90s. The new
jack swing was at its peak and this movie sums it up. It became a
break-through for then young actors Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell. This
reminds me of the time when I was a teenager who wanted to sneak out to go
to a party and later got caught. I was in the 10th grade when this movie was
released and I had a lot of fun during that time with not too much fighting
at parties. The bullies played by the R&B group Full Force made the movie
more funny with its slapstick humor and the memorable Robin Harris with his
witty punchlines. It's sad to see him leave this earth at an early age,and
comedian Bernie Mac reminds me of him. I remember he died the weekend of
this movie and this was a shock.
He could have been one of the funniest comedians in the 90s but his life was
put to a halt and made way for several comedians who are now today's
superstars (namely from Def Comedy Jam). House Party also remind me of how
fun hip-hop was,and back then hip-hop was political,educational,radical,and
uplifting. This movie can go down in history as how African-Americans can
enjoy themselves with no use of drugs and unprotected sex.

I saw this movie when I was like 6 years old and still am in love with this
movie its great and very funny.It stars rappers Kid 'N' Play who were very
famous back in the late 80's and 90's.This story is actually about Kid he
lives with his Father who he calls "Pops".One Day Kid asks can he go to his
friends Play's house for a party(since Play's parents is gone out of town
but Pops doesn't know that).He let's him go until he gets a letter from
school that Kid was involved in a fight so he reconsiders and grounds
him.Kid then decides to sneak out the house since the party was going to be
big and his friends were going to be there.But what he doesn't know is what
dangers he's going to find when he gets back home.This Movie is rated R but
this is more like a Teenager movie since the setting of the movie finds all
the charcacters in this story in High School.It's a excellent movie and
great
storyline and very Hilarious.This Movie gets 5 out of 5
stars.

I never was a big fan of rap or hip hop music, but nevertheless
this is a very funny and fresh film about a high schooler's night at a
local
house party, despite his father's objections.
Robin Harris had died just a few days after I first saw this film, and
walks
away with every scene he's in. Funniest lines:
"Don't ever commit a crime with that jeri curl on your head. They'd just
follow the drip!" and "I'm from a small town called
Fresh off a Cops Ass, and you're making me homesick!", to a couple of
policemen. Stay tuned to the extremely hilarious finale where Harris has it
out with his son.
<|_=00=_|>

House Party is sort of like a urban take on Risky Business in the sense
that
boy has party when parents go out of town for the weekend but the
comparison
end there. Kid and Play make one of the first hip hop films of the
nineties
which had a plot. Many young black comedic actors got their start in this
film like Martin Lawerence and AJ Johnson. But the true comedic talent in
the film is the late Robin Harris. The world only knows what Harris could
have done. The script is smart and the direction by Regiland Hudlin is
good.

Oddly serving as the thesis film for director Reginald Hudlin while a
student at Harvard, 'House Party' is one of my favorite teen comedies.
Although, clearly most of the cast (especially Martin Lawrence and the
members of Full Force) who were clearly somewhere in their late 20s, if
not early 30s. However, this is one all-black teen comedy which did
things with just the right amount of spunk, and the characters were not
so obnoxious and not so stereotypical that you couldn't enjoy their
(mis)adventures.

Old school rappers, Kid and Play, are two high school friends. Play is
hosting a house party when his folks go out of town and his number one
mate, Kid, plans on making an appearance. But, after getting into a
scuffle with one of the bullies (aka, the biggest muscles from Full
Force), he gets suspended. Like Les Anderson hoping his parents won't
find out that he flunked his driver exam in 'License to Drive,' Kid
prays that his father won't find out about his getting in trouble at
school because he desperately wants to go that party.

But, more importantly, there is a great mix of subplots interacting
which make this movie quite entertaining, especially the idiotic white
cops that seem to appear at the most inconvenient moments (and not
appear at the convenient ones) to harass the neighborhood and Kid's
father (stand-up comedian, Robin Harris) making his way to the house
party to bring his son home. And get a load of those clothes and
dancing! 

For fans of old school rap and hip-hop: the nostalgia trip alone should
be reason enough to watch it. And, though several House Party sequels
would follow, the first two are really the only ones worth watching.
<|_=00=_|>

very funny, energetic film with a great dance sequence and a really funny
song in the prison. Kid and Play are a  great double act and the writing
is
high quality. I saw a bit of this other Kid and Play film called Class Act
and it wasn't half as good because all the jokes were predictable. You
can't
help but be cheered up by seeing House Party: the ancient, unused condom-
how true.  
<|_=00=_|>

I will never forget the first time I saw this movie. BOOM - this is a real
party movie and the sounds are so great. Then there are the haircuts. You
gotta check out the haircuts! And the wicked funny script. Boys and
girls..... This is entertainment.

House Party was an unexpected low budget hit upon release in 1990,
something about the bright colours and an 'urban movie' without a
single drive by tapped directly into the consciousness of a teen market
wanting desperately to embrace hip-hop culture without getting a gold
tooth.

Kid 'n' Play host their own mega (to them) party. The be-all and
end-all of House Parties. Where they can let their personal freak flags
fly. Where a good time will most certainly be had by all.

And they basically do.

In a lurid blur of motion and colour these attractive teens set about
enjoying themselves in the most PG 13 ways imaginable.

For a 15 year old this was like opening a window to another world: the
outlandish gravity defying haircuts that I envied but would never dare
attempt. The stoopid (in a good way) rhymes and dumb (in a hopelessly
dated now) phrases spouted by these fly guys and home girls were new
and dangerously addictive, if terribly out of place in the small town I
grew up.

Shennanigans were plentiful, but amounted to little more than messin'
playfully with the man in blue, freaking the establishment and clearly
exposing the gaping generation gap by juxtaposing these carefully
manicured teens against the pompous and staid older types.

Characters are broad and never less than frenetic and loud, dialogue
makes little sense but sure sounds fresh and exciting.

And boy are these kids budding model citizens.

Overindulgence of alcohol is frowned upon, but with a supportive
message of limitation rather than abhorrence. Violence is for punks and
drugs aren't even mentioned. Sex is OK but only when 'safe' and
amenable to both parties, no 'c'mon baby, you know you want it' here.

And there is an anti-prison sex rap. Finally someone stands up against
it! 

Final Rating Â– 6.5 / 10. House Party spawned several sequels, none of
which I even vaguely recall. But this 90 minutes is always likable and
elicits warm memories of my teens (not that I acted like this, but I
watched a lot of movies where characters did).

[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!]

Could Kid Robinson's life get any duller? He is constantly under the
watchful eye of his frustrated, over-protective father who is also a
widow, and Kid has no girlfriend. But fortunately his life would get
better for at school that day his friend, Play Martin, was organizing a
huge house party he would be throwing at his house while his parents
were out of town. Their friend Bilal would be the DJ. Kid was
definitely in. They also invite two beautiful girls, Sidney and
Sharane. Unfortunately while Kid was talking to them, he accidentally
bumped into Stab, the meanest boy in school. Stab calls Kid's recently
deceased mother a 'ho and then a fight breaks out. Kid and Stab are
brought before the principal who says she will notify Kid's father. Kid
was worried because he knew for sure his father would say no to the
party if he found out Kid got in trouble at school again. Luckily there
was no letter for phone call from school when he got home. So all
looked well until that evening when Pops received a telegram from the
school. Well that did it. He told Kid that he was forbidden to go the
party; Bilal and his equipment waited on Bilal's porch for Play to pick
them up. Pretty soon Play drove up with his girlfriend, LaDonna. Play
managed to jam all the equipment into his little car, even though the
record players and speakers were scratched up and chipped pretty bad.
But now there was no room in the car for Bilal, so Play decided to come
back for him, much to Bilal's chagrin.

Later that night, Kid crept out of the house while Pops was asleep and
headed for the party. Unfortunately, Pops wasn't quite asleep. En route
to the party, Kid was harassed by two inept, wayward, fascist cops,
Boyd and Warraski. Not only that, but Kid also runs afoul of Stab and
his cohorts Zilla and Pee-Wee. They give chase. Kid hides in the
backyard of a very boring party. But with help from the DJ, George
Clinton, Kid manages to speed up the party. Stab, Zilla and Pee- Wee
arrive then. So do Officers Boyd and Warraski. Fortunately nobody at
the party pressed charges but the officers felt it was their civic duty
to publicly humiliate the boys before letting them go; Play finally
returns to pick up Bilal who decided not to go to the party until he
saw all the beautiful girls in the back of Play's car. The party was
already underway by the time everybody arrived. Play's friends Groove,
Chill, Clinton, Benita, La Shay, Herman, and more. Sidney and Sharane
were there too. It was to be the biggest house party the block had ever
seen. This annoyed the neighbor next door who called the feds; Kid and
Play have a rap contest to one another. Kid really played Play. Bilal
wanted to dance with Sidney, but she refused because she said Bilal had
bad breath. She wouldn't even dance with Kid or Play. But Sharane did;
Stab, Zilla and Pee-Wee arrive then. Play does not allow them into the
party and Kid taunts them from inside. Stab grabs a can of gasoline and
decides to burn the house down. Luckily before he got the fire started,
Officers Boyd and Warraski arrive then. The jig was up.

Pops Robinson headed out to look for Kid. He was also stopped by Boyd
and Warraski. But they left when he told them he was from a town called
"Fresh Off A Cop's 'arse'" and was feeling home sick. Pops soon arrives
at Play's house. Fortunately Kid was upstairs with Sharane (who was
getting her coat). Sidney didn't let him upstairs, so Pops went home to
wait for his son; Kid walks Sharane and Sidney home. He doesn't get
very far with Sharane, and Sidney didn't want to rush into a
relationship. However five minutes later they were up in the bedroom.
While they worried about birth control, Sidney's parents came home. Kid
escaped but was soon left at the mercy of Stab, Zilla and Pee-Wee, who
had just gotten back from being victims of police brutality. They give
chase. Kid hides in an old refrigerator (don't try this at home!) The
wayward cops return and arrest all four of them. In the jail cell, Kid
calls Play and asks him to bail him out, and quickly, as Kid's
cellmates eyed him hungrily; Play was very frustrated with the party's
results, because on top of everything, someone broke his toilet! But
together with Bilal, they got some money together to bail Kid out of
jail. Sidney and Sharane even helped. At the jail, Kid managed to delay
his cellmates with a rap song. Finally he is bailed out. They drop
Sidney and Sharane off at home, then Kid is dropped off. He crept back
into the house and just as he was climbing into bed, there stood
Pops... Belt in hand.

House Party is a pretty funny movie. It ISN'T a stoner film, like it
may sound. Nobody uses drugs in the movie. Heck, nobody even smokes a
cigarette. That's good. I don't even recall if there was any alcohol.
This was one of the good kind of parties. Rap artists Christopher Reid
and Christopher Martin are Kid 'N Play, as credited. Fellow rap artists
Paul Anthony, B-Fine and Bow-Legged Lou play Stab, Zilla and Pee-Wee.
Robin Harris plays Pops and unfortunately, he has passed away. He died
in mid-1990 after completing this film. Too bad, because he was very
good. House Party was followed by many sequels. House Party 2 in 1991,
House Party 3 in 1994, and House Party 4 in 2001. I wonder if there
will be a House Party 5. If so, I'm sure a lot of TODAY'S fine rap
artists will be in it. But for right now, I recommend y'all check out
House Party! It's dope! It's hip! It's the hype. It's ALL THAT. Know
what I'm sayin'? Oh, and Martin Lawrence is here too! So you know it's
good! He was banned from SNL. So check out House Party! There's
actually not as much pervasive language as you might expect. It is
pretty tame for its particular genre. See it today, homes!
