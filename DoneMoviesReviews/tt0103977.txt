Trisha Todd's portrayal of Claire is agonizingly realistic. As the movie
opens we see her in turmoil, clearly dissatisfied with her inability to
find
personal peace. Her life is lived superficially to this point. She
reluctantly accepts an invitation to a writer's retreat and is thrown
into
sharing a room with a psychiatrist. When she later learns that her
roommate
is a lesbian, Claire begins to explore the possibilities of intimately
connecting with others in ways she never imagined before. The interplay
between Trisha Todd's Claire and Karen Trumbo's Noel is so much like real
life in it's awkwardness. I highly recommend this for anyone that
considers
themselves a romantic. It is a classic lesbian chic flick.

Yes, the women in this movie are talky, but hey, they are writers and
words are their medium. Given also that they are mostly graduates of
the 70's and 80's the sexual politics/gender clashing thing makes
sense.

Someone in this list of comments says that Todd and Trumbo are wooden.
Compared to what? Yes, Trumbo's character is reserved, but we see her
relaxing as her clothing relaxes -the long coat gives way to sweater.

There is a scene early in that shows the problems associated with low
budget- Claire goes to the motel and is greeted by someone. The
greeting came off like a question "Hello?" instead of "hello". But by
that time I was in awe of Ms. Todd's presence driving the car, sitting
on the rocks. I rather thought that the camera was in love with her,
following her every movement. And as for wooden, I would say she was
fluid and graceful conveying a character in conflict without
histrionics. Different strokes.

A good budget, some retakes and tweaking the dialogue all could help,
but for a movie that seemingly came out of nowhere it is rather
remarkable.

I must say the first time I saw this movie was way back in 1997.  When I
saw
it then I almost wished I'd not bought it.  I was desperate for something
to
watch one weekend and pulled out the old dusty VHS tape.  I watched it
again
and realized the acting may have not been the best, but i'm sorry Trisha
Todd is a very sexy woman. Even w/ 10 years added i'm sure she is still a
very sexy woman.

I went out and bought the 10th Anniversary DVD to see what else there was
to
see.  Much to my amazement there were MANY scenes deleted.  After I saw
the
making of the movie somehow a lot of other things made sense.  In my
personal opinion the producers/directors of this film should have left in
much that was removed.  I'd personally like to see the WHOLE movie with
all
scenes that were shot left in.

All in all a good, sensual movie. I know I'm certainly in the minority
having this opinion.... Trisha Todd is just too hot to be
overlooked.

The first 45 min of this movie is straight out of Murder She Wrote
style of directing and acting *Rolls Eyes* Hence only a 7 vote for
me... However - skip past the first 45 minutes of plain bad acting,
directing and script etc etc etc and the remaining hour is actually
well worth the watch! The plot will not suffer any for skipping this
first 45 min - indeed this would have been better as a short movie.

Directed by a lesbian this movies has some good stuff to say about both
hetero and lesbian relationships and the dynamics of each from a
woman's perspective. It was all good sound stuff and I found it thought
provoking and it held my attention. The romance and seductive scenes
are also quite sensuous and 'worked' for me *smile* They show how a
lesbian relationship may grow and develop for a hetero woman who has
become bored of men being so 'easy' when it comes to sex. She finds
that her 'power' simply doesn't work that way when it comes to women.
Lesbian relationships being based upon very different dynamics to those
of hetero relationships...

Hope you enjoy this movie too. :o))

When I first bought this movie I wasn't sure what to expect.
I did find it to be ho hum for the first 20 minutes or so but then I
really
got into it. I liked the story line and that it wasn't all sex scenes,
till
the end.
Needless to say I fell in love with Trisha Todd. She's
gorgeous.
For a low budget movie I thought it was made in good taste.

I have heard that this is one of those films that you either love or
you hate. I personally thought it was a very thought provoking film,
especially considering the time and budget. It is sweet and sensual and
makes you think. If you are just looking for steamy sex scenes then
you're in the wrong place. This is a meaningful story of two women
struggling to find themselves. Nicole Conn challenges several difficult
issues with intelligence and grace. In my opinion it was well cast and
the cinematography is impressive considering its Ind status. I highly
recommend this film for a quite night at home. PS The soundtrack is
absolutely amazing. One of my favorite classical play lists.

Set in a women's writing retreat in Oregon, Claire of the Moon begins it's
long and tedious journey.  The first time I saw the movie, all I could think
is, "When are they going to do IT?", but when I saw it for the second time,
I got the message Nicole Conn tries to convey.  Buried under the rather
stiff acting of Trisha Todd and Karen Trumbo (and for that matter, all the
other actors in this movie) is the most complicated problem in any
relationship:  exploring intimacy.  The intentions are good for all involved
in revealing Clare and Noel's fear of intimacy, but poorly followed
throughout the tale.  Conn tries too hard to make this view analytical and
intelligent but succeeds in making it so intelligent that it becomes
tiresome.  Not that I did not like this movie; I did.  But I endure this
movie only for the final scene.  The end leaves us wanting for the real
story to finally begin, but it is too late...the movie is over.  Now for the
confession:  I really like this movie, but only with a grain of salt, and
that is how it should be viewed.

This is an intelligent movie about two likeable, honest (as much as they
can
be as their characters evolve) women who meet as roommates at a writers'
retreat.  One is 'straight,' albeit unsettled, while the other is 'gay,'
but
hasn't met her match either.  The movie consists of believable dialogue,
superb acting, and good supporting actresses.  I enjoyed the movie and
highly recommend it to those who want a true plot, rather than a 'jump in
the bed, dyke movie.'

This was a wonderfully done sensual and seductive movie.  I first saw it a
few years back and was mesmerized by the playfulness of the words of the
two
main characters, Noel and Claire.  Playfulness of course then leading to a
wonderful development of their relationship.

I've since bought the video, and musical score.

I find the film hauntingly erotic.

At First, the story was boring then I started to understand some
behavioral responses associated to such situations. The writer of this
film was able to convey the message that these characters portrayed.
There was passion and fear to break one's own boundaries. Communication
varies in different levels and wavelength. Claire(Trisha Todd) and
Noel(Karen Trumbo), were able to find how to deal with their
differences out of communication. Claire discovered that she's falling
for (lesbian psychiatrist) Noel and so was Noel, who both were scared
to get into. Noel refused to break her rule about getting involved with
straight women. Claire may just be curious about such kind of
relationship initially but the passion got real and strong. Great
story. I suggest that you watch it.
