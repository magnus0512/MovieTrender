I just rented it again.  I just ignore the plot porcupines and enjoy the
adolescent romp.  Perfect family viewing; some action and suspense, no
violence, and just one kiss.
For those of us that will be forever planet bound, it is sometimes nice to
dream.

It's Fun. It's as simple as that. The premise is not actually to far
fetched. Who hasn't thought about going into space? And in this the kids get
to do it. There are a few "you did it because you're a team" slushy American
moments but otherwise it's a great harmless rainy day movie.
8/10

"This one time at space camp...." Ahahaha...ahem...oh well. Down to
business. Participants in NASA's real life Space Camp can undergo a
limited version of real astronaut training. Well for a few of them the
training gets a little too real. Lea Thompson, Kelly Preston, and some
teen age punks are accidentally blasted into space, along with
astronaut Kate Capshaw. You'd think being stuck in space with those
three ladies would be a fantastic weekend, even with Joaquin Phoenix
along as a whiny brat. Well it is, until the oxygen starts to run out.
Whu-Oh! Luckily Tom Skerrit is on the ground to help out.

This is a fun little movie meant simply as family entertainment. Of
course it has technical inaccuracies, it's a movie about kids being
launched into space. I just don't understand people who rag on it
because some aspects aren't technically correct. This isn't a NASA
training film, it's just an exciting little film that a family can
watch together. It also stars Larry B. Scott, who also played Lamar in
Revenge of the Nerds, and Terry O'Quinn, who played Locke in Lost.

Impossible? Of course it is, but 'Space Camp' is a good 'ol piece of
wide-eyed, optimistic 80s feel-goodery. God, I miss it. But revisiting
it turned out to be more than a mere nostalgia trip. 'Space Camp' is a
well made, well acted, adventure film that deftly mixes comedy, drama
and thrills.

Featuring a cast of talented and likable actors that you will recognize
from better known films, top notch special effects and a rousing score
by the great John Williams, 'Space Camp' is the type of film that
today's kids need to see. Its message? Work hard, dream big and reach
for the stars. It's a lesson they're not getting from our popular
culture today, and it's one they desperately need to hear.

I love this film. It is a fun filled adventure about a group of
teenagers who attend NASA Space Camp to learn how to be astronauts.
These teenagers include Kathryn an ambitious girl (played by Lea
Thompson who played Marty's mother in the Back to the Future films),
Tish a blonde haired and semi-Valley Girl with a photographic memory
(played by Kelly Preston who has been married to John Travolta since
1991), Kevin an arrogant teenager who gradually learns about
responsibility, Rudy a bright African-American teenager and the
intelligent 12 year old Max the youngest of the group. (who is played
Joaquin Pheonix in his acting debut, back then he was credited as Leaf
Phoenix). The teacher of this group is Andie Bergstrom (played by Kate
Capshaw best known for playing Willie Scott in Indiana Jones and the
Temple of Doom and has been married to Stephen Spielberg since 1991). 

These enthusiastic space students have a lot to learn at Space Camp. At
one point they have trouble simply getting along with each other. But
their biggest challenge is when they are accidentally blasted off into
space on board the Space Shuttle Atlantis. If they are to return to
Earth they must work together as a team and work like real astronauts.
It becomes a matter of life and death as if they don't succeed they'll
never return to Earth. 

Although the film is fictional, Space Camp does include scenarios that
real astronauts have to deal with when they are blasted off into space.
So Space Camp is a great film to watch if you wish to learn about what
you need to learn to become an astronaut. 

Overall, Space Camp is a very enjoyable movie and I recommend it to
anyone.

Four teenagers (Lea Thompson, Larry B. Scott, Kelly Preston and Tate
Donovan) and one pre-teen (Joaquin Phoenix) get launched into outer space
by
a small robot in this above-average adventure movie. Kate Capshaw is along
for the ride as the instructor and Tom Skerritt is solid as the one in
charge of mission control when the crisis occurs. With the exception of
Scott, the other four young stars have all had recognizable careers.
Joaquin
Phoenix, in particular, steals every scene as the youngest of the five.
3.5
out of 5 stars.

If you want some fun for a couple of hours, you will get it. No
violence, no moral lessons and nice scenes specially for those who are
interested in space stuff. 

This movie also feeds the curiosity of many people about a space
shuttle trip, but the problem is that it was released a few months
after the Challenger disaster, a sad coincidence. Of course, this
episode contributed for a bad performance on the theaters even being
pushed back months.

Don't expect too much in terms of plot, although i really think this is
not the more important thing in movies like this one.

A few summer space campers actually were accidently sent into space by a
robot. And the oxygen in ship was running short. They had to sent someone
to
a space station to get the gas tanks, etc, etc.

First of all, this movie's plot is not possible in real life. But it gives
a
warm feelings of anything is possible if you set your heart in.

It is amazing to see those young actors who still look about the same
after
so many years. (I saw this movie for the first time in the year of 2000,
it
was filmed in 1986) There are quite a few people in that movie who are
still
working in Hollywood.

The view was great from outer space. It does not look unreal. It is about
2
hours long, it runs so fast that you won't even notice. You know that it
is
not real, but you just get sucked into it until the end.

Overall, it is a good family movie.

I've watched this more times than I can count, and my family has owned it
since before I can remember. I like this movie for that reason, also it was
the first step towards movies like Apollo 13. Isn't it funny all the future
stars that are in this movie? Kelly Preston, Lea Thompsan (well, she did
already have Back 2 the future) Tate Donovan, Joaquin Phoenix....

Watching this movie again really brought back some great childhood
memories . I'm 34 now, have not seen it since I was 12-14. I had almost
forgotten about this movie, but when I watched it again recently, some
scenes literally brought a tear to my eye! That little robot
"Jinx"(friends forever!). It was just like revisiting my childhood. It
was an absolutely amazing experience for me. I will always cherish this
movie for that reason. I can't believe that was Joaquim Phoenix as a
kid. I'm addicted to 80's movies now. I can't get enough of them.
Thanks a lot Space Camp. Friends forever. Jinx is still the best "80s
movie robot" ever. I named my cat Jinx.
