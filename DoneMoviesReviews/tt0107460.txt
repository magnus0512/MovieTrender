Kung Fu Scholar is a comedy action starring Dicky Cheung. He wants to
learn kung-fu, but his mother wants him to go to school. After losing a
game with his mother, he's forced to attend school. Liu Sin-Hoi (Aaron
Kwok) also attends the same school. The school's headmaster (Mau Tat)
has a niece Ching Ching (Chow Wai Man) who's also been dropped off at
the school by her parents. School has many regulations: One being you
cannot court a woman. But guess what, it's love at first sight for Man
Chui (Dicky Cheung) when he sees Ching Ching. There's a band of
henchmen after prince eight, and Man Chui and Sin-Hoi gets entangled in
their affairs.

The story is a combination of silly antics, and occasional kung-fu
action. Hong Kong cinema was coming of age in the early '90s where they
maintained constant quality in their production. This movie would have
been a dud otherwise. Aaron Kwok and Chow Wai Man were in their 20s,
and they look great. Part of the attraction of these movies are to see
your favorite stars in action, and this movie is no exception. 

Not a particularly significant movie, but entertaining none the less.
