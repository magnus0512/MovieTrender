Europeans have always delighted in introducing America to itself. (I am
thinking of de Tocqueville and Nabokov.) There is something very
valuable about seeing ourselves through the eyes of others. In Atlantic
City, assumptions about the American way of life, the American dream
and the America reality, circa 1978, are examined through the artistry
of master French film director, Louis Malle (Murmur of the Heart
(1971), Pretty Baby (1978), Au Revoir Les Enfants (1987), etc.)

The film begins with a shot of Sallie Matthews (Susan Sarandon at 34)
at the kitchen sink of her apartment squeezing lemons and rubbing them
on her arms, her neck, her face as Lou Pasco (Burt Lancaster at 68)
watches unbeknownst to her from across the way, the window of his
apartment looking into hers. She works at a clam bar in a casino on the
boardwalk, which is why she smells like fish, which is why she is
squeezing lemon on herself to get rid of the smell. She is taking
classes to be a blackjack dealer. Her dream is to go to Monaco and deal
blackjack in one of resort casinos and perhaps catch a glimpse of
Princess Grace. She listens to French tapes and achieves...an amusing
accent. He is a has-been who never was, a pathetic old numbers runner
well past any dream of his prime, pretending to be a "fancy man" as he
picks up a few extra bucks waiting on an invalid woman.

Enter a hippy couple with all their belongings on their backs. It turns
out that he is Sallie's estranged husband, a deceitful little guy who
has found a bag of cocaine that he intends to cut and sell; and she is
Sallie's not too bright sister, very pregnant. They need a place to
stay and have the gall to impose on her.

Both Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon were nominated for Academy
Awards for their performances, as was director Louis Malle and writer
John Guare for his script. But none of them won. This was the year of
On Golden Pond with Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn taking the Oscars
while Warren Beatty won Best Director for Reds. (Best film was Chariots
of Fire with Colin Welland winning the Oscar for his original
screenplay.) Nonetheless, Lancaster and Sarandon are outstanding, and
they are both beautifully directed by Malle. Lancaster in particular
demonstrated that at age 68 he could still fill up the screen with his
sometimes larger than life presence. The familiar flamboyance and sheer
physical energy that he displayed in so many films, e.g., Come Back,
Little Sheba (1952), From Here to Eternity (1953), The Rose Tattoo
(1955), Elmer Gantry (1960), to name four of my favorites, are here
properly subdued. He moves slowly and is easily winded. He is a sad,
cowardly old man whom Malle, to our delight, will miraculously
transform.

Sarandon's performance is also one of her best, on a par with, or even
better than her work in Thelma and Louise (1991) for which she was also
nominated for Best Actress and also did not win. She is an actress with
"legs" (this is a pun and an allusion to an inside joke about her
famous other attributesÂ–nicely displayed in Pretty Baby--over which
perhaps too much fuss has already been made!)--an actress with "legs,"
as in a fine wine that will only get better with age. She, like Goldie
Hawn, Catherine Deneuve and a few others, have the gift of looking as
good (or better) at fifty as they did at thirty.

Louis Malle films are characterized by a tolerance of human
differences, a deep psychological understanding, a gentle touch and an
overriding sense of humanity. Atlantic City is no exception. What Malle
is aiming at here is redemption. He wants to show how this pathetic old
man finds self-respect (in an ironic way) and how the clam bar waitress
might be liberated. But he also wants to say something about America,
and he uses Atlantic City, New Jersey--the "lungs of Philadelphia," the
mafia's playground, the New Yorker's escape, a slum by the sea "saved"
(actually further exploited) by the influx of legalized gambling in the
seventies--as his symbol. He begins with decadence and ends with
renewal and triumph, and as usual, somewhere along the way, achieves
something akin to the quality of myth. Even though he emphasizes the
tawdry and the commonplace: the untalented trio singing off key, the
slums semi-circling the casinos where Lou sells numbers, the boarded-up
buildings, the sad, tiny apartments about to be torn down, Robert
Goulet as a cheap Vegas-style lounge act, etc., in the end we feel that
it's not so bad after all.

I should also mention Kate Reid who played Grace, the invalid,
ex-beauty queen widow of a mobster, who orders Lou about. She does a
great job. Her character too will be transformed.

If the late, great Louis Malle was running the world the gross
transgressors would surely get theirs and the rest of us would find
forgiveness for our sins, and renewal.

Louis Malle, his cast, and his location really put this one over. It's
well above the routine. Malle knows how to tell a story conventionally,
without screaming shock effects or outsize explosions or in-your-face
directorial banner headlines. When a pistol is fired, it doesn't boom
like dirty Harry's. It simply pops unobtrusively. It all flows along
smoothly. And it's aptly titled. The story is as much about Atlantic
City as it is about the residents and visitors we meet. It's like a
Robert Altman movie except that it has a fascinating narrative that
draws us in. 

We see the city first. A decrepit faux urban setting whose good days
are long in the past. (Woodrow Wilson used to summer nearby.) It was
called "the lungs of Philadelphia." It boomed as a summer resort before
commercial airlines vulgarized travel and brought Miami and Bermuda
within easy temporal reach of the Northeast corridor. The older
apartment buildings, the ones with Queen Anne towers, are being
demolished, to be replaced by the casinos that everyone assumes will
bring prosperity back. (They never did. The money stayed in the casinos
or went out of state.) But those sturdy old brick palaces were built to
last and the apartments we see are shabby but cozy too. People have
made nests in them over the years. The residents have accomodated their
existences to the frames of the places they live in. People work in
oyster bars, or run numbers in the falling-apart rubbish-strewn black
neighborhoods. They can, if they have the money to do so, dine in
reasonably good restaurants or stroll on the boardwalks, and we can
almost hear the hoofbeats of yesteryear.

What modern Atlantic City is to its brassy past, Burt Lancaster is to
his own history. He stalks the streets in his overcoat, wearing the
only tie he owns, mutters things about how important he used to be,
once having shared a cell with Bugsy Siegal. He used to have to kill
people once in a while, he tells a young man confidentially. He always
felt bad about it afterward and used to take a long swim in the ocean
to feel clean again. "I never saw the Atlantic Ocean until today," says
the kid. Lancaster turns around and looks out to sea and waves
expansively. "You should of seen the ocean then," he says. "The
Atlantic Ocean was really somethin' in them days." His glorious career,
it turns out, has about the same epistemological status as that of the
city he hasn't been outside of for the past twenty years. The Atlantic
Ocean was really somethin' in them days. What a line! And Lancaster
handles it well too. He's no Crimson Pirate here, just a quiet older
guy with curly white hair trying to make a buck by running errands for
small-time hoods, and trying to sell a silver cigarette case, a memento
of his past, for "a double sawbuck." He looks exactly right too. Not
"old," exactly, but well aged, like a mature burgundy. His generously
featured face hasn't drooped with the passage of the years. His
eyebrows are dark and set off his surprisingly gentle eyes. He doesn't
clip off the terminal contours of his sentences, as he did before. It's
a splendid performance.

His performance is matched by that of the other principle actors. There
are some quietly amusing episodes between him and the woman he takes
care of. (There is also a pretty gruesome lethal stabbing, although
without blood.) Only the villains are one-dimensional villains. Susan
Sarandon is marvelous as the young oyster-bar employee who wants to
become a casino dealer, even if it means putting up with hits from the
oily French guy who teaches the fine art of dealing in a school run by
the casinos. He smokes with a cigarette holder and sounds like Charles
Boyer, the swine. What a fine actress she is. Even here, dressed in
threadbare clothes, her skirts around her ankles, wearing clumsy boots,
her hair a mop of Scottish red, she fixes a viewer's interest when
she's on the screen. She's as vulnerable under those oyster shells as
Lancaster is when he discovers he can't protect her from the villains.
And the two of them have a tender love scene together, and later a more
raucous good time. In the end they go their separate ways -- Lancaster
back to his destiny, and Sarandon in search of hers. 

The characters in the film bounce around at first, at odds with one
another, or simply unaware of the others' presence, but Malle draws
them together into a community whose welfare we finally come to care
about. It's a fine movie.

Set in 1970s Atlantic City in the early days of legalized gambling, we find
a young woman (Susan Sarandon) working in the fish section of a casino
restaurant while learning to be a card dealer. At the same time, an elderly,
small-time hood (Burt Lancaster) is stuck taking care of a gangster's widow
(Kate Reid). Sarandon's husband and her younger sister ran off together and
unexpectedly reappear looking for a place to stay. Her sister is now
pregnant and her low-life husband is trying to sell drugs stolen from a
big-time dealer in Philadelphia. Sarandon's husband meets Lancaster in a bar
while trying to set up a deal to sell the drugs, and he convinces Lancaster
to be his "mule."  Lancaster and Sarandon being neighbors -- with her
brother in law as the mutual acquaintance -- are brought together and become
involved in more trouble than they ever thought imaginable.

The refreshing aspect of this motion picture is that it avoids the typical
Hollywood pitfall where character development and dialogue play second
fiddle to car chases and stunt scenes. In Atlantic City the odious
characters and sticky situations are secondary to the development/relationships
of the lead characters.  This is the first excellent performance on film of
a young Sarandon, and one of the finest performances of Lancaster's
distinguished career.

This film has been butchered on cable, VHS, and laserdisc.  Please let's
have a quality remaster on DVD in widescreen format.

In the mid-'70s, Malle embarked upon a decade-long visit to America
where, after 'Pretty Baby,' a sensitive but finally tedious look at
child prostitution in 1971 New Orleans, he makes 'Atlantic City', in
which an aging small-time mobster sees his romanticized memories of
villainy become reality when he acts as father confessor, protector
and, finally, lover to a lonely young croupier... 

Part romantic comedy, part thriller, part fairy-tale, the film is
simultaneously mythic and rooted in reality and charms through its wry
acknowledgment of human delusions and its tender portrait of passion
and dignity regained...

"Atlantic City" received critical acclaim and was nominated for five
Oscars (best actor, best actress, best director, best film and best
original screenplay), although it won none... It was to be Louis
Malle's most successful film...
<|_=00=_|>

ATLANTIC CITY is one of those perfect little movies in which writing,
direction, acting, and setting all come together seamlessly.  The story is a
subtle and wistful blending of comedy and drama that is both true to life
and touching.  There is great resonance between the characters' situations
and the mood of Atlantic City, beautifully captured at a pivotal time in its
history.  Burt Lancaster gives one of the great performances of all time and
really should have won the Oscar.  Susan Sarandon is also superb, and their
scenes together are unforgettable.  Kate Reid as a faded gangster's moll is
a standout in the fine supporting cast.  This is perhaps Louis Malle's
finest movie, and, in my opinion, one of the 10 best movies of the
80s.
<|_=00=_|>
This is a little bit on the seedy side but it's well-done and Burt
Lancaster, once again, provides us with a wonderful character study.
This time he's "Lou Pascal," an old-time small hood playing out his
days in pathetic manner in a dingy Atlantic City. In fact, "seedy"
describes Atlantic City in this picture.

There's nothing seedy about the opening scene, however. It's an
attention- grabber, at least if you're a male. We see Susan Sarandon,
squeezing lemon juice over her breasts at the kitchen window. Later, we
see her do the same thing.

The film is no lemon, however. It's an excellent film and Lancaster,
Sarandon ("Sally Matthews") and her husband "Dave" (Robert Joy)
comprise most the early going. Joy's role as Sally's loser druggie
husband was ugly but he doesn't last long in the film. 

The second half of the film features mostly the two stars, both of whom
were up for Academy Awards for their performance (and lost out in a
sentimental vote for the On Golden Pond crowd). Not only do Lancaster
and Sarandon excel, but so does director Louis Malle.

Malle makes this almost a modern-day film noir with the grittiness of
the characters and the setting, when Atlantic City looked its worst.
It's just solid film-making all-around, and few people could play
intense characters, young or old, as well as Lancaster.

My only regret is the transfer on the DVD. It's a little grainy and
this film deserves better treatment. although, come to think of it -
the grain is appropriate considering it's a gritty story.

Burt Lancaster gives an astonishing performance aching with melancholy
in this lovely, quiet little film by Louis Malle. He plays a one-time
gangster (in his own mind at least quite a big shot) who, like the city
that gives the film its title, isn't what he used to be. Susan
Sarandon, in an early-career performance, plays a woman who works in
one of the casinos and whose life intersects with Lancaster's because
of a drug deal her no-good husband was involved in. The two don't ever
become friends exactly, but they each get something from the other
until the sad ending, when Lancaster realizes that there isn't a place
in his life for Sarandon, and that there may not be a place in the
world for him.

The film is a low-key character study that completely satisfies, and
gives Lancaster perhaps his last great role.

Grade: A
<|_=00=_|>
The setting and the characters are just right for each other. Atlantic
City is undergoing a transformation, with new casinos and hotels
dotting its shoreline while a few blocks in, out of the tourists sight,
the full time residents live in what's left over from the past. Louis
Malle captures it all with this story about a retired small time member
of the local organized crime syndicate (Burt Lancaster) who comes into
a small fortune worth of stolen cocaine when the guy that stole it
(Robert Joy) is killed by the dealers who meant to buy it in the first
place down in Philadelphia, and are now hot on his heels as well. Back
in the life, though unwittingly, he sells the coke to an ongoing poker
game in one of the suites in a new hotel, bit by bit, and falls into
the romance of his dreams with young Susan Sarandon, whom he watched
every night from his hotel room as she bathed her breasts with lemon
juice in her room across the way. Like the refurbishing city its set
in, he feels rejuvenated and in one instance even fearless in the face
of the ruthless Philly dealers. The film put Lancaster back in the
limelight for a while, and refreshingly so. Its gritty realism and
characters, especially Joy, who makes an excellent hippie con-man,
marked the end of an era of that realistic 70's urban crime drama genre
that deftly mixed romance with drugs and violence, and portrayed the
underworld, mostly minus the cops, so well.
<|_=00=_|>
"Atlantic City" is a great film where the setting is just as rich and
complex a character as the people traversing its streets (and
boardwalk). Louis Malle delivers one of the most understated
directorial turns working with a delightfully witty script (that has
many great lines, like the one above) and a great cast (Lancaster
perfect in a comeback role, Sarandon stunning in one of her early great
performances). Things are so subtle here that you don't even realize
you just watched a work of art until it is over. Atlantic City is shown
truthfully (in despair, in shadowed glory, and in the glitz and glamor
that was to return thanks to the casinos circa the late 70's) and the
people inhabiting it gloriously reflect all of those varying degrees.
This is the human condition (searching for that first break or that
last chance) in all its quiet charms.
<|_=00=_|>
"Atlantic City" is overall a well done film that's pays homage to the
city itself and is somewhat a going away present for legendary Burt
Lancaster. The film seems low key though even though drama is present
it's not your typical gangster film of blood and violence and the plot
is pretty simple and not to complex. Burt Lancaster is aging mobster
Lou Pascal who takes care of an aging woman in fact a deceased mobsters
wife, yet Lou is still in the business and collects at random on the
boardwalk. Then enter Sally Matthews(Susan Sarandon) a waitress and
card dealer in training for one of the casinos has her life turned up
when her sister and ex show up from Philadelphia after finding a big
bag of white powder! The paths of all the characters cross, yet as I
said again it's mostly low key most important the relationship of
escape routes develop for the lives of both Lou and Sally upon meeting.
And the scenes of seeing Susan Sarandon wash and bath by rubbing lemon
juice from squeezed lemons was very sexy! Clearly one of the more
erotic memories in cinema history. Louis Malle wrapped it up well by
being low key ending with both male and female lead characters getting
what they wanted escaping to a new life. The scenes of A.C. was great
and to top it all off Burt Lancaster was very classy and smooth in his
performance.
