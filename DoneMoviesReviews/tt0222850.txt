The day I was finally able to admit to myself that I was a gay man I
rented this movie. That first viewing changed my life. It helped me
envision a life a hoped was ahead of me. During my first year of being
out I watched this movie so many times and still watch it about once a
year.

The first time I saw it I thought it was one of the best movies I had
ever seen. Time has dimmed my view of it but it still a must see for
any newly out (newbie) gay man.

The script is well written. Some of the direction is a little off but
it was a low budget film. It is also fun to see all these mainstream
actors like Dean Cain, Timothy Olymphant and Andrew Keegan playing gay.

I know people have their problems with this movie, but I happened to
catch it at the perfect time in my life. I think every young gay male
should watch this movie and see that there is life after coming out.
It's nice to see a gay movie that isn't a GAY movie. The main
characters all happen to be gay, but that is not the focal point of the
movie. There is no sub-plots about AIDS or dealing with same-sex
marriages or disapproving parents. The movie starts when all that stuff
has already happened. It really makes you think. Two thumbs up! The
cast is superb. Although not superstars, the movie has some well
seasoned actors; including Fraiser star John Mahoney. Zach Braff does
an excellent job as does Andrew Keegan, Dean Caine and of course
Timothy Olyphant. Kerr Smith also has a small cameo but well worth it.
This movie begins to break down the stereotypes of gay men and comes up
with some great gay lingo that my friends and I have adopted.

Greg Berlanti's film is worthy of a lot of praise in a society where gay
men
tend to only fulfill certain stereotypes. A character, Howie mentions how
he
would like to see gay men being represented as something other than the
woman's best friend, the hustler, the aids victim or the sex addict and
this
film does tend to try hard to avoid these stereotypes. The script is
brilliantly written and sparkles when it is at its peak. At its worst, it
may be a little bit cliche ridden but hey..it also has originality ( I
have
taken "Meanwhile" and now its commonplace down ere!) and is not afraid to
portray gay men as just a group of lads who are falling in and out of
relationships, liek any other group of young men. However certain
characters
do tend to bring the pace down a little and it does sometimes seem to have
the sentiment that gay men have got it so bad compared to everyone else in
the world. Timothy Olyphant stands out here in an able cast, made up
primarily of TV actors. My only grumble was the inclusion of the lesbian
couple who seemed to only be there to represent the ladies and also to
give
Howie a meatier role. 4/5

The Broken Hearts Club is one of the most genius films I have ever
seen. I love the way each character is conveyed differently, proving
the homosexual male stereotype wrong. This movie is very warm and
heart-felt bringing a connection to the viewer and the characters.This
film is smart, and a well put together comedy that will definitely have
viewers laughing, crying, smiling, fussing, and cheering until the very
end. I recommend everyone have an open-mind and see this film. There
are few films that I would say won my heart after seeing it but The
Broken Hearts Club did just that. This film shows that homosexual males
go through many similar situations that heterosexual males also go
through . This movie sends many different positive messages to it's
audience. I definitely respect this film 100 percent. The Broken Hearts
Club: A Romantic Comdey deserves a standing ovation.

That statement is part of what makes this is a terrific film about love,
friendship and betrayal -- betrayal of friends, the people you are supposed
to care most about and ultimately yourself. This is also a film about
facades, lying and truth telling.

From the opening montage of `Gay or Not Gay' in a supermarket this is a film
with many laughs and people that you want to care about.

A true ensemble cast, ostensibly headed by Timothy Olyphant as Dennis, is
only part of what makes this a fine piece of cinematic
work.

Dean Cain (Cole) as the pretty-boy actor at one point says about his obvious
good looks: Â‘It's my way in ... and then I have to prove if I have the #@%*
to back it up.'  Mr. Cain proves that he does have the ability to back it
up.  

Matt McGrath (Howie) as a man searching for love and doesn't realize he has
it within his grasp, has a Mathew Broderick look that is very
engaging.

The always-interesting John Mahoney is outstanding as the coach of the
`Broken Hearts Club' baseball team that wears the uniform of his restaurant
and bar where the perennially losing team goes after their pathetic attempts
at playing baseball.

Colour becomes a character as embodied by Robert Arce as `Purple Guy.'  He
speaks only once in the film -- but it is worth listening
to.

There are many outstanding actors -- many currently in television series --
John Mahoney (Fraser), Zach Braff (Scrubs), Chris Payne and Ben Weber who
have both done time on `Sex in the City.' But it was particularly nice to
see Jennifer Coolidge who will always be Stiffler's Mom in the `American
Pie' films. Andrew Keegan as Kevin the `newbie' is exceptional -- learning
about himself and life in West Hollywood whether he wants to or
not.

This is very much writer/director Greg Berlanti's film -- these must be
people he knows and so writes about.  At one point one of the characters
says 'they should make a movie about us.'  Well, Mr. Berlanti did and it is
quite an accomplishment because even though the characters are gay the lives
they lead, the questions they ask, the problems they face and the joys they
experience are universal.

THE BROKEN HEARTS CLUB: A ROMANTIC COMEDY (2000)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1

Sound formats: Dolby Digital / SDDS

The lives and loves of an LA softball team, comprised entirely of gay
men.

Greg Berlanti's heartfelt drama seems a little timid in the wake of
confrontational entries like "Queer as Folk", but the former producer
and co-writer of TV's gay-friendly "Dawson's Creek" makes an otherwise
auspicious directorial debut with this familiar account of several gay
friends looking for love and companionship in vanity-driven Los
Angeles. As one character puts it: "Gay men in LA are a bunch of 10's
looking for an 11." 

Essentially the tale of a Queer sports team comprised of staff and
management at a popular restaurant run by elderly patriarch John
Mahoney ("Frasier"), the film's paper-thin narrative is roused by a
combination of lively dialogue and well-defined characters, played to
perfection by a terrific cast, culled mostly from the New York stage:
Ben Weber is the 'Plain Joe' whose inability to attract a boyfriend is
due more to his lack of self-esteem than absence of personality; Dean
Cain (Superman himself!) is a hunky aspiring actor who leaves a trail
of broken hearts in his wake; punk-style Zach Braff portrays a
gym-queen, wilfully blind to the dark side of gym culture; Matt McGrath
and Justin Theroux are ex-lovers who can't seem to let go of one
another; and Andrew Keegan is the cute new kid who stumbles into this
disparate group whilst struggling to come to terms with his burgeoning
sexuality. The unofficial pack-leader (Timothy Olyphant) is smart and
sassy, and increasingly aware of the personal opportunities he's
sacrificed in his relentless pursuit of casual sex with strangers.

The actors invigorate a fairly routine scenario, though Olyphant (whose
demonic good looks have typecast him in too many villainous roles)
dominates proceedings as a young man standing at the crossroads of his
life, seeking confirmation of his own personal value. Mahoney is funny,
wise and dignified as the Shakespeare-quoting softball coach, and
Broadway singer-actor Billy Porter gets some of the best lines in a
role that otherwise amounts to little more than comic relief. Beefcake
is provided by supermodel-turned-actor Michael Bergin ("Baywatch:
Hawaii") and Christian Kane (semi-regular on TV's "Angel") in cameo
roles, and the lovely Kerr Smith appears briefly in one of the movie's
best scenes. Watch out, too, for a memorable appearance by Jennifer
Coolidge as a 'helpful' hair stylist who brings the house down with a
single line of dialogue! However, a subplot involving Weber's sister
(Mary McCormack) and her attempts to become a mother with long-term
partner Nia Long is underdeveloped to the point of redundancy (memo to
gay movie makers: if you're gonna include lesbians in these otherwise
all-male offerings, do 'em properly or not at all!), and Cain's
much-publicized 'kiss' with Keegan is coyly hidden by the angle at
which it's filmed, a hideous cop-out (the eminently straight Olyphant
has no such qualms - he kisses his male co-stars with reckless
abandon!). Shot on location by cinematographer Paul Elliott (AND THE
BAND PLAYED ON), the movie has the look and feel of a widescreen TV
show, dominated by closeups and medium shots which invalidate
Berlanti's use of the scope format.

Gay cinema doesn't really need another romantic comedy, but while
"Broken Hearts" doesn't offer anything new, it's salvaged by snappy
editing, a quickfire pace, and first-class performances by some of
America's finest young actors. And thanks to a clever, throwaway bit of
name-dropping, the movie offers fleeting confirmation - at last! - of
the role played by sex-god Antonio Sabato Jr. in the fantasies of
hormonally-charged gay teenagers everywhere! Been there, done that...
<|_=00=_|>

Quick evaluation:  this movie does reflect my experiences of the past 25
years.  As a nearing-50 gay man, I can relate to nearly all the principal
characters, both personally and as they relate to my friends and
acquaintances.  Yes, at various times in my life I've been the cute,
promiscuous one; the lonely one; the gym bunny (no drugs, though); the
(self-perceived) ugly one. . .all those have helped me to become a better,
more self-actualized person.  Seems there are too many self-loathing queens
commenting negatively on this film here. . .maybe they can't see themselves
in the characters, but if they were to be honest, they'd realize that they
do indeed exist in one or more of these characters.

I enjoyed the film, laughed a little, cried a little.  As I said, "been
there, done that."
<|_=00=_|>
As a mature (61) gay man, I enjoyed the hell out of this film. At least
there was a diversity of stereotypes. I guess it would be boring to
show that most gays lead "regular" lives in all kinds of workplaces.
The angst was, thankfully, less "Dawson's Creek" and more universal.
The experienced straight actors helped it flow along nicely, a cut
above the usual sloppy, Indie-style gay movie. The Lesbian subplot
should have been expanded--or left out! I recommend this movie to all
young lesbians and gays facing a still altogether ignorant homophobic
society---but one that has improved since I was their age. Kudos to the
people behind the camera too!
<|_=00=_|>

This film gives gay men a meaning beyond stereotypes and the roles usually
seen in gay movies. The theme is universal: friends stand by you to assure
you that you are OK as you are.

Some of the dialog is hilarious, and the characters ring true even though
many of these people are played by straight actors. There is an amusing
glossary of gay terms given on the screen from time to time so that straight
audiences will understand the lingo of the gay subculture.

The touching elements in the film include the loneliness of what one
character describes as "10s looking for 11s." The recognition that a person
can be gay and average is the only antedote for this loneliness.

We follow a group of young gay men, under the matronly supervision of John
Mahoney, connecting and disconnecting as they try to find themselves in a
world that doesn't seem to care who they are. It's a story of human beings.
The fact that they are gay is incidental -- and this is a major step forward
in gays being depicted in movies.
<|_=00=_|>

How un-promising does a gay male Sex In The City sound? This one took me
quite by surprise. It's a frequently very funny romantic comedy, that only
occasionally dips into cliche. Why America remade Queer As Folk when they
already had this is beyond me. Is "Queer as folk" ever an expression over
there? Anyway, this includes Frasier's Dad and Superman amongst its gay
baseball team, so it's good in my book.
