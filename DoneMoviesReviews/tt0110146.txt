***SPOILERS*** Speeding along a lonely stretch of highway outside the
city limits of Vancouver Canada architect Vincent Eastman, Richard
Gere, reaches an intersection on the road as well as in his life as his
car swerves to avoid a stalled van and goes tumbling down an
embankment. Vincent's life goes flashing before his eyes as he as well
as us in the audience see the events over the last few years that lead
to what just happened to him.

Married to his boss' daughter Vincent went far in his father-in-laws
building business but his marriage to Sally, Sharon Stone,had cooled
off over the years. Being estranged from Sally yet working in the same
office with her made life almost impossible for Vincent to take.
Knowing that Sally was living with Richard, David Selby, and having
Richard spend more time with his thirteen year old daughter Meaghan,
Jennifer Morrison, then he did didn't make things better for him
either. 

Having an affair with magazine columnist Olivia Marshak, Lolita
Davidovich, was also taking a toll on Vincent's life since he couldn't
complain about Sally's affair with Richard which really disturbed
Vincent to the point of almost being physically violent towards him.
With a lot of thought and anguish Vincent painfully came to a final
conclusion on what his decision on who to be with, Sally or Olivia, and
puts it on paper. 

Out in the country as Vincent was about to mail the letter to the women
who he was going to spend the rest of his life with something strangely
happened to him. Like a preordained vision that was conjured up for
Vincent by destiny he saw who the woman in his life was to be and knew
now what to do with his life and who to spend it with. Is was then that
fate unexpectedly intervened and made it all right for everyone
involved, Vincent Sally & Olivia, but sadly at the expense of Vincent's
life. 

Haunting eerie and original love story that, despite it's slow pace,
will really move you like it did me and many of the reviewers on the
IMDb in the end. Richard Gere is both sensitive and explosive as the
emotionally drained Vincent who has to make up his mind, to keep from
losing it, between Sally and Olivia but who has his decision made up
for him by circumstances beyond and far out of his control. 

Sharon Stone gives one of her best performances ever as Sally Eastman
Vincent's estranged wife. Sally in the end somewhat realizes the truth
about Vincent's feelings for her but, touchingly so, keeps it to
herself as well as from Olivia. And Lolita Davidovich is both sexy and
caring as Vincent's lover Olivia. Who unknown to Sally knows what
Vincent really felt about her after he wrote, what turned out to be,
his last will and testament which Sally quietly ripped up and threw
down a storm drain as the movie ended.

As a consummate and long-time fan of Richard Gere's, this was a 'must
have' for me and the acquisition was not a disappointment. As usual,
Richard gave an excellent performance, for which I am never
disappointed. Sharon Stone and Lolita Davidovich were great choices for
the female characters and effectively displayed the contrast between
the personalities of the women. This movie contained real aspects to a
person's dilemma's in relationships...from a sterile, business
'association' with his first wife to a passionate and truly loving
'real-life' affair with the woman he met in a chance encounter. The
drama of the accident was well done and suspenseful. In the end, the
most touching aspect was that neither woman wished to hurt the other by
disclosing what they each believed to be true - both were loved and
wanted. I enjoyed it very much and it is a much-watched movie in my
home with all actors performing excellently. I would recommend this to
anyone who enjoys a love story which is true to real-life.

This unpopular film showcases wonderfully nuanced performances that flesh
out a simple story with an interesting twist. Multiple flashbacks (or
shifting timescape) delineate the story, making for a complex movie, but the
patient viewer is rewarded in the end.

Richard Gere, Sharon Stone, and Lolita Davidovich breathe life into the
three corners of a love triangle. Stone is especially good as the
calculating Sally, whose formidable personality holds together only at the
fast pace of high-end social and professional success. Gere manifests the
ambiguity of a man who must choose not only between women but between parts
of his soul. Spirited Davidovich is very appealing as a vital woman deeply
connected to fundamental contentedness and freedom.

Some philosophy is in order when considering this intimate, thoughtful film.
It portrays various aspects of the human condition without embodying them.
For instance, Richard Gere plays a man in the grip of profound indecision,
but director Mark Rydell's hand is sure and his intent clear (`Whatever
you're going to do, do it!'). The movie compresses the many small but
meaningful moments that make up a lifetime into a taut montage of images
flashing before the viewer's eyes, evoking the close link between life,
time, and death. It shows how the simplest, smallest gesture can trigger an
epiphany of profound meaning as someone struggles to find clarity in their
life. Best of all, the movie illustrates how, even in tragedy, everyone can
come away with something positive worth clinging to, whether it's a message
on an answering machine, a hurtful letter undelivered, or a plunge into the
depths of peace.

I thought this film was quite good, not slow or dull by any means. It's
as solid and entertaining as most "top rated" modern films of similar
genre. Maybe a bit too subtle for some people? There seems to be a
problem with shortening attention spans.

There is a well controlled air of the unknown through the whole thing.
The rain-soaked scenery is compelling, the acting is realistic and the
final sequence is powerfully done. You never quite know what's going to
happen, which to me makes a good film.

Did it get bad press before it was even released? I think people
sometimes go in with a bias that has no explanation. Theaters
themselves can spoil movies by way of unruly viewers and other
distractions. Just going to the wrong place on the wrong night can give
a movie a bad rep. Get a big screen TV or projector and tune all that
out.
<|_=00=_|>

I'm not quite sure what this movie's about.  I'm not saying that I suspect
that I missed some deep, subtle secret concealed within the narrative that
only a select few will ever grasp (this, I assume, is true of the alleged
comedy that I've missed in various 'comedic' films) -- rather, I'm just not
entirely sure that this film delivers what it might have had it had a more
coherent flow and some semblance of actually going anywhere.  Not that that
sentence that I just penned is a great example of those qualities, but I
digress...

The movie features fine performances from all involved, including Lolia
Davidovich and Sharon Stone and the pretty-much-always excellent Richard
Gere.  Gere's character is convincing and real, but perhaps a tad too real
because he's a pretty wishy-washy fellow and his is not the most compelling
of roles.  Then again, neither is anyone else's, really.  The two female
leads get marginally more to wrap their skills around, but the whole is way
less than the sum of its parts.  

A 98-minute film, "Intersection" seems a lot longer and I found myself
calculating time-elapsed and time-remaining at more than one point.  Hardly
a good sign.  Sure, there are no Ramboesque explosions and car chases
(though a high-speed driving theme is at the movie's heart) but I'm not the
type of male who has to have that kind of thing to keep me engaged.  A story
might be nice, though.  I mean, a story that hangs together.  In the absence
of much direction, and in the presence of multiple and confusing layers of
flashback, the actors' great work is sabotaged.  It just doesn't really seem
to go anywhere.  

When the film finished I felt the sentiment echoed in that old Peggy Lee
song..."Is that all there is?"  And I don't like Peggy Lee, darn
it!

<|_=00=_|>
I'm not sure what it takes to be critical of a movie like this. Maybe
it's inexperience in life. SPOILERS: Maybe if you've never lost a dear
love and don't know what it feels like to have your knees buckle when
told they are dead, you wouldn't appreciate the emotion and acting that
is conveyed in this script. Also, I never considered this to be a
boring movie at all. It's a love story. It had a three tissue ending,
but I don't consider that to be a downfall. Richard Gere and Sharon
Stone are great. I've seen this film three times now and still think
it's a strong 9 out of 10! Don't avoid it because of the negative
reviews here. Give it your own scrutiny.

Richard Gere stars in this American-made remake of the 1970 film Les
Choses de la vie of French Director Claude Sautet based on the novel by
Paul Guimard. This time around Mark Rydell, who enjoyed success with On
Golden Pond, Cinderella Liberty, The Rose and The Reivers among others
is the director. Sharone Stone, Lolita Davidavich and Martin Landau
round out the cast but this is clearly a Richard Gere film. Although
I'm generally not a fan of Gere he is excellent in this. This does have
the feel of a European film and although I've never seen the original I
would like to. I'd likely find it better as a whole. This is a good
drama and although not a big movie it has a good look to it. I would
give this a 7.0 on a scale of 10 for it's likable story and performance
by Richard Gere,
<|_=00=_|>
This film is a vastly superior remake of a French film called "Les
Choses de La Vie" by Claude Sautet starring Michel Piccoli and Romy
Schneider. I had known the original film for many years because of its
theme music....which is absolutely magnificent, and composed by
Philippe Sarde. The film itself is really a load of slow, boring and
tedious crap ........a car accident is repeated in slow motion I don't
know how many times but enough to drive one mad on that score alone !
Also it was very repetitive and had little deep character development.
In short, its saving grace was its soundtrack !!!

Intersection, on the other hand, which I saw when it came out in
Cinemas in France and subsequently bought on DVD has always been a
great favorite of mine ! So much better than the Les Choses de La Vie
that to compare the two is, quite frankly, a total waste of time. To be
truthful, when I saw Intersection, I did not make the connection with
Les Choses de La Vie, such was the greatness of Intersection compared
to the banality of the other film ! It's only by reading about the film
that I discovered this.

From what appears to be a relatively limited plot, we have magnificent
performances from the three principal actors, especially the two ladies
! Of course the red-haired Olivia Marchak was an absolute beauty, but
even Sharon Stone, whom I don't usually like in films, had something
attractive about her ! Gere had a weak, cowardly and annoying character
( I don't like seeing people cheat on their wives ) but I must admit he
played the part very well. I was especially subdued by Olivia, both by
her physical beauty and here quasi-unflappable character in what could
have been tense situations.

The final fifteen to twenty minutes of the film is the best part
because ......you know it's going to happen .....but you don't want it
to ......but it's destiny. I liked the bit about the letter he wrote to
Olivia but never posted plus the message he left on Olivia's ansafone
but where SHaron Stone came by accident into possession of the letter
which was written but never posted. All that really got to me at the
end and filled me with a strange emotion somewhere between happiness
and sadness and is very difficult to describe. By this deft twist of
the plot, each of the Ladies believed he loved ......her !! An
excellent way to finish the film.

I have watched the film four or five times and each time I am filled
with the same emotion .....so there must be something there !

*** WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILERS *** 

Like many other reviewers, I have a tough time seeing how people can
rate this film poorly. It's well written, well acted, and well filmed.
Some jaded, adrenaline-addicted viewers might find it slow and
uneventful. But in reality, the film is emotionally complex, and it
reveals itself gradually, in multiple layers, requiring patience on the
part of the viewer to appreciate it fully.

Much has been made of how this film is about the main character
Vincent's choices. The first time I watched it, that's what I thought
too - and yes, I did feel a little ripped off discovering that in the
end, it doesn't really matter what his choice is.

That's when I realized that this film is about much more than "just"
the main character. EVERYONE in the film has choices - difficult
choices - to make. There's a reason for the film's name. Vincent is the
intersection point of everyone around him, and this story is about how
everyone else is affected by the situation just as much as it is about
Vincent himself.

On the first viewing, I enjoyed the film primarily for Richard Gere's
haunting, understated portrayal of an emotionally tormented, burned out
man struggling to navigate his way through life so that he gets what he
wants and needs without hurting the people closest to him - and
becoming emotionally paralyzed when he realizes that it's impossible,
leading to tragic consequences.

It isn't until the last scene that the film reveals its true focus.
Only then does the viewer realize that the story's preoccupation with
Vincent - even the accident itself, playing out in slow-motion over the
course of the film - is nothing but a clever distraction, designed to
divert the viewer's attention so that the final scene is even more
unexpected and powerful. Stone and Davidovich both turn in brilliant
performances, and their confrontation absolutely crackles with
emotional tension. It took a second viewing for me to fully appreciate
the depth of their performances, and see everything that leads up to
that final moment. 

Because in the end, that's what really made this film work for me. It's
not about Vincent, because his choice is rendered tragically pointless.
He is merely the catalyst. The film's true focus is on the choices of
Vincent's wife and mistress, and what they decide to take away from
their relationships with him. The film's suspense doesn't come from
Vincent's fate; it comes from knowing that Sally and Olivia both have
the power to hurt each other deeply, and wondering whether or not they
will choose to use that power.
<|_=00=_|>
The movie has a nice point and counterpoint about it. This movie and
Gere's Unfaithful are sort of bookend pieces to each other. As Crash is
to Grand Canyon. Guys will pigeon hole this as a chick flick. If you
are not going to WATCH CLOSELY you will miss a lot esp towards the
ending of Intersection.

SPOILER here

Vincent Eastman (Gere) can not seem to choose between two women. This
is "what I have been doing and what those around me want me to do"
versus "going after some one that will make me happy" stuff. His scene
with the little red haired girl (2/3 of the way thru) is wonderful.
Finally his decision is really made. On the way to his new life he
reaches the intersection....

The James Newton Howard score is terrific, and sadly, just try finding
it anywhere! 

This movie and Gere's 'Unfaithful' are sort of bookend pieces to each
other. As 'Crash' is to 'Grand Canyon'. Guys will pigeon hole this as a
chick flick. If you are not going to WATCH CLOSELY you will miss a lot
esp towards the ending of Intersection.
