This is one of my favorites.  So much so I ran out and purchased it. I'm
puzzled as to why this movie was not rated higher, it is at least on a parr
with DAVE, NINE MONTHS, GROUNDHOG DAY and THE BIG LEBOWSKI.  I liked all
those movies and CAPTAIN RON is just as good.  Kurt Russell's performance is
hilarious and keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what he will do
next.  I would never have seen this movie based on the score it was given,
lucky for me I saw the movie first.  Terrific, hilarious and enjoyable
entertainment.  Don't miss this one.

Captain Ron was released in September of 1992, it had to compete with
movies
like Encino Man, Lethal Weapon 3 and The Crying Game. I think this may be
the reason that it did so poorly at the box office. I saw the film when it
was initially released in theaters, I thought it was great! Very possibly
the funniest film of 1992... So why has it disappeared? Why has no one
ever
heard of it. Go rent the video, or better yet BUY IT, judge the movie for
yourself, and then write Disney, Touchstones parent company and tell them
that this movie really deserves more than just a lousy $10 video release,
when is it gonna be on DVD? How about a CD soundtrack? What went
wrong??

This is wonderful movie, one of my favorite movies of all time! A
family inherits a sailboat and decides to flee the urban rat race. They
don't realize that they will have to over come many hurdles, including
aspects of them selves, Capt. Ron, the boat and the environment.

The daughter plays a teenager that is simultaneously apathetic and
nearly out of control. The son is a kid who hasn't taken an interest in
life until now. The father assumes that Capt. Ron can't know anything
while the family begins to believe that it's the father who doesn't
know anything.

This movie was one of the triggers to me moving to a tropical island to
live, oh and to buy a boat.

Kurt Russell is one of those actors that can play a variety of roles, & get
away with it. Action, drama, & comedy. He must of been thinking of Jack
Burton from 'Big Trouble In Little China' & but some of that into this
movie. 'Captain Ron' is a great movie! The plot is simple, & so is the
movie. That is what make sit so much fun. Yes, most of the movie is
translucent, but it works so well. Kurt Russell shines as Capt. Ron Rico,
who has been hired by the Harvey family to be the drive their boat from a
Carribean Island to Miami, FL. While he bumbles from one scene to the other,
Capt. Ron manages to be successful in the end. All of this makes Martin
Harvey(Martin Short) furious, while his family loves Capt. Ron. Lots of
laughs.

Kurt Russell is brilliant as Captain Ron, a rascal and part time sea
captain
adrift in the Caribbean.  Many classic lines, and bits of dialogue
throughout the film.  This is one movie I enjoy watching
repeatedly.
<|_=00=_|>

This film has a little bit of everything in it.  Adventure, pirates, lots of
excitement, and plenty of laughs.  It is one of the most enjoyable movies
I've watched.  If you just want to relax and sit back and laugh, CAPTAIN RON
is a movie you won't want to miss.

Few people like this film as much as my family and I, but we never miss
it when it comes on TV. Perhaps that's because we've sailed the
Caribbean and can relate to the misadventures of the characters in the
movie. It's a terrific family film.

Kurt Russell is hysterical as the one-eyed Captain Ron. Martin Short,
for a change, plays the straight man. The rest of the cast are cute and
funny. 

By the end of the movie, I actually found myself nostalgic for the
sense of freedom and fun that only Captain Ron can steer you towards. I
gave this movie a 9; don't throw me overboard for that!

Ignore all the stuffed shirt, up-tight pinheads who couldn't loosen up if
a gun was held to their collective heads.  Treat this movie as it should
be...FUN!  This is the film that keeps us going through the winter until
sailing season...then we take the video along on board.

Martin Short and Kurt Russell are TERRIFIC together, and Mary Kay Place?
Who'd have known what a versatile actress she is, after all, most of us
only
had Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman to judge her by.  The kids certainly do add
a
fine finishing touch to this hilarious crew.

This movie was not created to win an academy award, it was created to be
lighthearted and fun and it far exceeded that goal.

I don't understand the many poor reviews I have seen from the
"professional reviewers". I think this movie is incredibly funny in a
quiet sort of way. I have seen it many times. It reminds me of the many
Jackie Gleason Honeymooners I have seen over and over. I know what
punch line is coming and I begin laughing before the punch line is even
delivered.

Martin Short is not his usual manic self and this is refreshing. Kurt
Russell is a master as he plays against the heroic roles he has played
so often.

The play of the use of "gorillas" versus "guerillas" is laid back
genius. I saw this movie again last night for the umpteenth time. I
love it!

Every time i want to laugh, when i see this movie on, i catch a
glimpse. This movie is guaranteed to make you laugh. And Mary Kay Place
is such EYE candy for us men. She represents the type of woman we men
would ask to marry. Beautiful yet supportive of her family and
children. However, Kurt Russell steals the show. This movie was a role
reversal where Martin Short is the serious one and Kurt is the
odd-ball. It excellently shows how an outsider can help indirectly to
save a group from its own fears and inadequacies. anyway, you will
laugh your head off. The location shooting was just beautiful - makes
me want to purchase a boat.
