This was a generally fun film that is considered an action movie, and
rightly so, but has its share of good comedy, too. Charlie Sheen showed
he was well on his way to being successful playing comedic roles, as
he's doing on television right now.

Nastassja Kinski plays the typical new young macho-female role that
introduced on screen in the past generation in which females beat up
males. Give me a break! Anyway, I still liked her despite the
characterization. James Gandolfini was the best of the villains, and
also demonstrated how he was about ready to hit the big time, which he
also has on TV with The Sopranos. Christopher McDonald was another
villain in here but was stupid, not fun to watch. He was angry all the
time and his bleached hair looked ludicrous.

There are a couple of outrageous action scenes in this film, mostly
notably when an automobile with Sheen and Kinski still in it is dropped
from an airplane! Yes, to enjoy this film don't take any of it
seriously! It's simply fast-paced entertainment. For that, it gets a
good rating.

This film was much better than I expected it to be. Its a very enjoyable
fast paced action film, which doesn't take itself to seriously, with an on
form Charlie Sheen, a beautiful Miss Kinski and the added bonus of a
pre-superstar James Gandolfini. Its actually the perfect film for a
Saturday
night with a few beers and Pizza. There are many great action set pieces
and
Charlie has some great one liners too, I mean this isn't meant to be a
work
of art, its a light hearted action film, and it does it well, I'll even
forgive the part that ripped off the ejection seat sequence from Die Hard
2,
after all Goldeneye done it too!

The bad wrap this movie seems to have here is in my opinion a bit over done.
Terminal Velocity is not a bad action movie. Actually it's pretty damn good.
Over the top at times, but still very good. And by over the top, I mean some
of the skydiving sequences. For example, the climax where the car drops out
of the plane.. the fall seems to last an eternity. In the end though, stuff
like that really doesn't matter if the rest of the movie is good. Luckily it
is.

This movie is also the last good movie Sheen did up until Being John
Malkovich. And now after Scary Movie 3, maybe in time he'll end up back in
the big leagues. Terminal Velocity won't change anybody's life, but as said,
it is a good action movie.

Well, some people do like this film, like you Phaithphul Phrog 
here, and I'm quite jaded. From the marvellous, surrealistic 
opening scene, you know you're in for some style, if not exactly 
substance, and you just settle for the ride. Sheen's character 
reminded me of Jackie Chan in his movies : a bit stupid, a bit 
of a buffoon, but realistic and likable. The general good humor 
of this movie also reminds of Chan's recent movies. There is 
action, a bit of violence, but this never turns nasty and 
unpleasant like a Seagal vehicle.

This is one film that has not scored many good reviews, but honestly, I'm a
little surprised why most movie critics has slaughtered this film all
together. Myself, I think that's unfair, cause I found it absolutely
enjoyable. OK, the story is a bit thin at times, but alot of films has had
thinner stories than this one, and still received better
reviews.
Sheen doesn't act too bad in this film either, and Kinsky surprises as
well.
None of them are great actors, but they don't let the film
down.
In general, a fair action-movie, with some very spectacular
skydiving-scenes. Not bad at all.

Skydiver Ditch Brodie (Charlie Sheen) is asked for a lesson. The
beautiful lady (Nastassja Kinski) he takes on the plane seems to fall
to her death as the parachute doesn't open. Brodie quickly finds out
that she is alive and well, and gets into the middle of a conspiracy.
Soon he is chased by secret agents, gangsters, Russians... everyone,
really, and he doesn't know what for. What matters most to this movie
is that it is moving fast, as its title suggested. And "Terminal
Velocity" does well as an action movie with its stunts and explosions,
if you compare it to others of the genre. Also it has a certain sense
of humor because of the unusual situation that the pretty lady
perfectly knows the espionage business, while the hero just follows her
footsteps and even has to ask her how he can fire a gun. It's not a
Bond, but Sheen and Kinski both have much less exciting films in their
biography, so most watchers won't be disappointed.

It's a shame to see Deran Sarafian has ended up directing episodes of TV
shows because he proves with this, his 
best film, that he's a very competent hand at the helm of a big action film.
Admittedly he's helped by the two leads, 
Charlie Sheen and Nastassja Kinski, who have the C-word... Chemistry, not to
mention the villains, James 
Gandolfini and Chris McDonald who have the B-word... Baddy?

The stunt work is both impressive and breath taking because you can see it's
genuine  witness the nail biting 
scene involving a car in free fall  would it be half as exciting if it was
done with CGI? With a script full of great 
comedy moments it all adds up to a very enjoyable way to spend 100
minutes.
7/10

"Teminal Velocity", a B-level action flick with sky diving
as the principle source of thrills, sticks Sheen and Kinski
at the center of international intrigue with sundry bad
guys
chasing them around as they to manage to find ways to free
fall through space and into love. Full of plot-holes, this
typical commercial Hollywood product is a potpourri of
stunts, shootouts, effects, pytotechnics, romance, etc.
sufficient to keep the bleary-eyed channel surfer awake
until the end. The flick has one really cool stunt near
the
end, goes easy on the sex, doesn't take itself too
seriously, and is an enjoyable "ride" as long as
expectations are kept low.

Terminal Velocity is set in Arizona where maverick skydiver Richard
'Ditch' Brodie (Charlie Sheen) takes a job from the attractive Chris
Morrow (Nastassja Kinski) to do a jump with her, however things go
wrong & she falls out of the plane & ends up dead on the ground 1000's
of feet below. Richard decides to do a little investigating & discovers
that Chris is still alive & is an ex Russian KGB agent trying to stop
another ex Russian KGB agent Ben Pinkwater (James Gandolfini) from
stealing $600 million worth of hi-jacked Russian gold & together with
Chris he decides to stop the bad guy's & clear his name...

Directed by Deran Sarafian I actually thought Terminal Velocity was a
decent & enjoyable little action flick. The script by executive
producer David Twohy moves along like a rocket although after the
intriguing set up when Chris fakes her own death it sort of settles
back down into standard action film thriller territory. The film never
seems to take itself seriously & is fairly light hearted with some
amusing one liners coming from Sheen, I loved the 'pack your bags we're
going on a guilt trip' line he comes out with as Kinski tells him about
the hardship Russians have! It's nothing terribly original, it's
clichéd in the sense there are the hero's who eventually defeat the bad
guy's & save the day but it's fun & provides a fair amount of
entertainment if your looking for some light action.

Director Sarafian does a decent job, it's not particularly stylish but
it's well made with some good action scenes. The skydiving stunts are
particularly impressive although some seem a little far fetched
especially the way Sheen rescue Kinski from a car that's been driven
out the back of a plane. There are some neat enough explosions & fist
fights as well.

With a supposed budget of about $50,000,000 it tanked at the box-office
making a paltry $16,000,000. The acting is alright with Sheen making a
likable hero.

Terminal Velocity turned out much better than I thought it would & I'm
struggling to see why it bombed so badly when it was released, anyway I
liked it & thought it was entertaining fun.

I think it was a very interesting film and the main characters were very
good.I don't understand why it wasn't a success according to the critics.
They often give awards worse films too.When I saw it at the first time I
enjoyed it very much.I suggest to everybody to watch it ,but without any
bias.
