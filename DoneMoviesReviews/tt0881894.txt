You have gone through many films like this right from
MGR,RAJINI,KAMAL,JAISANKAR,EVEN GEMENI GANESAN.These films are creating
bad impression on Tamil films.only good thing is no heroine for other
Ajith.I surprised how saran finalized this script.Ajith looks good and
dull sometimes.The reason may be his diet due to his fat look in
previous films.Try to challenge Vijay through Dialouge and songs.comedy
is irritating.songs are not up-to mark.Background score is noisy and
irritating.Sujatha did the same role for many heroes with same
story.Not a enjoyable movie for Ajith fans too.Better next time. my
rating is 3/10
