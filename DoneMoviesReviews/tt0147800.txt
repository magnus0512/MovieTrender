I wanted to see this movie when it first came out but never did. I
didn't get a copy until a week ago and finally watched it with my
girlfriend. I have to admit, I've seen it five times in the past week.
A lot of teen movies have very basic or clichéd plots, but not this
one. It's based on "The Taming of the Shrew" and it has a lot of
interesting twists. The music is awesome, every song actually fits the
moment, and the two love stories are actually interesting to watch.
Even all the actors did a really great job. The only bad thing is the
occasional dirty jokes. If you don't care for teen movies, don't worry,
you are just like me, this movie is still worth watching. I'm giving it
a 10 to bring those ratings up!
<|_=00=_|>

I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Granted I'm just 15 years
old, and also a huge fan of Shakespeare, but it was really a great film.
I
would have to say it's definitely more directed towards the teenage/GenX
generations, but it was awesome.  The tongue-and-cheek Shakespeare
references were great (the "Stratford" girls, etc.) Julia Stiles & Larisa
Oleynik were convincing in their roles, and not to be shallow but the guys
of the movie just all looked really good. =) I recommend this to most
teenage girls, although it's not totally a "chick flick" because my
brother
enjoyed it too.  In any case, the scene with the "Can't Take My Eyes Off
You" ballad at the soccer practice is a can't-miss for all you love saps.
=)
I will tell you right now, the ending IS predictable, but not hackneyed.
It
leaves you with a happy bubbly feeling about teenage love.  Excellent
movie,
that is.  (P.S. When watching this in the theaters-- DON'T leave as soon
as
the credits roll.  There are some hilarious out-takes
afterwards.)
<|_=00=_|>

I can't say enough good things about this movie.  I do remember the first
time I saw it, coming away thinking that I wanted to be just like Julia
Stiles' character in it, though.  She was so cool and did such an excellent
job in her role, that still to this day I consider her to be the coolest
teen in any 'teen movie'. 

Basic Plot: Cameron (Levitt), a new student at Pagua high school, falls in
love with a sophomore named Bianca Stradford (Oleynik). 

However, Bianca has a flirtatious crush on the most popular senior at school
named, Joey (Keegan).  Cameron's sidekick Michael (Krumholtz)tells him, that
Bianca is looking for someone to help her with French and Cameron decides
that's how he'll ask her out on a date.

Kat Stradford (Stiles) is Bianca's sister.  Totally opposite of Bianca, she
is anti-social and is the most feminist high school senior you could ever
meet.  Against boys, dances, and anything having to do with prepiness and
silly fun, she swears off dating and finds herself being accepted to Sarah
Lawrence a college across the country in hopes to get away from her father
and the city she lives in.

Bianca desperately wanting to date, is told by her father (Miller) that she
will be allowed to date when her sister Kat does.  Desperate and not knowing
how to get her sister to 'date for her', ends up asking Cameron, her new
French tutor, to help her with her predicament.
Enter Patrick (Ledger).  An outcast and rumored to have sold his kidneys on
the black market for a new set of speakers, also attends Padgua high, and is
unsuspecting of what will happen soon in his future.

Cameron and Micheal decide that in order to make this work, they need a
backer.  "Someone who's stupid, but has money."  So they go to Joey, telling
him that they know he likes Bianca, and they need him to pay Patrick a tidy
sum, to have him date Kat, in order for him to date Bianca.  What Joey
doesn't know, is that Cameron secretly plans to date Bianca, while he pays
Patrick to take out Kat.

It may sound like a very confusing movie.  But it is so funny, cleverly
written, and not entirely true of American teenage culture, but pretty
close.  The acting is wonderful and in my opinion nothing in the movie would
have worked as well, without the people who played their characters.  As I
said before I think that Stiles' portration of Kat Stradford was right on,
and no one could have done it better.
Her best role, more than certainly, and I love this movie so much!  I would
have to say it's my favorite teen comedy next to The Breakfast Club.  One
the best movies, and a great watch!

I give it a 10 out of 10.  Go rent it, or better yet go buy it!  You won't
regret it!

On his first day at a new school, Cameron falls for Bianca Stratford.
However not only is she popular and beautiful but her father has forbidden
her to date until her older sister does too.  The problem is her sister,
Kat, is negative, bad tempered and unfriendly and certainly undateable.
Cameron seeks the services of school bad boy Pat who he arranges to be
paid
to date Kat and thus allow him to go out with Bianca - but things never go
smoothly when it comes to love.

I'm not a big fan of teen comedies.  They mostly are lame, trading on the
same old plots and clichés that have been around since Animal House and
Porkies.  The recent trend has just seen classical texts adapted giving
rise
to some poor films like `She's all that'.  The plot for this is basically
`The Taming of the Shrew' updated - most of it bares little resemblance to
the play but that doesn't matter - the core is interesting enough to stand
on it's own.  It may not surprise you in terms of who gets which girl and
it's fairly predictable in a romantic comedy type way but that's not
it.

No - the film is funny, lively and pretty enjoyable.  The comedy is built
around the central plot with lots of nice touches and characters that are
genuinely funny, such Mr Morgan and the erotic drama writing headmistress.
The jokes happily never stoop to the gross-out type and this helps it feel
fresh and lively, rather than just scrapping the bottom of the
barrel.

Another strength is that the cast are all very likeable and give good
performances all round.  Compared to the horror or Prince and Lillard in
`She's all that' this was a dream cast.  Ledger is a real up and comer and
he does well here - he doesn't over-egg his bad boy cake and his fall into
love is believable.  Stiles is very cool and better than the teen roles
she
has had of late.  Here she rises above the `outsider' cliché given to her
and does good work - again being a likeable and believable character..
Gordon-Levitt is OK but quite characterless compared to the main two
roles,
likewise Oleynik.  The bets roles are those on the edges and the three
adult
support roles really do well and are very funny -  Janney, Mitchell and
especially Miller on good form.  Gabrielle Union is once again given a
side
role that doesn't play to her strength.  I like her and want to see her in
bigger roles but here she is a `minority face' in a predominately white
film, just as she was in She's All That - maybe I'm being a little
paranoid
but that's what it feels like.

Overall I was taken by surprise as to how funny and lively this film was.
It didn't sink to the gross out comedy of so many teen movies and had
characters and actors who brought spark and energy to the screen.  It may
be
predictable but it works and the jokes and side characters just add to the
sense of fun.  Not brilliant but compared to the mediocre bunch of teen
comedies you COULD watch, this is fantastic!
<|_=00=_|>

A movie like this doesn't exactly hit you over the head with its
originality, and can only be as good as the actors. They must convince you
that you've never seen anything like this before. In this case every single
member of the cast is so good that they sold me on the movie from minute
one.  Heath Ledger & Julia Stiles make a great couple and his rendition of
"Can't Take My Eyes Off of You" was one of the highlights. When Julia listed
the "10 Things" she was crying and I was, too - extremely unusual for me in
a movie like this. Everyone else was just as good and this movie is a
keeper. 
<|_=00=_|>
All the praise in the world goes to every individual involved in the
production of 10 Things I Hate About You,a film that rarely leaves my
DVD player.I'm not a fan of Shakespeare's traditional plays,but the
modern day screen adaptions are brilliant,and 10 Things I Hate About
You is no exception.The highschool stereotypes of the cool kids nobody
messes with,the wannabe's that try too hard to be something they're
not,the geeks everyone picks on and the rebels everyone is afraid
of,mean there's a character in this film everyone can relate to.The
stand out performances are Heath Ledger as Patrick,the
rebellious,feared and elusive bad guy who wins the heart of Kat
Stratford played to perfection by fine actress Julia Stiles who has no
interest in the opposite sex and is perceived to come from the planet
'Loser' while her more sociable,boy crazy sister Bianca (Larissa
Oleynik)hails from planet 'Look at Me,Look at Me'.Her good looks catch
the eye of the smooth,suave and egotistical Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan)
who is a male model,and fights for the affections of the prettiest
Stratford sister with Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) the highschool
geek,with a big heart and a big crush on Bianca.The hilarious Larry
Miller stars as Walter Stratford-the kind of father who puts his girls
on a short leash and desperately tries to shield them from the horrors
of sex,drugs and rock and roll,and of course,boys.A typical teenage
comedy,but its witty dialogue,goofy,sexy,cool and bad ass
characters,and enjoyable storyline set it apart from all the
rest.There's plenty of memorable moments,romance,and clever and classic
lines,all leading up to a predictable but perfectly good ending that
leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling about teenage love.

Based on Shakespeare's "Taming of the Shrew," "10 Things I Hate About
You" offers a refreshing revival of the "good" teen films, as compared
to the "typical" teen films. 

It's based on Shakespeare's story somewhat loosely. It's about a
teenaged girl whose father will not allow her to date. Finally he comes
up with a clever idea - if she can convince her older sister (who is a
strict, boring "b***") to date someone, the younger sibling can as
well. Her father knows this is as realistic as saying "When pigs begin
to fly" but then he can't be accused of being unfair.

"10 Things..." is overall pretty good. It's better than I thought it
would be. It has some funny moments, it's got a talented cast with some
older actors popping up in various humorous roles, etc. It's not as
refreshing or unique as a John Hughes teen comedy but it certainly
plays upon some of the clichÃ©s of the genre (invented by Hughes no
less) to good effect.

Overall, I was impressed with the movie, and the actors, and that's
saying a lot considering it's a teen film (a genre I have come to
loathe recently with entries such as "Slackers" etc.).
<|_=00=_|>

When hiring this movie was first suggested I turned up my nose at it. I
thought, another teenagers flick where the hottest guy in school has to
appreciate a lesser unpopular chick etc etc etc. Since seeing it it has
enterred my all time favourites list. Any old somebody can take the formula
of The Taming of the Shrue and put it into a school yard, and any old
somebody can avoid cle she's in the finer details, coming up with decent
alternatives is the hard part, whatever they did here works like clockwork.
I would easily give it the best teen flick mantle.

Firstly, the acting is perfect, the roles are not overly demanding but
Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger play this to perfection. The supporting cast
is great aswell, there is not a soul that doesn't contribute to the
perfection of it all. Realism is neither what they were really going for
nor
what makes the movie. The language and vocabulary of these kids is
phenominal, words like, Vapid, Pensive, Hanus, Tempestuous, Miscreants.
There are lots of words like these throughout the movie. It is the thing
that does the most to enable adult enjoyment.

For once they avoided the school bully theme, the bad guy in this is just
a model who the chicks like and some of the guys hang with and alot of
others just realise he is a fool. The recessive geek role is this time
given
alot more credibility, he is given the majority of the genuinely witty one
liners and finds a soul mate for himself, instead of them just making it a
joke that he stays a joke. There are a few parts you can really cheer in,
you have to watch it to appreciate them. There is truly never a dull
moment.

The best quote of the whole movie would have to be "it's just an excuse
for all the nerds at our school to rub up against each other to distract
themselves from the pathetic emptiness of thier meaningless consumer driven
lives" that pretty much sums up the purpose of teen parties these days. For
once you actually identify with the "bitch" role in this, both she and the
guy that is falsely pursuing her take a backward step, usually when it
comes
time for the leading man to apolagise for his deceit you really cant
believe
him after they have focused for so long on his efforts, this time for some
reason you do, it fits straight into the story. There is another half to
that situation here aswell but I wont disclose, it is probably the best bit
of the movie.

And the last major point is that this time the father character is a hell
of alot stronger than before, if that had been weak so would the rest of
the
movie have been, but he is not. He has a reason for being there and you
identify with him aswell. It is clear to see they were making the
characters
all strong in thier own right and stronger than the actual
story.

To sum it all up the characters, story and acting are all perfect, adults
can enjoy this one aswell, also because the main relationships are more
stable and adult than the unpredictability of true teenage relationships,
if
they can be called such. So here is the count.

Production Values 2/2, Acting 2/2, Quality and Meaning 1.5/2, Screenplay
2/2, Originality 1/2

Anyone can get something from this movie and most can get alot. This is a
must. For the movie it is I would give it 10 but going by the main
qualities
listed above which all movies can be measured by it would get

8.5/10
<|_=00=_|>

I loved this movie to death, it has the BEST teen cast I've ever seen. Hot
talent, excellent writing, good direction, and a kiss-azz music score makes
this movie able to be watched over and over again. I was so amazed at how
talented the actors were, I just have to tell you what I thought of them
~

First off, I love Julia Stiles as Kat Stratford, Julia is the only blonde I
have ever seen who could probably not pull off a clueless valley girl act
(which is a good thing, trust me, black-haired, brown-eyed girls like me
don't wanna watch dumb blondes.) Joseph Gordon-Levitt is adorably sweet and
lovable here, I just wanted to kiss him. Heath Ledger, i can explain in one
word : hot. And last but not least, Larisa Oleynick was great, very pretty,
and not annoying although some of her dialouge wasn't my style.

Buy it, rent it.. i don't care, just SEE iT !!!
But do keep in mind that I said best "teen"
movie, not best movie. Now SEE iT !!!
<|_=00=_|>
i know that teenage movies are extremely worn out, but this one will
stay hip for ever! i think i will re watch it a hundred times and i
will never get bored! why? because it's super cool!! you have the
adolescents in your normal high-school, and you have the prom and this
cute all-adored babe and this very hot and hip guy is after her but of
course something is in their way: her sister! and we have our normal
constant fight and arguing. but....there is Heath Ledger who is the
ultimate babe and the perfect guy in this movie, and seriously gets you
thinking 'why didn't this happen to me when i was in high school?'.the
story is extremely cute and i think i can say original, anyways more
exciting than the other movies that are in this category. there are
some extremely funny scenes and you will never ever get bored! a
must-see!!!!! and a perfect 10 score!!!!
