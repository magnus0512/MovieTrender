I loved this film.

The Tenenbaum's dysfunction (while amplified for the screen) is quite
an accurate portrayal of family life. Families are, essentially, groups
of people living in each other's pockets, and, invariably, those people
who love you and hate you the most.

Don't get me wrong, Royal and his (thermo)nuclear family of brilliant
buffoons do not represent my family (or any other in the world I
think!) but the family united against a miscreant father is a motif a
lot of people can understand. It is this common humanity that really
appeals to me as a film watcher, and what, ultimately made this film so
very memorable to me.

The ensemble cast is astonishingly proficient. They all lend a perfect
quirkiness to the roles. Anjelica Houston is the perfect former Mrs
Royal Tenenbaum, down to the smallest nuance, Ben Stiller and Luke
Wilson turn in wonderful performances, and this is the only role I've
seen Gwenyth Paltrow in where I actually thought she was someone other
than Gwenyth Paltrow (this is not an insult, it's just that people
don't always do it for everyone, you know...?). Bill Murray, Gene
Hackman, Owen Wilson, all excellent, all the time.

The black comedy counterbalanced with the drama of the issues raised in
this film left me feeling like I'd witnessed a film event, rather than
just another film. I loved every frame of it, from the Baldwin narrated
opening, to the final tying up of ends. It never dwelled on melodrama,
or the more potentially unsavoury elements, and it didn't sink into the
schmaltzy "We all love each other" end it could well have. It began
perfectly, and it ended perfectly.

I can't recommend this movie more highly. It's a must see for anyone
who loves quirky and emotive storytelling, great characters and
beautiful dialogue.

10/10

With 'The Royal Tenenbaums', Wes Anderson turns his lens to the
American family, warts and all. The Tenenbaums are a dysfunctional
family Â– the parents have been separated for decades, and Royal (Gene
Hackman) is a disbarred attorney who has long since moved out of the
family's enormous house (in an unnamed city of course). The children,
all geniuses and overachievers in their own way, are then raised by
Etheline (Angelica Houston), an archeologist. Chas (Ben Stiller) is a
financial wizard, Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), is adopted and was a
published playwright at 11, and Richie (Luke Wilson) is a tennis
prodigy. We are provided the family history at the start of the film,
then are introduced to the family 22 years later. Chas is still a
financial wizard, but, having lost his wife in a plane accident is now
the paranoid father of two small sons. Margot is married to Raleigh St.
Clair (Bill Murray, who is basically Anderson's muse), is depressed and
hasn't written in years, and Richie, after having a nervous breakdown
on the tennis court a couple of years earlier is traveling the world by
boat. Still hanging around is Eli (Owen Wilson) a long-time family
friend from across the street who is now a literature professor and
successful novelist. Etheline is being wooed by her accountant, Henry
(Danny Glover) and when Royal gets wind of this, he embarks on a bid to
win his family back after not speaking with them for years.

Wes Anderson has an unusual style of film-making that has been static
throughout his career. Highly theatrical, almost in the style of a
play, he presents the story of the Tenenbaums to us as if it were taken
directly from a book, so much so that if you were to read the few
sentences that are visible in the book that accompanies the beginning
of each 'chapter', you would see that the written narrative follows the
action to the letter. Anderson favors primary colors, and characters
that are identifiable by very distinct appearances. Chas and his sons
have their red track suits they always wear, Margot wears the clip in
her hair, Izod dresses from the 80's and dark eyeliner surrounding her
eyes, Richie wears the sweatband around his head, Eli is in cowboy gear
and Raleigh looks like a Freud knockoff. One of the results is that
there are varying degrees of recognition for the actor in 'real life'.
When seeing Raleigh, it's easy to forget that it is Bill Murray, and
Margot for that matter is so different from how we are used to seeing
Paltrow. Certainly, this is Anderson's intent. Anderson also favors
point of view shots, characters looking directly at or addressing the
camera, and is also one of the few modern masters in the use of music.
The soundtrack to 'The Royal Tenenbaums' features some classic songs
(Ruby Tuesday, Hey Jude) but also has some obscure tracks that are
bizarre and fit into the scene beautifully.

'The Royal Tenenbaums' has a phenomenal cast, and all of the actors are
excellent in the film. I get the strong impression that, since Anderson
isn't a mainstream film director, A-list actors sign up to work for him
because of his alternative vision and his obvious talent. When I
watched this film recently, I asked the two friends I saw it with what
they thought, and they both said 'It was quirky'. Since they are both
film lovers, I was a little disappointed in this narrow (and obvious)
assessment of the film at first. Upon further reflection, however, I
realized that they both come from households that have parents who are
still together. Coming from a 'broken home' I can relate to the high
dysfunction of the Tenenbaums as an adult and embrace the story beyond
the presentation, despite its highly stylized format. 'The Royal
Tenenbaums' is a brilliant film that is both emotional and
eye-catching, and truly cements Wes Anderson as an exciting and
talented filmmaker. 9/10

Writing/Director team Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson follow up their wonderful
1999 film Rushmore with something not completely different but altogether
more satisfying and a good deal more powerful.

The Tenenbaums are a wealthy New York family of eccentric genuises, headed
by Angelica Huston. The pater familias Gene Hackman has been kicked out and
estranged from the family for twenty years. The film begins with a prologue
detailing the lives of the Tenenbaum clan - Ben Stiller, the real estate
genius and safety obsessive, now widowered with two boys. Luke Wilson a
former tennis wunderkind, now an isolated, lonely character all alone in the
world and Gwyneth Paltrow, the adopted daughter, playwright, depressive and
all-round misery guts. Other players include Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and
Danny Glover.

The excellent cast is testament to the fantastic script. Filled with
one-liners, hilarious situations and visual gags, it is a real winner.
However, it would be a mistake to take this for an out-and-out comedy.
Two-thirds in, the script takes a turn for the utterly dark with a bloody,
affecting scene, not to everyone's taste and at odds with the film gone
beforehand. It's a brave move by Wilson and Anderson and one that pays off
in dividends, elevating this movie above others in the genre.

Hackman gives as good as he's got as Royal Tenenbaum, who takes a turn for
the better when his kids wake him up to the kind of man he really is. His
transformation from manipulative and selfish to a genuinely lonely and
honest man is wholly believable. When he emerges as the only man who can
bring the whole family together again, it really brings a smile to your
face. The rest of the cast, with the exception of Luke Wilson, aren't given
a huge amount to do but do extremely well with what they've got. Luke Wilson
is superb, playing the confused and alienated Richie, at odds with himself
and the rest of his family. His is possibly the best character in the film,
symbolising all that is wrong with the Tenanbaum clan.> As usual, The Royal
Tenenbaums is rife with Anderson's distinctive directorial touches - 90
degree overhead shots, dialogue-free sequences played to classic rock
anthems, and memorably, towards the end, a one-take canvas shot, as
beautiful as it is inspired.

Special mention must also be given to the New York painted in the film. All
Georgian houses, tree-lined avenues and flat sky lines, it's one of the most
beautiful depections of this city ever seen in a movie.

 All in all, a delighful tragi-comedy, with great characters, lush direction
and great gags. Don't miss it!

I think if someone tries to watch a Wes Anderson film, they have to have a
certain kind mind to understand the real meaning of them. After being awed
by the Royal Tenenbaums, I left with a certain kind of joy that only a
great
film can give me. It's like flying an electric kite, it's that hard of a
buzz. As I began my travel down the stairs of the theater, I heard this
couple talking about how stupid the movie was, and how they are going to
ask
for a refund. I suddenly smiled, because I hoped that they would get one. I
think that I got something out of the film that they didn't. That inside
the
frames of the movie I felt like I was in good company and had a
understanding for the material that they didn't.  What is so good about the
Royal Tenenbaums?  The great detail in every frame, from the costumes (and
they really are costumes)to the design of Chas, Margot, and Richie rooms
and
the house. This is brilliant film on every level, a delight for the senses
and for the mind. This movie makes you think, and without giving too much
away there is a lot of surprises that come from the characters dialogue and
their past.  High kudos go to Luke Wilson, I loved his performance as the
suffering Richie.  If you loved Rushmore, there is no doubt that you will
love this film because it is at par with it, except that its a bit darker
in
tone.   I think its funny that way that people look at film, we each love
or
hate a film based on our own perception(and mind there are people who just
watch film for entertainment). So if you have a complicated mind and you
enjoy watching a challenging film, then the Royal Tenenbaums is for you. As
for me, I plan on watching it again so I find more things to love about it.
Thank you Wes Anderson, so much. You made laugh, you made me smile and I
cried. A thousand times, thank you!

The Royal Tenenbaums, to put it shortly, is a weird movie. It is the
story of a family longing for its heyday to return. It is the story of
a man who wants to be accepted. It is a story of redemption, filled
with small epiphanies and smaller details that make for excellent
viewing. It takes delight in showcasing its brilliant characterizations
and depictions of social oddities. Many will find it hard to relate to
such strangers and therefore decline to revel in this film's cinematic
glory. We can pity them.

Those that enjoy Wes Anderson's films can be put into two categories.
There are those that simply find them to be quirky joyrides and laugh
them off as such. Then there are those who recognize the loneliness in
all of the characters Wes Anderson writes - it is this sense of
loneliness that Wes Anderson, as a storyteller, brings to the screen.
It is this sense of loneliness that makes Wes Anderson one of the most
visionary filmmakers out there today.

The Royal Tenenbaums is an altogether thrilling experience. It is epic,
filled with pageantry. Though categorized as a comedy, at times it
seems darker then typical black comedies - a drama, or even a
triumphant tragedy of life's unrealized outcasts. As Margot Tenenbaum
(Gwenyth Paltrow) says in one of the last scenes: "Well, I'm sure he'll
get over it." The Royal Tenenbaums is a rejoicing in the human spirit's
reluctant but continuous march forward.
<|_=00=_|>

I first saw this film on TV and have never seen a director quite like
Wes Anderson displaying his outlook on life so expertly. He and Owen
Wilson have created a family beyond dysfunctional. Their underplayed
script of various oddballs all with their own tale of despair is as
left-field as you'll find, with each character, and I stress this, as
pathetic as the next.

Gene Hackman plays the lead role of Royal with huge confidence while
Paltrow (Margot), Stiller (Chaz), and Owen and Luke Wilson (Eli and
Richie), develop into fully fledged actors in their brilliant
well-rounded performances. Anjelica Huston plays the strong matriarchal
head of the family and gives the biggest whiff of normalcy from the
film with Kumar Pallana, the knife happy friend/butler/colleague at the
opposite end of the spectrum. Along with Pallana's inspired creation,
comes Anderson's strongest hand - background players. Like the Coens,
he truly adores every character and you feel background with each one.
Whether it be Danny Glover's sombre turn as Huston's love interest,
Royal's colleague and partner in deception or Buckley the dog. They
carry the film and keep it fresh.

The script is as above mentioned, slow-burning, letting its characters
develop with ease and no constraints. This sits perfectly with
Anderson's patient camera, and eye to present the story in a skit-type
basis which it very well may be with its spot-on throw away one-liners.
When pestered about the nature of his suicide note Richie replies
wryly, "Of course it's dark, It's a suicide note."

Its along with these, the acting and Andersons direction that
Tenenbaums is promoted from simply a cult or indie classic into
something so much more. The slow moments perfectly sober the funnier
and give room for rest and perspective. It is also where the film
delivers its most touching and poignant moments. The wedding scene is
totally destroying and will levels the viewer flat. As with Richie's
graphic suicide attempt and Royals ultimate demise in the company of
his previously absent son.

I cannot praise this film enough but I have tried.

<|_=00=_|>
I just finished watching this movie with commentary, and after seeing
how much care goes into each scene, I have fallen for the movie all
over again.

Even after watching this film 10+ times now, I love it all the more. I
have never held this movie as my favorite, but now it has moved into
the #1 position after a careful study, and realizing that even 50 more
viewings would not unlock all the little treasures hidden within.

You are doing yourself a huge disservice if you don't see this movie,
or if you dismiss it after a single viewing. Watch it, again if
necessary, and see what you are missing.
<|_=00=_|>

I've watched The Royal Tennenbaums 3 times so far and just ordered the
DVD. How can you beat the cast, the plot, and the humanity of this
film?

I dare you to find a better cast than Gene Hackman, Angelica Huston,
Danny Glover, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow, and the rest
of the crew.

The chemistry between them works magic on the screen.

Without giving away too much of the plot, it revolves around the family
of Royal Tennenbaum, a lovable rascal whose family hasn't forgiven him
for transgressions of the past. When his estranged wife decides she may
want to remarry, the games begin -- and oh what fun games they are. You
have to laugh.

Emotionally speaking, you will feel like you're riding a roller-coaster
with no dead space. If you are into quirky characters, intelligent
humor, and aren't afraid to stare painful aspects of human nature eye
to eye, you will love The Royal Tennenbaums.

<|_=00=_|>
This was a quirky film that surprised me, in that I liked it....at
least twice. By the third viewing, I had enough but I got my money's
worth out of it. That's what I would recommend with this movie: rent it
before considering buying it. It's very different, and you might love
but also might hate it.

What it is, simply, is a portrait of a very dysfunctional family and
the father trying to re-connect with his kids after a long absence.
Gene Hackman is the father, Angelica Huston the mother and the wacko
kids - and other assorted strange characters - are played by Ben
Stiller, Owen and Luke Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Bill
Murray and Danny Glover. 

This is mostly dry, dark humor with some funny lines delivered in
deadpan style. Nobody is particularly likable but - with the possible
exception of Paltrow's character - are not really unlikeable either.
They are just strange.

I enjoyed viewing the house with all its colors. For those who
appreciate low-key absurd humor nd some pleasing visuals, you should
like this film and I certainly recommend giving it a look.
<|_=00=_|>
The only spoiler is that this film is rubbish! I rented this on the
back of a friend's recommendation, but right now I just want to force
him to go through two hours of water torture so he can know just what
it feels like.

The only time I laughed during the entire length of the film was when
Gene Hackman's character fell into the pool. Hilarious, a 5 year old
could have dreamt that one up. It's really quite worrying that so many
people in Hollywood are paying hard money to finance this sort of
drivel.

Oh look, there's half a dozen alienated kids sitting around and fed up
with the world at large. There's also some OK cinematography and
scenery, but when the hell does that make a good film? Or at least one
that averages 7.6 on the IMDb scale? It is dull, monotonous, and so
slow that a Skoda would overtake it. This is clearly a film that
belongs to a certain clique of people who consider themselves to have
the 'inside joke' when it is readily apparent to most normal people
that there is, in fact, no joke.

Frankly on the whole I would have more fun detaching my testicles and
selling them on eBay.
