1985 was a top year for Chuck Norris,with Invasion USA and this immensely
enjoyable actioner coming out.Following on from the disappointing,slow
moving original,this charts his highly involving experiences in a Vietnamise
POW camp,and his eventual escape.A lot of depth is invested into the
characters,which fully envelops at the end when Norris faces off against
Soon Tech Oh.Given that the films were created by Chuck as a tribute to his
brother Wieland who was killed in Vietnam,it's not really so surprising in
hindsight to notice the extra invested energy and emotion he displays in
these films.And all the better for it.****

Although many people will disagree with me, I enjoy watching this movie.
While the acting may not be top-notch, the plot and setting give the
impression that you are actually a member of a POW camp and must struggle
along with Colonel Braddock (Chuck Norris) to escape. Following Braddock's
plight as a prisoner, the death of his comrades, and his final showdown
with
Colonel Yin (Soon Tek Oh), the movie nicely builds up to its climax and
leaves the viewer with a sense of finality that many movies tend to lack
in
their endings. This prequel is definitely the best in the MIA trilogy and
I
recommend it for viewing.

The picture focuses Colonel Braddock (Chuck Norris) aboard a helicopter
which is down . He is imprisoned , along with various Vietnam soldiers
(Steven Williams , John Wesley..), by a hideous and sadist POW camp
chief warden (Soon-Teck-Oh) and underlings (professor Tanaka..) . The
tough Braddock continuously attempts to free the prisoners held
captives and they receive numerous tortures and sufferings in charge of
the concentration camp wardens and their evil ruler .

The screenplay of the movie is plain and simple . It's a predictable
routine and formula actioner film . It's all obvious , unconvincing and
overblown . However if you appealed the first part , you'll probably
love this picture . It deals upon horrible conditions of prisoners and
grueling efforts of the meager band of captives to survive ,
confronting starvation , mistreats , rampage and continuous violence by
hitting , punches , lashes , knocks and incredible tortures . Storyline
is a bit ridiculous , embarrassing and shallow , it concerns on
prisoners trying to escape and subsequent revenge executed by Braddock
as a headstrong and reckless Colonel . In the wake of : ¨Uncommon
valor¨ (directed by Ted Kocheff) and ¨Rambo II¨ (by George Pan
Cosmatos) and Norris imitating to Silvester Stallone and Arnold
Schwarzenegger as one army man , shooting and killing numerous enemies 

The film results to be the second installment from a trilogy ,
concerning the first ¨Missing in action¨ (made by Joseph Zito) on
Braddock accused of war crimes by a Vietnam general and he then escapes
to free inmates ; this second part (directed by Lance Hool , the first
one 's producer) about tortures and Braddock suffering in a prisoner
camp , and the third part (directed by Aaron Norris , Chuck's brother ,
who in 'Missing in action 1' was the stunt coordinator) upon looking
for his wife after downfall Saigon . Filmed back to back with Missing
in action (1984) , this picture was supposed to be released first .
However , when ¨Cannon¨ realized the second film was the better of the
two , they released it first and re-titled this movie as a prequel .
The three films contain ominous and villain enemies played by oriental
actors (James Hong , Soon Teck Oh , Aki Aelong) with offensive racial
stereotypes . Nice support cast formed by Steven Williams (TV L.A.
Heat) and Professor Tanaka (a wrestler who possessed incredible
strength) who was arguably the successor to Harald Sakata (Golfinger)
as the archetypal Asian henchman . Appropriate musical score by Jay
Chattaway and adequate as well as atmospheric cinematography by
cameraman Joao Fernandez , filmed on location in Philippines . The
motion picture was middlingly directed by Lance Hool , also producer .
Rating : Average but entertaining . The motion picture will appeal to
Chuck Norris fans .

This movie has no use for a plot and it makes no apologies about it.
The closest the entire film comes to forming a plot is when the words
"Geneva Convention" are randomly thrown out by Chuck Norris in the
first couple minutes. Luckily Colonel Yin quickly shoots down the idea
that the real world has any bearing on the movie's setting and we're
off to the races- Jungle style.

***there may be spoilers**** 

The beginning of the movie shows all of the members of Norris' crew
being captured and declared Missing In Action (hence the title). From
that point on the movie is set ten years later where we find the men
still being held hostage and all but forgotten.

For some reason the prisoners just don't seem like they have been there
ten years though. In the opening prison camp scene one of the prisoners
is complaining how he can't sleep and explains that every time he
closes his eyes he sees his wife GINA! If he had been there ten years
wouldn't he have established at some point that his wife is named Gina?
Couldn't he just say "when I close my eyes I see my WIFE!"? Well either
way, the story is they've been there ten years so we'll go with that.
Why they have been held hostage in a remote Vietnamese torture camp for
ten years without being killed makes no sense although there is a faint
attempt to explain it for the sake of giving the men a reason to be
there, the colonel a reason to torture them, and the film a reason to
exist.

The reason Norris and his men are being held, you ask? Apparently the
Vietnamese colonel is a very prideful man (although he's not above
sentencing himself to live in a jungle prison camp for ten years in
order to monitor it and ensure that nobody escapes) and he requires
that Norris sign a document stating that the Americans have committed
war crimes against the Vietnamese and accept their guilt. The fact that
this is the entire reason these men have been held in the camp for TEN
YEARS is completely ridiculous. We are to believe that Norris is such a
dedicated soldier that he refuses to sign the document even though he
could simply sign it, go home, eat a pizza, get some reinforcements,
and go back to finish off the remaining Vietnamese and any record of
what he signed.

Because Norris refuses to sign the document the vengeful, yet oddly
patient, Colenel Yin keeps him there and occasionally tortures him now
and then for good measure. Apparently Colonel Yin has no problem
imprisoning, degrading, and killing human beings, but he draws the line
at forging someones signature.

The movie does provide some of the best jungle action pre Arnold
Schwarzenegger's Predator however. There are some good fight scenes
with many two and even three hit combos dealt out by Norris. Throughout
the movie the Colonel always has the upper hand and uses the line "you
lose" every time he foils Norris. With a one liner as great as that
there's little doubt that it will be used against him once Norris turns
the tables by the end of the movie. And in the jungle Norris doesn't
disappoint.

By far the best part of the movie is the end when Norris gets his mitts
on a cache of Columbian firearms/explosives and comes back to the camp
for sweet revenge.

And the most hilarious part of the movie is the fact that the only
escape from the jungle camp is by crossing a very long wooden bridge
over a huge ravine and this wooden bridge is guarded by a guy who's
only weapon is a flamethrower. Stop and think about that. Instead of a
machine gun, they give the guy guarding the WOODEN bridge a
flamethrower to defend himself. So does that mean every time someone
tries to escape he shoots at them with the flamethrower, the bridge
burns down, and he has to rebuild it the next day to go back to the
camp?

In the final scene Norris gets his revenge and beats down the colonel
like an arcade wizard using cheat codes at the Mortal Kombat machine.
Like I said before, the phrase "you lose" is conveniently dropped right
before the death blow is administered. What more can you ask for in a
movie that gave the entire premise away with the title?

When we last left Colonel James Braddock, he was shoving it up
Vietnamese butt by barging into their press conference about how they
didn't have any POWs in Vietnam with a POW he just rescued. Truly a
fairy tale ending, but what about the beginning of the fairy tale?
Missing in Action 2: The Beginning is his most personal mission of all!
Because it's when he was a POW himself! Which we already saw in
sporadic flashbacks in the first movie.

Missing in Action 2: The Beginning shows the capture of Colonel
Braddock (Chuck Norris) during the Vietnam war in the 1970s, his
captivity with other American POWs in a brutal prison camp, and his
plans to escape. Norris and his crew are holed up in a prison camp for
the whole picture, ruled by tyrannical Colonel Yin (Soon-Tek Oh) who
resorts to psychological mind games, torture and murder to try to make
Braddock sign a statement admitting to war atrocities he never
committed.

There seems to be no end to the different scenarios and interesting
scenes that play out during the film: escape attempts, arranged fights
between prisoners, a guy who stumbles onto the prison camp and gets
executed. Things really start to pick up when Braddock gets really mad
and you see him sneaking here and there, setting bombs, picking off
people one by one, freeing people, blowing up stuff, and staying behind
after everyone leaves because he doesn't believe Yin really died when
he bombed Yin's hut. 

But Chuck really delivers in the end, especially in his final feel good
showdown with Yin. In my opinion, Missing in Action 2: The Beginning is
the best of the Braddock movies, it's part action film and part action
drama, which sets it apart from the other movies.

The first time i ever watched this film was in the early 80's in the
cinema and it was great, and i still think it's great...

This feels like real movie. Not like cheap Rambo rip-off like first
one. To be honest this have some First Blood feeling in it but it is
not such rip-off as first one. Now we have real characters. Chuck
Norris feels like acting and story makes sense. You sense danger unlike
first one.

This happens before first movie and things happening in this movie are
mentioned in first one. You are not spoiled if you have seen first one.
Unless you count spoiling problem all prequels have. If I have
understood correctly this was shot before first one or at same time. It
makes little sense that this was released later than first one since
this happens before and is much better movie.

I prefer prison camp part at beginning over action part at the end.
This would have been better with less action but this is action movie
and Chuck Norris movie so action has to be there.
<|_=00=_|>

For many years I have enjoyed Chuck Norris. Now I can say that one of his
movies made me cry. This movie was an absolute heart-stopper, tear-jerker,
and gut-wrencher. This is a total psychological flick, exposing to the
viewers the horrors of Asian prison camps. Of course, Norris busts out in
the end with his comrades. After watching this movie one feels like a true
American. If you can't crack open a Budwieser and wear a t-shirt with an
American flag on the front you shouldn't watch this movie. This makes me
think of Bruce Springstein's Born in the U.S.A. The only thing missing from
this movie was Billy Drago, of course. All in all, a worthwile and moving
flick to view. Rent it right now, or better yet, buy it.

This is one that will probably be torn to shreds critically by snobby
europeans, and wannabe intellectual movie-goers who just cant get
enough of their bullet time, and 200 million dollar epics.This is
actually the prequel to the first Missing In Action movie.It tells the
story of a forgotten group of P.O.W.'s who are being brutalised by an
overbearing colonel who enjoys watching the vet's suffer.As the
prisoners numbers dwindle, one James Braddock decides to take charge of
the dire situation before its all too late.From the opening to the
fiery, action packed finale this film boasts raw combat and even dares
to throw in some emotion.I actually truly cared for the characters as I
wanted to see them survive and extract revenge upon their communist
enslavers.Truly strange times we live in when one cannot be proud to be
an American.I will always be proud and you can go back to your dull
German expressionist films.Chuck Norris is the man.I love 80's action!
<|_=00=_|>
Prequel to Missing in Action covers Braddock's years as a POW and his
eventual escape. This one was filmed back-to-back with the other movie
and was intended to be released first. But they realized the first
movie was better, so they moved it from part 2 to 1. Which is funny as
today there are many fans who claim part 2 is the better movie. I'm not
one of them but they're out there. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent
war movie and I like it. It's not action-heavy, though it never drags
and the action does pick up towards the end. It's more of a drama for
the first hour or so. Chuck is his usual stoic self. Soon-Tek Oh is a
suitably despicable villain. Steven Williams plays the POW who betrays
the others. Christopher Cary has a brief but enjoyable role as an
Australian photographer who tries to help the POWs. The continuity
doesn't line up with the previous movie (or the third), but I doubt
most viewers will care. If you like Chuck Norris' Cannon movies, you
will probably like this one.
<|_=00=_|>
It's not surprising to learn that Chuck Norris made this series as a
tribute to his brother who had been killed in Vietnam. He really gave
all that he had to these films. It may be manipulative but damn is it
ever satisfying. The villains are the kind of loathsome scum whom you
JUST CAN'T WAIT to see messed up in a variety of ways. And the good
guys are fleshed out enough as characters that you do feel bad for
them, and want to see them get their revenge.

As one can guess, this is a prequel to the original "Missing in Action"
film of 1984. It shows how Chucks' colonel character, James Braddock,
was shot down and captured during the war, and the tortures that he and
his men are obliged to endure for the next several years, even after
the war has basically ended. The sadistic colonel in charge of his work
camp, Colonel Yin (Soon-Tek Oh) acts like a dictator, and just when you
think you can't hate this guy any more, he ups the stakes yet again.

With Lance Hool taking the directors' reins, this proves to be a high
old time for the action junkie, underscored by the genuine poignancy to
be found in stories about prisoners of war. This is exciting much of
the time, with kick ass battle footage, lots of explosions, lots of
gunfire, and some breathtaking scenery. Chuck is a formidable hero as
always, and Oh is a deliciously evil bad guy. Lending strong support
are Cosie Costa, Joe Michael Terry, and especially John Wesley as the
ailing Franklin. Steven Williams is good in an initially unlikable part
as a captain eager to cooperate with his captors in exchange for better
treatment. It's also cool to see hulking screen heavy Professor Toru
Tanaka and "Ninja III: The Domination" villain David Chung as two of
the guards.

All in all, this is solid entertainment, complete with a high body
count and never ever boring.

Eight out of 10.
