Sylvester Stallone's "Staying Alive" is one of the most misunderstood movies
ever made. It is the sequel to the very popular "Saturday Night Fever".
However, "Staying Alive" is often pegged as a turkey in comparison to the
first film. That is very unfair.

I wonder whether critics have anything against the film or Stallone himself.
Stallone had established himself as a very capable director with "Paradise
Alley" in 1978 and "Rocky II" in 1979 and "Rocky III" in 1982. But they seem
unwilling to lay off Stallone and his many talents.
I think he does an excellent job continuing the story of Tony Manero (played
again by John Travolta).

If you love dance, you will love this film. Stallone uses his camera
extremely well to capture the nuances of dance itself. There is one very
strong sequence in which Tony and his on-again, off-again girlfriend
practice for a Broadway musical that takes up about 12 minutes and is just
exhilarating.

The story is also very good here. Tony is now a professional dance
instructor in Manhattan who has a chance to get a part in the hottest new
Broadway musical out there "Satan's Alley". Tony finds himself torn between
two women and Stallone asks a lot of tough questions about relationships
here that a harebrained movie wouldn't even touch.

Travolta is again on target here as Tony Manero. A lesser actor wouldn't
even touch material as tricky as this, but Travolta takes the risks and it
pays off. The music (by the Bee Gees and Frank Stallone) is excellent and
fulfills the same purpose music did in the original. 

"Staying Alive" probably won't ever receive the recognition it deserves. For
those of you wondering, I am not being paid by Paramount to say this. My
opinions CAN'T and NEVER WILL BE bought. I genuinely feel that this is an
exceptional film and that it deserves better than it has received over the
years.

**** out of 4 stars
<|_=00=_|>

I don't understand why critics always scorn this film. OK, it doesn't have
the magic of its predecessor "Saturday Night Fever", but it works as an
"80's point of view" of the original film. The thing is that you should
watch this film as a single one, not a 'sequel'. It has nothing to do with
"Saturday Night Fever" but the main character Tony Manero (once again played
by John Travolta) and his mother (Julie Bovasso) in a brief
appearance.
Fast forward from 1977 to 1983. Now Tony wants to be a Broadway star and
keeps his struggle for a more mature purpose, as he himself is more mature.
Manero's "moody girl" here is Laura (Finola Hughes, not so convincing), who
also looks down on him.
The funniest thing about "Staying Alive" is that it is directed by Sylvester
Stallone! (No one remembers...)
The soundtrack is one of my favorite, although it didn't received the
deserved attention at the time of its release, nor did the movie itself. (I
think people were afraid of another 'Bee Gees fever').
After this film, Travolta's career fell out of the spotlight only to be
retaken in late 80's with "Look Who's Talking".
Summarizing, in my opinion it is a very good movie, but don't expect this to
be another "Saturday Night Fever".

I absolutely agree with Treadway...this is one of my favorite movies
ever...when it came out in 1983 my kids were babies and we still had
drive ins..I must have taken my babies to see that(they slept)7 times
at the drive in..the music..the dancing...everyone was so good
looking..it was and is a FUN movie..and thats what counts..!! Now my
new kids can enjoy it as well...I LOVE Cynthia Rhoads..she can dance
her fanny off and she is a wonderful singer as well. No this movie
won't win an Oscar but how many times do you want to see Sheindlers
List(sp)? The music is wonderful..I ADORE the Bee Gees and the dance
number with Travolta and Rhodes is so sensual and sexy. The last number
is just plain FUN...I don't have anything bad at all to say about this
movie..10+ stars..!!

Watching "Staying Alive" will do that to you.  A truly perplexing movie it
raises all sorts of questions like "Why was this thing made?" and "Why
would
Travolta do this?"  I guess those were pretty lean years for Barbarino, so
we should cut him some slack.  Now Sylvester Stallone, he should have known
better.

"Staying Alive" is the sequel to the hit, and FAR superior movie, "Saturday
Night Fever."  This film is hardly a sequel people were crying out to see,
and it doesn't surprise me in the least that it's a very obscure
movie.

Travolta reprises his "Fever" role, as Tony Manero, the big-haired,
tight-clothes, bad-accented dancer from Brooklyn.  On his own and trying to
make it as a dancer, he works his hardest to become a big star.  Does he
make it?  Well you have to watch, and let me tell you it's a riveting
ride.

Or not.  "Alive" is a terribly funny movie, for all the wrong reasons.  The
play Tony ends up in is a particular highlight.  Called "Satan's Alley,"
it's a man's descent into hell, full of laser lights, mist, and scantily
clad women.  This is the first Broadway movie I had heard of that was
totally dancing, no singing, speaking, or character development.  Kudos to
the fact checker for the film, who had obviously seen a lot of Broadway
shows.  Even "Cats" was more coherent than that piece of
crap.

But the real highlight is Travolta himself.  As directed by Stallone, he
bears more than a passing resemblance to Rambo in almost every scene of
consequence.  Every single time the guy dances in the movie one of two
things happen.  Either A)  he gets really sweaty and greasy, or B) you get
tons of shot of his disgusting package.  Those dance pants are WAY too
tight.

"Staying Alive" is a bizarre movie.  You get the feeling Stallone and the
rest of the crew thought they were making an incredible movie.  It shows in
every self-obsessed frame of this film; it takes itself way too seriously
and ends up looking absolutely ridiculous.  Recommended for fans of
ridiculously poor movies.

For those of you who think this movie is a let down, then I am afraid
you are let down.

This 80's classic has more fever in its final scene than the whole of
the first movie put together.

Okay the first one rocked, get over it, its a story about life and
having the confidence to go for it. There is not a part in this movie
that is I personally don't like, in fact I could probably read the
script start to finish. I ain't no freak but this movie is quite simply
a master piece, It is the Rocky IV of dance movies and twice the film
at that. Its a progression of his life, the disco days are gone and he
needs to get something going to quench his thirst for life. It if
anything teaches you to reach for the the unattainable, the only
barriers in life are the ones we put up our selves, Manero teaches us
we can go all the way and not sell ourselves short. Read between the
lines 80's Edam and I love it!

I GIVE YOU THE LEAD IN A Broadway SHOW AND YOU WALK OUT THE DOOR!

Count it Down! and 5678.

I'm not going to say this is the best movie ever made, but I won't deny
I've seen it dozens of times, and that it's one of my all-time
favorites. Part of the reason that it's become one of those movies
people love to hate is that, of course, it's a sequel to a genuinely
really good film, a serious movie that's not really about dancing at
all, Saturday Night Fever. If you can set aside the comparison and the
anger that Stallone may have "ruined" the attempt at a good sequel
(please--as if SNF even had a possibility for a serious sequel!), then
you can enjoy this movie on its own level, as a fun piece of
sexploitation with a dance twist not at all different from that other
big 80's dance movie, Flashdance.

As such, it's fantastic. Tony Manero has made it across the bridge and
now he has his sights set on a starring Broadway role. It's hard, of
course, and although he's a fine dancer, he must struggle through two
jobs (dance instructor and hot waiter) while trying to break into
showbiz. He shares the struggle with the single most underrated 80's
icon, Cynthia Rhodes (also in Flashdance and Dirty Dancing). He likes
her well enough but likes Finola Hughes (Blossom, How Do I Look?) much
better, echoing the struggle between okay and just great loves he had
in SNF. His one-night-stand with Laura (Hughes) gets him a part in a
musical called Satan's Alley (a Dante-meets-Fosse extravaganza). When
the surreptitiously gay male lead turns out to be "too mechanical" to
get the sparks going with sultry Laura, Tony replaces him successfully
(he has "anger" and "intensity"). Tension is created by the most
ordinary love triangle, and just before the final act on opening night
Laura tries to deflate an exuberant Tony after he rejects her
invitation to get together after the show by telling him he doesn't
"have it." To prove he does, Tony spins her into a smoke cloud and
performs an impromptu solo that proves to all that he indeed has "it"
and then some. The movie ends with the simplest of all conclusions:
yep, Tony made it!

Sounds awful? It is! On the one hand, you can almost see the idea
behind this plot, some genuine (if horribly executed) effort at
continuing SNF's storyline: was Tony serious about leaving all the
Brooklyn b-llsh-t behind him after he realizes the emptiness of his
life that horrible night? Could he really learn to respect women, even
to be a friend to one? Did he have what it takes to make it outside his
small pond? On the other, apparently no one was able to provide
satisfying answers to these questions. The love triangle doesn't move
beyond the original; it mocks it. The Tony Manero character doesn't
seem to grow at all. If anything, it's even less introspective.

But trying to evaluate a plot in a movie like this is like trying to
find profundity in an episode of Charlie's Angels. What makes this
movie good is exactly what makes it bad, too. Travolta was never in
better shape in his life, and he dances well. This can be either gross
or riveting. I don't know if Hughes did her own dancing (seems so), but
she's supple and sexy, if not as absolutely liquid as Rhodes, who is
mesmerizing. Some dance sequences are great; some just awful (the
strobe sequence is laugh-out-loud ridiculous). Some music is great
("Someone Belonging to Someone" by the Bee Gees); some pap ("Never
Gonna Give You Up"). The fact that the plot and the dialogue are skimpy
is actually a blessing. Do you really want to hear these people
talking? No. The music does the talking, when it's good.

Here's what I propose: I propose that, if this had been a stand-alone
film, if the plot were just background and SNF had never been made,
this movie would be as beloved as Flashdance or Footloose or Dirty
Dancing or any of those. Some people don't like these either, but
that's okay because nobody likes them.

What, no user comments for Staying Alive?  Well then I guess I better add
one.  :)  This movie is entertaining, but I must tell you, I always thought
this film was considered a BIG flop until I checked business information
here.  Hell, it made almost 70 million - that doesn't sound like too much of
a flop to me.

Staying Alive is a pretty good film, though not even close to the MONSTER
that Saturday Night Fever was years earlier.  It has a nice soundtrack
(again, how can it compare to the one from the first film - TWENTY MILLION
albums sold is no easy feat to match) and manages to make us still love Tony
Manero no matter how big of a dork he is at times.

Yeah, the film is unbelievable and silly as hell at times, but it's still a
good hour and half of fun to check out when you have time.  How many people
remember this film was directed by Sylvester Stallone?  Not many.  Look for
his cameo performance (he bumps into Travolta on the street while passing
by) as well as hearing someone yell "Yo Adrian! Showtime" while the dancers
are preparing for their show toward the end of the film.  Corny stuff, but
fun, and Tony can still strut.  Enjoy!
<|_=00=_|>
I think this movie is really underrated. Even though it is a little
predictable and the acting is not the greatest, i LOVE it and i think
that it is worth watching. Me and my sister must've watched it over
fifty times. The music is great and the dancing is entertaining. John
Travolta is always cool and every character is unique and likable, even
Butler(wink) and Laura, the witch. It is humorous at many parts and, (i
know i'll get attacked by this comment), but i liked it way better than
the first movie. But i liked Grease 2 also. Please watch Staying Alive,
it's really good. And if you like dancing movies, watch the In-crowd
(1988), it's cool.

If Saturday Night was the fever, then Staying Alive is Sunday morning when
the cold's broken and all you're left with are some sticky
bedsheets.

Don't get me wrong, I do like Sylvester Stallone, but his finger has never
been firmly on the button marked "quality control" and in directing this
sequel he's produced one of his more notable failures. If Sly sees himself
as God, then he moulds Travolta in his own image, a virtual look-alike with
waxed chest, pumped-up physique and Rambo-style headband. This narcissistic
study of excess seems determined to float around indulgent dance numbers and
close-ups of John's crotch in too-tight tights.

The idea of updating the Tony Manero character for the aerobics generation
isn't bad, but completely misguided here. The first Manero film was
relatively gritty and harsh. Here the plot hinges entirely around the
flaccid dance sequences, the character-based scenes serving only as filler
between 80s pop. At one point Manero reveals that he has a "new mature
outlook on life... I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't curse." You know,
all of the things that made him interesting in the first
place?

The formerly hard-hearted Manero here meets his match with the dire Finola
Hughes, playing an ice queen as shallow and insensitive as he is. Cue
predictable role reversal theme as she dumps him after a one-night stand. I
actually thought Hughes was sporting a fake English accent, but it turns out
she really is a native  it's just that her acting is so chronic. She's one
of the main reasons the film doesn't work, as her misguided performance
never really gels.

A montage is used to illustrate the developing relationship between Travolta
and Hughes, which highlights co-writer Stallone's lack of skill with
dialogue sequences. Much of the movie relies on music to artificially create
its mood, including such subtleties as Frank Stallone's "Moody Girl". All
the new songs, including the material by the Bee Gees, are strictly elevator
muzak offerings; a shortcoming further highlighted by the use of the
original's "Staying Alive" as the end credits theme.

Real problem with the picture is that many of the scenes are short and
sketchy, creating a disjointed feel that prevents the viewer from becoming
fully immersed in the narrative. The anaemic plot and lack of onscreen
chemistry lends the film no dramatic impetus, and it just slides aimlessly
from scene to scene. Now living in Manhattan, as at the end of the previous
movie, Manero has no great motivation for bettering his life the same way he
did in the first. There's no Bronx or oppression to escape, nowhere to run
to. Manero's dream in this one is merely to star in a Broadway production of
"Satan's Alley". Satan's Back Passage would be more appropriate. If this is
Staying Alive then it's on a respirator machine  somebody pull the
plug.

Some of the lines aren't all that bad. After hearing second-best girlfriend
Jackie (Cynthia Rhodes) saying goodnight to a male friend, Manero bemoans
"It was so sweet, it was like syrup... I had a cavity just listening to it."
The majority though falls between functional and cod psychology. "If you had
a brain in that thick skull of yours, you'd stop worrying about trying to
change other people, and start worrying about changing yourself!" Manero is
told at one stage. Ultimately, the film scuppered my childish habit of using
title quotes, as there really was nothing worth repeating.

Sequels are usually by definition lacking. Audiences want to see more of the
characters they loved in the first place, yet they can rarely advance in
case they become unrecognisable. Very few follow-ups expand or add to their
source material, and, while different, Staying Alive brings nothing new to
the party. Not truly terrible, but very forgettable, and completely
inessential. 4/10.
<|_=00=_|>
The problem with Staying Alive is that the foundation of it is from an
era that had passed. Sure, in the early-mid 1980s, there were plenty of
films about dancing: Footloose, Flashdash, Breakin', etc., etc., but
Tony Manero (his attitude and dancing prowess) is a product of the
mid-late 1970s disco scene…which, stylistically, by 1983 was dead.
Trying to interject him into an era where dancing films were now
steeped in spandex, leg warmers, ostentatious synthesizers, turn table
scratching, glitzy pyrotechnics, and flamboyant "CATS"-esque outfits
just seemed…well…awkward.

While John Travolta puts on a great performance and is endlessly
mesmerizing throughout the whole film, the Tony Manero character,
overall, comes across very "different" than before. Though he continues
to be cocky and full of himself, this time around very conspicuous
dimensions of merriment, tenderness, vulnerability and patience are so
interpolated into his character that it almost seemed—in a way—like not
the same guy. Can someone really mellow THAT much in only six years? He
comes across more like a nicer, slightly older, cousin of the original
Manero. And while it's likable, sure, it's still a bit distracting and
weird. Laura, the "heroine" of the film (if you can call her that),
meanwhile is thoroughly obnoxious in just about every scene she's
in…which is disappointing because at the beginning of the movie you
expect to like her.

The ending of the film, with Tony (after having given a triumphant
performance during his Broadway revue) strutting up the street to the
sounds of the Bee-Gee's "Staying Alive" is a delightful throwback to
the original film, but at the same time it also immediately hearkens
your mind back to SNF and brings to a head why this sequel isn't as
good. If you take the film for what it is, and are able to disconnect
from what you know about Saturday Night Fever, then it's worth
watching…once. But if you go into watching it with SNF in your head
(like most of us automatically will), then you are going to be left
feeling at somewhat of a loss on how to take it.
