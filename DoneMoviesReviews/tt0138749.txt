Of course, i was missing it too, until about fifteen minutes
in.

Okay -- the title is "THE ROAD TO El Dorado"  Hands up, everyone with whom
that rings a bell.

No?

Okay -- its stars are two fast-talking con men who get out of trouble by
faking fights with each other,and who *almost* play pattycake at a
point.

Still no bells ringing?

How about if i point out that, at one point, our heroes' images are briefly
morphed into the faces of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby for about two
frames?

Right.

This is a tribute to/animated version of those hilarious (if you're in the
right frame of mind) "B" comedies starring Bob Hope and Bing Crosby (and
Dorothy Lamour in a sarong -- does Chel look any more familiar, now?), all
of which were entitled "The Road to..." somewhere or other.

Nothing in them was meant to be taken seriously, and very little in this
film is.

I have to agree with a number of reviewers who say, with varying degrees of
indignation, that this is not a kids' film.

Duh.

It wasn't meant to be. It was meant to ba a general-audience, PG-rated
film.

WILL you people PLEASE get it through your heads that "animated" does not,
necessarily, equal "kids' movie"?

Animation is just another film-making technique, to be used to make any kind
of film the animator wants to make, and if you think that animation is
automatically for kids, check out... oh, say... "Akira" or "Fantastic
Planet" or "Heavy Metal".

"Road to El Dorado" is an excellent all-ages film, (with the caveat that is
IS a PG-rated one, and that you ought to think about what you want your kids
to watch) and anyone who sees anything bad or prurient in the scenes that
everyone has been complaining about should take a close look at
themselves...

One of the few more-modern animated films I still enjoy; maybe that's
because it doesn't happen to revolve around "The power of
friendship/love/whatever" and isn't some sappy love story, like many of
Disney's drek has been (though it does have a minor, slightly sleazey
love-ish story in the background). Dreamworks is a breath of fresh air
in times like these, it would seem.

The plot works on many levels; it's straightforward enough for the
general kid to understand and enjoy, but is piled under levels of wit
and more jokes that rely on understanding more of it, making it
balanced and still funny the 150+th time I watch it.

The songs are catchy (as can be well-expected from the good man Elton
John), the characters are lovable yet total sleazeball con-men, and the
humour is on many levels; and with it, it brings many good, memorable
lines ("'For three days?!' 'YES! Don't even breathe!'" and "'You're
buying your own con!' 'At least I'm not DATING mine!' '... oooh, low
blow.'" come to mind).

As a basic rundown, there's Miguel, the fun-loving, more light-hearted
of the two con-men; he tends to appreciate the beauty in fun and
people. Tulio, the other half of the duo, has a bit more preoccupation
with material possessions and wealth, though he still remains human.
Then there's Chel; the seducer from the city of gold, able to help the
two (at a price). And our main antagonist? Tzekel Khan (spelling
unsure), a rather nutsy high priest and speaker for the gods, who
proves to be... well, a basket case.

The animation pulls itself off well; the movie is bright and colourful,
but not a kiddie flick at all- rather, it's humorous on all scales- my
friend's 6-year-old-brother, I, and my 55-year-old dad agree. The Road
to El Dorado is enjoyable on all accounts. If nothing else, consider
renting it.

Every new animated film seems to break new ground in technique and
execution.  Technology and computers have brought animation to new heights
of excellence.

"The Road to El Dorado" is no exception.

There is a scene in which Cortez' ship is bearing down on the  boat that
Tulio (voice of Kevin Kline) and Miguel (voice of Kenneth Branagh) are
escaping in -- Miguel looks up and, just before their boat is capsized,
yells "HOLY SHIP!"

Some parents grabbed their children and stormed out of the theater because
of what they THOUGHT they heard.  If you are going to watch a movie --
PLEASE pay attention and do not jump to erroneous conclusions.

The soundtrack with music by (Sir) Elton John and lyrics by Tim Rice has
Oscar nomination written all over it.

Rosie Perez as 'Chel' is magnificent -- giving just the right amount of
innuendo (so the parents will get it) without it being blatantly obvious. 
She is great -- but then I have always liked her.

There is a hint of "Shangri-La" about this film...  

All too rare for an animated film "The Road to El Dorado" has a cohesive
story and a real plot.

While it does drag a bit at times the music helps to move the story along
and is always a pleasant diversion.

Some of the story was fairly predictable.  However, I was wondering right up
to the conclusion just how this fable would end.

I was pleasantly surprised.

It was all wrapped up in a neat package complete with a
bow.

Of course it left a sequel wide open.

You probably think the one line summary of this comment is a bit strange,
since The Road to El Dorado isn't in fact that old, but what I meant by it
is that they do not make feature films like this anymore. Sure every now and
then there is a great animated film that revives the Adventure genre of
film-making, but that's basically it. If you're an adventure freak like I am
and you simply love Indiana Jones or Stargate or The Mummy for all I care
you should definitely watch this film. I bet you'll enjoy it, disregarding
your age (although very small kid's might get frightened at times). Thank
you Dreamworks for providing me with a fantastic story of adventure. I
appreciate it. It's been so long since I've seen any good adventure (The
Mummy was last and Indy before that).

TO ALL STUDIOS I MUST SAY THIS: start making feature films like this again
please, I miss them. Does it seem Â‘right' to you that I I have watch an
animated film mostly aimed at children, to get a film with a good plot, a
good villain, great action, enough thrills, blood and emotion? It does not
sound right to me. No Bad Boys II, no Triple X 2, no stupid and expensive
action. You can do big with little as long as elements fit
together.

What can I say?  The Road to El Dorado kept me hooked right from the very
start, proving to be an amazing adventure filled with action, comedy,
color,
breath-taking imagery and music.
After The Prince of Egypt, I wasn't too keen on another Dreamworks animated
film.  Don't ask me why, but Prince of Egypt just failed to reel me in.  El
Dorado on the other hand has restored my faith in the studio.

I'll keep this short and to the point.  El Dorado seemed to deliver the
goods in every aspect.  The music was great and certainly enhanced the mood
and scene, Tim Rice and Elton John did a fantastic job with the
instrumental
score.
The characterisation was done quite well, and you could really sense the
strong friendship that Tulio and Miguel had with one another.  Chel was
also
a character favorite of mine, and Rosie Perez did a great job providing her
voice!
The artwork was also exceptionally good, with the colorful Mayan themes and
designs providing an amazing backdrop for the story.  Of course the film is
not without its fair share of eye-candy, the special effects were excellent
and Dreamworks didn't go overboard with them.
The story was also a nice change.  For once it wasn't the tired, rigid old
formula of "good guys meet bad guys, conflict, defeat bad guys and
everyone's happy".  I mean..sure everyone is happy in the end...and there
is
the token good guy VS bad guy routine but Dreamworks seemed to mince it up
somewhat and introduce all-new elements.

Surely it has its flaws, you say.  Well in all honesty, I'm hard pressed
coming up with any.  I didn't exactly love the character design for Tulio
and Miguel but that's just being incredibly petty....

All in all, The Road to El Dorado was very refreshing and a welcome change
from the usual Disney-formula-based feature.  As for comparisons and
similarities with the "brilliance of Disney", I believe that there is no
need for that talk.  I ask you, why do we need more Disney?  The Road to El
Dorado shines in a light all of its own.

This has got to be one of the most hilarious animated movies of all time.
The situational comedy is truly amazing.

The voice acting is well done as well however the song are a little
disappointing, coming from the duo that brought us the soundtrack of The
Lion King. Only a couple are good.

However the comedy and the great visuals definitely make up for
it.

This movie is definitely a must see!!!

Rating: 10/10

First things first, I am 56 years old and I have to say that I adored
this movie. It didn't seem childish or silly at all, on the contrary it
had language and dialogue that my 6 year old grandson wouldn't
understand! The plot was exciting, the characters deep. Towards the end
when I thought that Tulio and Chel were leaving Miguel for good, tears
sprang into my watery blue eyes. I almost couldn't stand it! The part
in which the chief played ball with the village children was so
adorable! The movie wouldn't be complete without it.

I also loved the song, "It's Tough to be a God" because I couldn't keep
from tapping my foot! It was so exciting!!!! All in all, The Road to El
Dorado is an awesome animated film and a masterpiece!

As a new non-Disney animated film debuts I always find myself asking will
we ever have one that can match Disney's musical timing and humorous tone.
"The Road to El Dorado" is one of those that comes really close to being
as
brilliant as Disney.
The films title talks about a path that leads to the mysterious Mayan
"City
of Gold". This myth has been passed down for hundreds of years. In the
1500's a lot of Spanish conquistadors went to the New World in search of
this city after it seemed to be impossible to find the "Fountain of
Youth",
the other mythical discovery. This legend was screaming to be a fantasy
film.
In the Dreamworks interpretation of this legend, we follow the
misadventures of two con-artists (voiced by Kenneth Branagh and Kevin
Kline)
who accidentally win a treasure map in a craps game. When the game goes
sour, the cons hide out in some barrels and end up on a boat bound for the
New World. To their bad luck the boat happens to be captained by the most
famous of the Spanish conquistadors, Cortez. Thrown in the depths of the
ship by Cortez, our two heroes plan their escape. Without spoiling anymore
of the film, the two end up in the New World to follow their
map.
The Dreamworks animators deliver lush rich scenery and delightful
characters. These characters and scenery were a lot like the brilliance
found in Disney's "Jungle Book" and last year's amazing "Tarzan". If you
remember back to "Prince of Egypt" we had that magnificent look and the
celebrity voices but no real memorable relationships. The intricate
relationships between the characters in this film is one more step ahead
forward Dreamworks.
But what the film lacked was a real memorable song. The team of Elton John
and Tim Rice, who dreamed up the brilliant soundtrack of the "Lion King",
really never deliver a solid song that your kids will be singing weeks
after
the film. The songs here really have no heart but instead just play during
some of the weaker scenes of the film. Now all they have to do is deliver
musical songs and a musical score we will want to listen to after the film
closes.
Disney still reins supreme as head animation studio. But watch out Mickey,
Dreamworks is one step behind. (4 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.

Let me start by saying that I liked 'The Road to El Dorado'. It has some
nice songs, good animations and it was very funny. I especially liked the
horse Altivo. The thing that bothered me is that most of the things on
screen I had already seen in other movies. Well, one in particular. Two guys
come to a strange place. They are mistaken for Gods because a miracle
happens by accident. They have a plan to steal the gold in that place, but
one of them wants to stay. This is 'The Road to El Dorado' but also 'The Man
Who Would Be King' from 1975 starring Sean Connery and Michael Caine. Here
we Tulio and Miguel voiced by Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh. They have the
same funny chemistry as Connery and Caine had. In 'The Road to El Dorado' we
have also a love interest, Chel (voice by Rosie Perez), and a high priest
named Tzekel-Kan (voice by Armand Assante) who doubts the divinity of the
two men. I liked it, but not because it was very original. If you haven't
seen 'The Man Who Would Be King' you are able to enjoy this movie also for
the story. Anyway, you will not be bored.
<|_=00=_|>
There is nothing much that is bad that is to be said about this film.
The characters, Tulio and Miguel, were fun, entertaining, and the plot
itself was much the same way. I was surprised, however (though not
necessarily disappointed), at how Disney-like this movie was, coming
from Dream Works. Dream Works tends to go for a more "crude" or
"sarcastic" humor. They don't seem to like using two scrawny, goofy men
as main characters or having an antagonist that is so evil that you can
hardly express how evilly evil he is. Both of these were present in the
movie, as well as a scene where Tulio and Miguel *gasp* dance and sing!
Verrrrry Disney-like if you ask me.

Either way, I found the movie to be excellent. It is nothing that makes
your jaw drop in absolute awe, but it makes your side hurt aplenty. The
music was very fitting, and sounded beautiful. The animation stunned
me, even though the movie had been more than 5 years old when I saw it
the first time (perhaps showing Dream Works animation superiority over
Disney?) I would definitely recommend it for if you are looking for a
good laugh.
