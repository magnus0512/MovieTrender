I never have been a fan of the "Halloween" series. Not to say that I
don't like slasher films, but Michael Myers just never did anything for
me. I would rather watch a "Friday the 13th" film any day over this
series. "Halloween 3: Season of the Witch" is the only movie from the
series that I just didn't enjoy, but is actually one of my all time
favorite horror films. Partially, because Michael Myers isn't in this
film. Now, I am sure that people are going to hate my opinion on this,
but I really don't care. I believe the only reason why this movie is so
underrated and has such a low score on IMDb is because it doesn't have
Michael Myers in it. If this movie had dropped the "Halloween" title
and stuck with "Season of the Witch" or "The Last Halloween" I think
this movie would have much more respect.

This movie has many things on its side. The storyline is one of the
darkest I have ever seen about a company named "Silver Shamrock"
selling Halloween masks. All through the movie television adds build up
to a big "Give Away" on TV on Halloween night. Tom Atkins plays a
doctor named Dan who suspects the "Silver Shamrock" company after a man
is murdered in his hospital. The mans daughter and Dan take a trip to
the town where the factory resides and find out much more then they
could have bargained for.

As I said, this movie has many things going for it. A few great actors
including Tom Atkins and Dan O'Herlihy do wonderful jobs. Especially
O'herlihy, playing the part of the villain and one of the most evil
characters ever created.

The music was great also. Performed by John Carpenter, of course. The
music brings a great deal of atmosphere to the movie making you feel a
sense of dread through and throughout. But, this is a great part of any
of the "Halloween" movies. Like them or not, most of them have a good
soundtrack.

And of course, the ending to the movie is one of the best/worst endings
ever, in my opinion. Hollywood wouldn't dare have a movie end as bleak
as this movie did today.

Well, you don't have to listen to me. But, I thought this was a great
movie and I wish that it was never named "Halloween III". A bad
decision, an excellent horror movie. 9/10

I think Tommy Lee Wallace's "Season of the Witch" is an underrated
classic. There are no points here for outstanding acting performances,
or original plot etc (although I would like to add there's no dreadful
acting) but bonus points for the music and direction, which go together
to make a really creepy horror. It contains superb imaginative gore
sequences, to rival the likes of "The Fly" or "Dead & Buried".

Whereas the Michael Myers type slasher movies have done the genre to
death, this one remains dusty and untouched. There aren't any other
horror movies worth mentioning, like this. It is very sci-fi horror
though, so I think if you've a problem with far-fetched content, you'd
best avoid the film as you will find it ridiculous.

I called it Season of the Witch in the first sentence, because I prefer
to think of it as it's own movie, rather than having anything to do
with the original classic "Halloween". This is the only problem with
the movie.

"Oh ... and Happy Halloween".

Let's get some things straight...

The only real reason people seem to hate this film is because Michael
Myers was absent.

For those who don't know, John Carpenter and crew decided since Michael
Myers was dead at the end of HalloweeN II, there was no reason to
continue on with his story. The decision was to go ahead with the
series making each new installment a different story revolving around
the Halloween season. Personally, I think this was a wise decision. But
after everyone saw it they were screaming 'That wasn't a Halloween
movie! Where was Michael?'. Obviously the majority of the audience
would rather more Michael Myers rampages than creepy stories set around
Halloween time.

Oh well, this movie gives a taste of where the series could have and
should have went, before the disappointing HalloweeN 4.

Overall, the acting is top notch. Tom Atkins is a great actor. The
soundtrack is one of my favorite John Carpenter scores ever. It has
themes, but it's more about synthesized mood and pulsating rhythms. The
cinematography by the great Dean Cundey is fabulous. And the entire
feel of the film is very unsettling. The film literally freaks me out.

I recommend all of you that diss the film, to check it out once more.
Keep an open mind. If this hadn't been a part of the HalloweeN series
you would probably like it.

As for myself, I'm glad that this carries the HalloweeN title. Th rest
of the films didn't pick up until HalloweeN H2O which is a very worthy
entry.

I like "Halloween III". Some people consider it to be one of those "so
bad it's good" kind of films, but they're wrong. It's competently made
and much better than the "Halloween" films that appeared after it. As
sequels go it's pretty strange, though. For starters, Michael Myers is
nowhere in sight. This second sequel has nothing to do with the two
previous films in the series (personally I couldn't care less about
that) and the plot is downright weird. What's strange about it is that
there's very little symbolism at stake - something which is rare in
occult horror films. Normally, filmmakers seem to feel that they need
some sort of psychological excuse to show us unrealistic horror. Not so
in "Halloween III". We never get to know the main characters and get
only the most superficial impression of their personalities. The
sinister goings-on in the film have nothing to do with the personal
traumas of the protagonist - he's just there because he has to be, in
order for the plot to move on. In this sense, the film is refreshingly
"naive". The atmosphere or tone of the film is why I like it. It has
that "midnight movie" feel, mainly - I think - because of the
soundtrack. Music is rarely used, but always effectively like in John
Carpenters "The Thing" (1982). And there are some almost surreal images
thrown in along the way, like the one where snakes surprisingly appear
from within the pumpkinhead.
<|_=00=_|>
This is probably the most controversial Halloween movie, simply because
Michael Myers isn't in it. I know that this movie gets a lot of
complaints, but actually I can see where the writers were going with
this. They just had an idea to continue the Halloween stories, but just
to do a different type of franchise, which I give them a lot of credit
for. Does this movie deliver the same scares as the original Halloween
or even the sequel? No, it doesn't, but it's still creepy and not given
a proper chance by most. Just the song that is used alone in this movie
was a bit intense. It's a great little ghost story that is sure to
deliver chills if you have an open mind to it. The acting isn't as good
as the other movies, we have some pretty below par actors, but over all
they make the movie worth watching even if it was cheesy.

On Saturday, October 23, shop owner Harry Grimbridge is chased by
mysterious figures wearing business suits. He collapses at a gas
station clutching a Silver Shamrock jack-o'-lantern mask and is driven
to the hospital by the filling station attendant all the while ranting,
"They're gonna kill us. All of us." While Grimbridge is hospitalized,
another man in a suit enters his room and pulls his skull apart. The
man then returns to his vehicle, douses himself with gasoline and
lights himself on fire, causing the car to explode. Challis, together
with Grimbridge's daughter, Ellie, begins an investigation that leads
them to the home of the Silver Shamrock Novelties factory. They learn
from a hotel manager, Mr. Rafferty, that the source of the town's
prosperity is Irishman Conal Cochran and his factory and that the
majority of the town's population is made up of descendants of Irish
immigrants. Challis learns that Ellie's father had stayed at the same
hotel. Other guests of the hotel included shop owners Marge Guttman,
Buddy, Betty and their son "Little" Buddy. All have business at the
factory and eventually meet gruesome ends because of the Silver
Shamrock masks.The Kupfer family views the Silver Shamrock commercial
that will air on Halloween night. But there's more to these masks then
meets the eye. 

Is Halloween 3 the best sequel? No; is it the worst sequel? No; I'd say
just a lot of people got the wrong idea about the movie and didn't know
what the writers were thinking when the wrote for this franchise. I
loved the ending scene, it actually did give me a nightmare, I don't
want to give it away though, just trust me, it's a creepy scene. I do
recommend if you love horror movies to give this movie a fair chance or
if you want to see the Halloween movie franchise, just remember that
the writers just wanted to try something new. I do honestly like this
movie, I hope people will see it for what it is and it's just a good
ghost story to watch on a night for Halloween.

6/10

This movie is an all time classic. Creepy from the word go, the
lighting and soundtrack give it a theatrically dark and menacing feel,
while the characters are so ordinary that one feels one is watching a
drama-doc. Then the extreme violence with crushed heads and people set
ablaze. There is a tangible sense of mystery to all this. Our hero is a
slightly flawed character, womaniser and boozer, but an honest sort of
guy. The idea of filming at a mask factory is inspired - all those
creepy faces! The factory owner Cochran is one of the finest horror
characters ever to grace the screen. Profoundly eerie yet likable,
humorous yet intimidating, he has the quality of an educated, cultured
serial killer with the monstrous ambition of a megalomaniac from a Bond
movie. His evil plans are particularly horrific in scale, but he sees
them as one big joke on the kids!
<|_=00=_|>
Let me begin by saying that I hated this film as a kid. After viewing
it the other day on a whim however, I was surprised at how much better
I liked it now. The story centers around an evil mask-maker planning to
use ancient technology to murder millions of children on Halloween
night by selling them masks with a nasty little secret inside. I found
the story very interesting, though plenty of plot holes ultimately keep
this film from being all it could have been. 

The biggest obstacle in this film's way is the fact that it has nothing
at all to do with the other "Halloween" films made either before or
after it. That's certainly no reason not to give it a chance, though.
Perhaps it should have been called only "Season of the Witch" or
something so as not to anger the purists out there who demand the
presence of Michael Myers in anything with the word "Halloween" in the
title. That said, let's take a look at the good and not-so-good
elements of this film, shall we?

Like the previous entries in the series, this film has some creepy and
effective music. It is also buffered by some evil synthesizer sounds at
every turn. The little jingle set to "London Bridge" is annoying, and
I'm sure it was supposed to be. 

There are some interesting deaths, to say the least. Early on, we see a
robotic henchman pull apart a victim's skull, then blow himself up in a
car. One hapless woman gets an energy beam projected through her face,
leaving her mouth much larger than normal. (a bug then crawls out of
her head, foreshadowing later events) Another man gets his head ripped
completely off for threatening to torch the bad guy's factory. Later
on, a family is murdered in a test demonstration of what happens when
someone wearing one of these masks watches a certain commercial on TV.
Bugs and poisonous snakes form inside the mask and attack anyone in the
room. It seems the masks have some tiny pieces from one of the blocks
from Stonehenge implanted in the factory seal. Something about the
commercial triggers the effect within the mask. And just how does this
happen, you ask? "A good magician never explains," the mask-maker
points out in one scene. Sigh.

Some gigantic holes are present as the story unfolds. Tom Atkins, who
plays our hero, has a useless love affair with the daughter of an early
victim. If these two are so intent on solving a deadly mystery about
the death of her father, and bad guys are all around, would they really
stop to have sex? He is also much older than this woman. I guess since
Atkins plays a doctor, the young woman finds that sexy. Maybe I'd
better go to medical school if I want to score with hot young women
when I'm his age. 

Another problem concerns the time that these masks are supposed to go
off. We are told by the mask maker that when the commercial airs at
9:00 pm on Halloween night, all the masks will react and kill the
children. However, if it's 9:00 in California (where this takes place)
it would be 11:00 where I live or midnight on the east coast. Children
would mostly be in bed by then! Few parents would allow their kids up
that late to watch any "big give-a-way". The plan is to wipe out kids
all over the country, but it looks like only kids on the west coast
would be up when the commercial airs. If there was an explanation about
how this problem would be overcome, I missed it. I guess once again, "A
good magician never explains."

And just how in the hell did this guy steal a piece of Stonehenge,
anyway? He admits it was difficult, but again offers no explanation of
how it was done!

And how many freaking times did the female robot attack Atkins at the
end? I lost count. 

Well, it's not a total loss. It was a neat idea for a film, but they
shouldn't have glossed over so many things. 

I'll give it 5 of 10 stars. 

Happy Happy Halloween Halloween Halloween Happy Happy Halloween Silver
Shamrock!

STOP IT!!!! STOP IT!!!! STOP IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So sayeth the Hound.

Many viewers have bashed on this film, claiming it stinks and that it has
nothing in common with the other HALLOWEEN films. Well, let me tell you, if
you're a true Carpenter idolizer you'll see him written all over this.
Writer/director Tommy Lee Wallace didn't necessarily write the best script
in the world, but his direction is decent. The performances are kind of
stale, but they still come through. On the more positive side, Carpenter's
electronic score is one of his greatest in my book. From the eerie opening
to the chase sequence, the music fits the movie perfectly. Granted, the film
has nothing to do with Michael Myers and Haddonfield, etc., but it is the
same season, and Myers was supposedly BURNT TO A CRISP WITH HIS EYES SHOT
OUT!!!!!! in the end of HALLOWEEN II. HALLOWEEN III is definitely worth
viewing. And watch for Tom Atkins' wife in here: she's played by the same
actress who played Annie in HALLOWEEN (Nancy Loomis Kyes).
<|_=00=_|>

I've read almost all of the reviews here and honestly, I cannot argue with
many of the negative points that are raised here. The movie DOES use the
"Halloween" name while having only one tiny thread of connection to the
Michael Myers movies that came before it and would come later (and that
thread, involving a lab technician, can be charitably described as really
lame). It is boring in stretches, the idea of Tom Atkins hooking up with
Stacey Nelkin is pretty ridiculous, and the plot makes no sense if you
think
about it for more than 5 seconds.

But I don't hate this film. Why? That's very simple. The first rule of a
horror film is to scare the viewer and HALLOWEEN III has scared the hell
out
of me every time I've seen it! It's hard to pinpoint why, exactly, but the
atmosphere of the movie is a huge factor. This film is jammed with ominous
synthesized music (very 80's touch), cold and sharp-looking camera work,
and
a feeling of overwhelming dread and fear. It's very hard to establish
atmosphere in any movie or TV show; I was talking about this movie with my
brother--who said that he didn't think it was scary at all--and I compared
it to THE X-FILES. Both that show and this movie were able to quickly drag
me into their bizarre and frightening worlds.

I don't think I could flat-out recommend a movie with this many huge
problems, but I'd say it might scare the viewer, and that's not so bad
considering how many abysmal horror movies do nothing else right and
cannot
get that deceptively simple task completed, either.

A different animal to the Halloween films that preceded and followed
it, Season of the Witch is slowly but surely gaining an appreciation as
a standalone horror film. Gone is Michael Myers' indestructible killing
machine, in his place is the nefarious Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy),
the owner of the Silver Shamrock corporation that specialises in
Halloween masks. Cochran has a sinister plan this year - and it's
deadly - Dr. Daniel Challis (Tom Atkins) and Ellie Grimbridge (Stacey
Nelkin) are caught in the middle of the vile plot and may just be the
only salvation to Americana.

With Nigel Kneale involved in the writing process Season of the Witch
is delightfully fiendish. There's definite barbs being stung here about
the commercialisation of holiday occasions, that capitalism kills,
Cochran is intent on restoring Halloween to the true meaning of its
origins, creating a Silver Shamrock world order in the process. Kneale
would take his name off the credits when the studio tampered with his
vision, a shame because his core essence remains - even if Cochran as a
Warlock Wicker Man type could well have been genius.

With John Carpenter and Debrah Hill over seeing things from their
production chairs, the picture had supervision of some standing. Tommy
Lee Wallace maybe directing but it feels like a Carpenter movie, from
Dean Cundey's photography - Carpenter's foreboding synth musical score
 and the sharpness of the gruey horror scenes (which are excellent),
it's not hard to see the "non Michael Myers" Halloween series that
Carpenter had envisaged after part 2 had been and gone.

Boosted by an irritatingly potent advertisement jingle (a Silver
Shamrock variation on London Bridge is Falling Down) that counts down
the days to Halloween and the day of carnage, Season of the Witch is
consistently gnawing away at the senses. Having Atkins and O'Herlihy
propping up the acting helps, both are reliable performers for this
material, while the race against time finale has edge of the seat
credentials.

It doesn't all work of course, there's some drag and the narrative
feels schizophrenic at times, while if it wasn't for Cundey's camera
work then Wallace's inept direction of the non horror scenes would be
over exposed. Yet as it asks Halloween franchise fans some forgiveness
for not actually being part of the franchise, it delivers a smart
sci-fi horror hybrid that's not without shock and awe. 7/10
