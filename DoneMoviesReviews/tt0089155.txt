This movie is over the top hillarious - I don't know what hyped up dope that
the last person who left a comment was on, but I LOVE this movie!  What
really makes the movie is both Fletch's imagination, his flair for
developing different characters, and especially his speed talking.  examples
include "I love your body Larry (Geena Davis)" while on the phone in front
of a hotel clerk, "Nugent, Ted Nugent" when asked by Alan what his name was,
"What kind of a name is Poon anyways?" asks Mr. Boyd, to which Fletch's
reply is, "Comanche Indian".  This movie totally rocks and you will love
seeing it AGAIN and AGAIN!!!  It is so much better than jay and silent bob
strike back, you'll be laughing for hours!  enjoy!

Chevy Chase plays investigative reporter Irwin M. Fletcher, nicknamed
Fletch, who's disguising himself as a junkie on the beach to uncover a
smuggling ring. He gets spotted by Tim Matheson, a real estate
millionaire, who asks Fletch to kill him so his wife can receive the
inherit. Fletch goes snooping around and finds out that his smuggling
ring investigation might somehow be tied to the millionaire.

With a different leading man this film could very well have been a full
blown thriller. Imagine John Frankenheimer directing and Robert De Niro
starring. But, in dealing with what's at hand, Fletch is a good comedy
where Chase can showcase his range of disguises and delivery of good
one-liners. Chase absolutely smothers the film with wisecracks and the
overall very well constructed mystery is nearly overlooked. With
repeated viewings I've actually come to appreciate the film more for
it's genuinely gripping detective story elements, it really does boast
a solid mystery that unfolds well.

There's one thing for sure here; you have to be a fan of Chevy Chase
for this film to work for you. Since I'm a fan the film is in high
regard. Chase's wisecracks aren't all brilliant but they're mostly very
good and here he's at the top of his game.

Fletch and Clark Griswold are the two characters Chevy Chase will most
be remembered for.
<|_=00=_|>
Fletch is a refreshing departure from most modern crime/mystery flicks,
and cop comedies. Chevy Chase plays Fletch, an undercover journalist
with a penchant for clever disguises.

The film takes itself seriously, as we see Fletch run from place to
place making up names and solving the mystery. What makes this film
great is that it's not a comedy by nature, but that the character
Fletch is a comical man.

Thus, we laugh at him and the situations he makes for himself. The film
doesn't need to poke fun at itself, we have enough fun watching Fletch.

It's hokey at times, and some of the supporting actors can be a little
flimsy, but if you're interested in a great light-hearted mystery from
the 80's, Fletch is a great watch!
<|_=00=_|>

Chevy Chase's finest comedy. It's the part that he
really
sunk his teeth into. It's a perfect blend of humor, mystery
and
drama. Although Chase gets more mileage out of it because
of
the laughs, it's an intriguing character in all respects.

Michael Ritchie directs nicely and the supporting
cast
works well, particularly Libertini as Fletch's noisy and
brassy
editor in chief. This is a film that is filled with more classic
one liners than any film in the 1980's. It's one that makes
us miss the old Chase and wonder why he's planning to make
yet another "Vacation" movie.

We miss you, Chevy!

Class! just pure class, nothing long winded just short and sweet, made
at a time when chase was top of his class with others like steve
martin, as for the film its a good story with many many jokes most of
which you will have to see the film again to catch as some as they are
very fast such as name changes he comes up with, it still stands up
well today even if some jokes are lost on people to young to remember
certain peoples names, its a shame people like chase don't get the
films that made them so big in the 80s but times and tastes change, i
myself am a chase fan and this film is him doing what he does best.

"Fletch" (circa 1985), the original "Fletch" flick, features Chevy Chase at
his prime who, in his own inimitable way, plays a straight-faced, bemused,
fast-double-talking investigative reporter who solves a major drug
smuggling
operation. "Fletch" is currently on the cable merry-go-round and makes for
a
fun and entertaining watch for Chase fans or Chase fans to
be.

**Quote Spoilers Ahead** Oh man, what can I say? Chevy Chase has some of
the
best deadpan oneliner deliveries of his career in this hilarious comedy
about the shenanigans of investigative reporter Irwin M. Fletcher, alias
"Fletch F. Fletch", "Nugent; Ted Nugent", "Dr. Rosen-rosen, Rosen-penis",
"Igor Stravinsky","G. Gordon Liddy" Etc. Etc!!

I love how Chase's character plays off of such character actors as Joe Don
Baker, George Wendt, and M. Emmett Walsh. The they are excellent foils for
Chevy Chase's very funny and sometimes subtle jokes and
insults!

Some highlights of the film are the physical exam scene (Fletch refers to
Walsh's character as "Dr. Jellyfinger"!-Priceless!), The country club
scene
with such lines as " Yes, very good; I'll have the steak sandwich and... a
steak Stanwyk." And no one should miss the chase sequence thru the streets
of LA in a 'borrowed' Alfa Romeo Spyder! "Just gotta check the
fluorocarbon
output!","Hey Fred! How's the herpes? Does it hurt?". Which leads up to
the
improvised speech Fletch gives in tribute to "Fred 'the Dorf' Dorfmann",
the
father of "Internal Bushings"... "No more alcohol and sedatives in her
life."
So much is going on here, that repeated viewings are definitely
recommended
by this reviewer to catch all the asides and little moments to be had in
this film! I also split my sides during the autopsy sequence. "Have you
ever
seen a spleen this large?"-"Not since breakfast."

All in all, lots of action, general hamminess and a very good supporting
cast making this one a keeper for anyone's movie collection!
Highly recommended for comedy fans and a must see. One of the best
examples
of this type of humor!

"It's all ball bearings these days!""You and Tommy LaSorda?...I hate Tommy
LaSorda!""I feel like a hundred dollars.""Nice garage. Must've cost
hundreds.""...I saw the bright red Oldsmobuick of Mr. Arnold T. Pants,
Esq.
Attorney at Law.""Get me some gauze pads and 30-weight for that fetzer
valve... and clean those windows, they have filth and muck on them!""Does
this entail me dressing up as 'Little Bo-Peep'?"

Very Quotable... I give it an 8.8/10.

Spoiler
This movie is by far one of the most well-crafted scripts ever.  Every
joke
is put in the perfect place and Chevy Chase has the right dry humor to
deliver them.  In between the jokes is a decent plot of a journalist
Irwin
Fletcher aka Jane Doe (Chase) who uncovers a major story on drugs,
murder,
multiple wives and crooked cops.  This movie has it all.  It goes as
follows:  Fleth meets Allen Wyck who asks him to kill him.  Fletch
accepts
and later falls for Wyck's wife.  In the course of his love he spends
much
time on the beach hanging with junkies Fat Sam and Gummy--which is how he
stumbles onto the crooked cops.  Later investigating Mr. Wyck he learns
he
is married to a girl in Provo, Utah.  When it's discovered Fletch goes to
his ends to put it all together finding out that Police Chief Carlin is
in
cahoots with Wyck on a scam worth millions.  Fletch wins, gets the girl
and
so goes it.

With classic dialogue to be repeated throughout the ages, such as:  "I'll
have a Bloody Mary, a steak sandwich...and a steak sandwich.", "I was
going
to buy this place till I found out Butch Cassidy killed himself here.
Bow
and Arrow...very strange.", "What the hell you need with ball bearings?"
and
"Can I borrow your towel?  My car just hit a water buffalo."

I have owned this movie for years and laugh everytime I see it.
Disappointed as I was with the sequel "Fletch Lives", this is the keeper.
I
would recommend this movie to anyone who was looking for some laughs.

<|_=00=_|>

I sat and larfed my butt off when I saw this in Beeville TX summer '85.
And
it still holds up today, though the score is kinda crappy, still...you
gotta
love the get ups, the one liners, and the mystery, too, kinda works. Check
out the scene where joe Don Baker threatens Chevy with the gun...Baker
wasn't kidding. He was gonna do in Fletch right then and there. They had
just enough oomph in the mystery/police corruption angle to let you know
that this wasn't just Slapstick Chevy. It works.

I enjoyed seeing Jim Bob from the Waltons play a bit as a car thief, who
gets stuck in a car chase with Chevy, the Kareem cameo, hmmmm, and the
pretty generic blonde who Chevy gets at the end. She is quite nice,
doesn't
seem to have had much of a career...(Dana Wheeler-Nicholson?)

Overall, enjoyable, they coulda made 3-4 of these.

*** outta ****

In what may have been the high point of Chevy Chase's career, he plays
Irwin "Fletch" Fletcher, a reporter who writes a column under the name
Jane Doe. When a man hires Fletch to kill him, Fletch decides to
investigate the man. As you might imagine, in the process, he gets more
than he bargained for. And there's several gags throughout the movie.

Of course, since this is a Chevy Chase movie, you don't even really
need to pay attention to the plot. It's overall just an excuse for the
star to goof off. Maybe not as much as he did on "Saturday Night Live"
or in "National Lampoon's Vacation", but he's still funny as ever. He
must have had fun making this movie.
