I thoroughly enjoyed this comedy caper movie set in the Deep South, and I
can't understand why it has such a low average vote.
Kim Basinger and Jeff Bridges play a divorced couple who team up to solve
a
murder mystery and end up re-igniting their relationship. The two have a
good on-screen chemistry which, along with the comic-book-style humour and
plot, is what makes the movie.
All in all an enjoyable comedy/romance/thriller/caper/adventure affair
with
style and wit. 9/10

I say 'surprisingly' because the rating is so low, I didn't know what
to expect.

But it's a delightful little caper movie, driven (as all good movies
are) by the performers and a tight script by Robert Benton, not known
for his enjoyable caper movies!

Jeff Bridges all but steals the film from a delightful Kim Basinger,
and the two of them together set the screen on fire. They are
surrounded by some of the best character actors working today,
including Rip Torn. As I was watching this I thought how smart Robert
Benton is for casting real actors, and having the comedy come out of
their behaviour and talent, rather than casting 'wacky comedians' and
reducing the story to little bits.

A lot of fun, and worth seeing.

This film isn't very well known, and should be, especially for Kim Basinger
fans.  It proves once and for all that comedy is her forte, and that she
has
broad range between performances such as this and her role in "Fool for
Love" as a character actress, and not just a pretty face or an adequate
leading lady.  The chemistry between her and Jeff Bridges is  like TNT and
drives the film forward, and the added comic bluster of Rip Torn as the
villain (and the clever script and direction by veteran Robert Benton)
makes
this a comic gem in the true tradition of the 1930s screwball comedies, but
updated for the 1980s.  If you're a fan of such films as "His Girl Friday,"
and would like to see what that frenetic energy and great chemistry can be
like updated into the 1980s, see this movie!

Let me begin by saying I am just astonished to see the low average of
viewer comments for this splendid movie. I just have to figure the
commenters are a bunch of Yankees who never set foot in the South and
have no feel for the slow, quiet humor that this fine film represents.

But even that cultural adjustment doesn't explain the complete failure
of these other reviewers to appreciate a really finely drawn comedy,
from beginning to end. This is a wonderful work by the fine writer and
director Robert Benton, who defies the axiom, Comedy is hard. He makes
it look easy.

What he did was simple, looking back, but so very hard for most people
to do: He set up a funny plot and kept it funny from one scene to
another, by keeping it low key and letting the characters carry the
humor lightly, one slightly ridiculous moment after the other, thus
avoiding the great comedic danger: You can kill comedy by overworking
it.

Benton takes a plausible story about some Texas corruption and
discovered maps with some amusing twists to it and jacks it up with
some great dialogue and some fine actors -- mostly Southern, as it
happens: the fine actor Rip Torn (birth name, Ripley J. Torn, Jr.,
Texas) and Kim Basinger (Alabama). Robert Benton himself is from
Waxahatchie, Texas, and wrote the screenplay with full knowledge and
confidence of the plausibility of the plot and the reality of his
characters.

Folks, I know lots of people like these characters. So do you. Good
people, simple people, women who on the phone who soon ask, How's yer
Mom 'n 'em? And Benton has given them a moment of great adventure and
humor.

A few gems: Jeff Bridges: "I'm not in the Vernon Darlin' business
anymore." Basinger naming her early fetus Doris Isabel and talking to
her. Rip Torn: "Why is it you work your butt off all your life to get
ahead and it takes two nitwits about ten minutes to screw the whole
thing up." And in her most glorious beauty, Glenne Headley as the
girlfriend, full of Texas spunk.

I truly pity the Yankees and Californians west of Bakersfield who
cannot see the beauty of this film. But you know what? We don't need
you. This movie is like Elvis. It will live forever.

This movie easily makes it into my top 10. I loved it when it came out
in the 80's and still watch my VHS copy often. For some reason it just
struck a chord with me- my family often quotes lines from "Nadine" to
each other. I was quite puzzled to see such a low score and wanted to
add my opinion that it seriously does not get much better for this type
of movie. The script is excellent and it is perfectly acted. Jeff
Bridges and Kim Basinger are amazing together, but every character is a
scene stealer. The movie moves along at a good pace, with lots of
laughs and plenty of action. I highly recommend it, and it has really
kept its appeal, even 21 years later.

Okay, so this movie didn't do great when it came out in the late
eighties. I think it was because it was set in another era. But I
happen to think this is one of those movies that once you've seen it,
it stays with you. The plot is predictable, the action is a little on
the slow side, and it veers off funny a few times. However, that being
said, Kim Basinger single handedly MAKES this movie. Don't get me wrong
Jeff Bridges does a great job too, but it's Nadine that gives the movie
it's spark and it's wittiest moments. Basinger is picture perfect
because YES, she is beautiful, but she REALLy inhabits the dialogue and
her character. She acts beautifully and really seems to be having a
great time. My favorite two scenes are when Vernon and Nadine are
driving to the photography studio and later when they are alone in his
trailer. The scene in the car is all about dialogue and establishing
who these two are to each other and it's done amazingly well in a short
time. Basinger's dialect alone will make you laugh. "I don't know
Vernon, she look a little on the chubby side to be Pecan Queen" and
"You know me Vernon, they don't bother me, I don't bother them". She's
referring to her spark plugs. I don't know why, but I LOVE her in this
scene. It's just seems effortless. And the scene in his trailer, where
they are too close for comfort and it starts rekindling that old flame.
Chemistry is amazing in this scene, like they can barely exist near
each other.

I highly recommend watching this some night, where you don't have to be
up doing laundry or dusting your knick knacks. Pop some popcorn and
give this one a chance.

This is a very cute comedy caper movie. Kim Basinger is perfect as the ditsy
West Texas small town girl, and Jeff Bridges is great as her even dumber
husband. Rip Torn is also good as the villain. Plot is pretty simple, but
fun. I've shared this with several others in the 35+ year old class, and
they all enjoyed it. Very good chemistry between the
leads.

In 1954, in Austin, Texas, the sexy Nadine Hightower (Kim Basinger)
pays a visit to the photographer Raymond Escobar (Jerry Stiller)
begging him to retrieve the photos he took from her since she believed
that he would show them to Hugh Hefner. He gives an envelope to her
mistakenly with the plans of the route of a new road instead and while
she is waiting to leave his office, he is murdered bu his client.
Nadine becomes the prime suspect and when her ex-husband Vernon
Hightower (Jeff Bridges) visits her asking to sign the divorce papers,
he sees the documents and realizes that they are valuable. While Vernon
wants to make money with the documents, the powerful criminal Buford
Pope (Rip Torn) chases Nadine and Vernon to retrieve the plans.

"Nadine" is an entertaining romantic adventure, with Kim Basinger and
Jeff Bridges showing a great chemistry. Maybe the best thing in this
movie is the chance to see Kim Basinger in the top of her beauty and
sensuality. My vote is six.

Title (Brazil): "Nadine - Um Amor a Prova de Balas" ("Nadine Â– A Bullet
Proof Love")
<|_=00=_|>

This energetic comedy is entertaining the moment the title appears on the
screen. Set in a rural town a beautician witnesses a murder and then is
expected of doing the killing. Now she must run from the killers and the
cops. This movie is an instant classic. 10/10

my mom took me to see this when i was a kid in the late 80's and we
loved it. i had forgotten about it until i saw on cable recently.this
movie is adorable and just a good movie to watch one night when you are
cuddled up on the couch. i really love the way that basinger talks as
nadine.she is really a hoot. she and jeff have great chemistry. the
basic plot is a pregnant hair dresser who is estranged from her husband
finds herself drawn back to him when they stumble across a crime caper.
if anyone remembers this movie fondly i recommend ordering it online.

are a fan of kim , jeff or of romantic comedies in general
