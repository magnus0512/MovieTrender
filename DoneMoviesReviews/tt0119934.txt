Jaded by Hollywood's usually pathetic efforts to portray the real world of
sports, I was prepared to be disappointed by this movie. I grew up in
Oregon, attended U of O (the setting for much of the movie), and witnessed
some of the events portrayed. So it was with a surge of satisfaction that I
watched this movie that got it right at each point along the way. The
attention to detail was astounding, and the recreation of races was uncanny
- I compared it to actual news photos later, and the actors playing
competing runners were chosen so well that their bodies and running styles
actually match the original men.  When a movie cares this much about being
faithful to details, you can be sure it will take a quality approach
overall. Billy Crudup's portrayal of Pre is full of inner fire and
consistent with the real man; Donald Sutherland is marvelously powerful and
yet understated as Bill Bowerman; the examination of the real reasons
athletes compete is thorough and moving. Innovative use of music and camera
work brings the race scenes to life, and if this movie doesn't make you want
to immediately go out for "a quick ten," you're a completely hopeless
sedentarian-- in heart and body. This is among the five finest movies about
athletics ever made.

Though I liked PREFONTAINE, Steve James' version of the same story, this is
much better.  That was straightforward biography, where this captures the
poetry of running (James' film was prose, this is poetic).  As he proved with
PERSONAL BEST, Robert Towne understands the nuances of track and of
athletes.  Crudup is excellent as Steve Prefontaine, and even looks like a
runner.  And Sutherland gives the performance of his career as Bill
Bowerman.  I truly hope it lands him an Oscar nomination.  I also hope Towne
gets to direct more often, as all three films of his are
winners.
<|_=00=_|>

I've never been quite sure, whether it was Personal Best that strongly
attracted Robert Towne to running, or that he was already a big fan when he
began that project. Suffice it to say that when one of our greatest living
screenwriters brings his personal passion to his work, the results will be
exemplary.

"Without Limits' only became a movie, because Tom Cruise said so, and
thankfully he did. Where as the other Prefontaine bio-pic Â‘Prefontaine'
provided an honest, technical look at Pre's life and the sport of running,
`Without Limits' is more of a lyrical homage to the sport, the man, the zen
of it all.

The performances seamlessly intermesh with the story-Donald Sutherland is
good, as Coach Bill Bowerman, but Sutherland is always good..and I believe
his performance here has gotten more recognition as a result of  the way
Towne has organized his version-the Bowerman role is centerpiece, in
contrast to the more downplayed, subtler roles of the other principals.

Let Robert Towne do whatever he wants,  I will come and
watch.

This is definitely one of the best sports movies ever made as well as one of
the most unnoticed movies of 1998. Strange really, because "Without Limits"
is an amazing story about Steve Prefontaine. I didn't know it was a
biographical movie up until it showed the Olympics. So when I realized that
the main character really ran like the wind and had no physical obstacles he
couldn't overcome I instantly became an admirer of Steve
Prefontaine.

Billy Crudup, who truly stole every scene "even" in "Almost Famous" is
brilliant as Steve Prefontaine. His amazing transformation into the role of
America's fastest runner was absolutely amazing, and I had no idea who the
actor was, I only vaguely remembered his name. Donald Sutherland delivers
his performance of the decade and the very beautiful Monica Potter does a
great job as well.

The subtle manner in which the director chose to display Pre's life is
admirable and very touching. He truly was a role model. He's a role model to
me now, more than 30 years later. When he was explaining his running logic
to his coach I really understood his look on life. He wasn't planning on
being disappointed, he went the distance.

There's one more thing this movie deserves immense credit for. It made me
want to run. AND ACTUALLY ENJOY IT!!!!!!!       

A brilliant movie that made me think about my life.  8/10

I grew up in Eugene and saw almost every race Pre ever ran. He was a crowd
hero. There were always two races...the one Pre ran and the one, way back,
that the rest of the runners ran. There was nobody like him. He was
talented,  cocky and had so much charisma. He really was outspoken in the
press and took no guff from the AAU. He  was the best thing that ever
happened to track. Seeing the movie was like deja vu. It was a really well
done recreation of what it was like to be at Hayward Field during his races.
I went to the memorial service at Hayward Field and saw Frank Shorter and
Bill Bowerman speak. This movie certainly made me reflect
back!

Having run track competitively, I had a special interest in this film and I
was not disappointed.  This film dramatized the life of Steve Prefontaine, a
pre-eminent U.S. distance runner in the 1970's.

Though some of the details of his life were fudged for dramatic purposes,
the essence of Prefontaine was preserved, namely his brash egotistical style
of running and living.  In addition to its realism regarding the sequences
filmed on the track, this film gives a good account of the psychology of
running.  

Robert Towne did a fabulous job overall with this film, but especially with
the realism of the scenes on the track.  The dramatic element, focusing on
character development of Prefontaine as a person as well as a runner was
also well done, elevating it above your typical sports documentary and
improving its entertainment value.

Billy Crudup gives a fine performance as Pre.  He captures the arrogance and
the crushing disappointment of his life.  He was also terrific in the
running scenes. 

Donald Sutherland was also great as Coach Bill Bowerman.  Sutherland played
the part with the perfect balance of patient guidance and frustration as Pre
continued to ignore his prudent advice.  It was as if he were trying to
guide a lightning bolt.

This was an excellent sports story.  I rated it an 8/10.  Even for those who
are not fans of track and field and never heard of Steve Prefontaine, this
is an entertaining and absorbing film.

I have always been a huge fan of Robert Towne ever since I first saw
Chinatown. I haven't seen a disappointing film of his other than Mission:
Impossible 2, Without Limits was far from a letdown.

I'm not sure how much poetic license Towne used to make the film, for I
never have been a fan of running or any other athletics and so have never
really known anything about the characters, but like in the cases of The
Insider or Quiz Show I truly don't care as long as he didn't get too muddled
up in fiction.

 The story is well told with great performances and a superb soundtrack, the
greatest treat of all being Donald Sutherland's fantastic performance as
Bill Bowerman. This bit of acting makes me wonder how once again Sutherland
could be forgotten by the Oscars. With a career including such great roles
as in M*A*S*H, Klute and Ordinary People, the fact that he is still cheated
of even a nomination bewilders me, especially when this film came in a year
where the only true competition for such a performance was Geoffrey Rush's
scene stealing work in Elizabeth. (To all of you who agree with James
Coburn's win, I haven't seen Affliction.)

This movie truly handled the true life story of Steve Prefontaine with
care. The photography was stunning. It was filmed on location in Eugene
Oregon. Tom Cruise Produced the picture and his choice for director was
key. Robert Towne Directed and co- wrote the screenplay.

Most people think of Mr. Towne as a writer. His movies include the
screen play for Mission Impossible and the Classic, China Town. China
Town brought him both the Oscar and the Golden Globe for best Original
Screenplay. He has directed very few films over the years but the fit
for this project was on the mark.

Steve Prefontaine was a larger then life figure. To tell his story
right Robert really had to do his home work. He chose to film the
actual locations surrounding Prefontaines life. This really gave it a
realistic feel. To see the actual track where Steve broke almost every
long distance record on the books. The track where he was never
defeated. That had a lot of meaning. Just a side note: This track
today, is the site of the Pre- Classic. It's one of the worlds biggest
track events of the year. The worlds top track and field star's take
part in this event.

I had the good fortune to play an extra in this film. I owned a 1965
Pontiac. Warner Brothers was scouting out some car shows and asked if
they could use my car in the movie. ( you can see it in the outside
scene in front of the bar called, The Pad). Later I was asked If i
would like to appear as an extra. Of course i said yes. After a long
shoot the director, Robert Town came over and asked me to go to makeup.
He had a scene for me. I was to appear with Billy Crubup, who played
Steve Prefontaine and Monica Potter who played Mary Marchx his girl
friend. Although the scene was cut from the movie, i got to meet some
wonderful people. I had breakfast with Billy who turned out to be a
warm person and later met Monica who seemed to be lonely during the
long down times between takes.

As i was moving my Pontiac on the set, Donald Sutherland who was going
over his script for an upcoming scene, came over to me and told me how
much he like my car. I showed him around and he seemed interested. He
was really a great guy.

I bring all this up to point out that a lot of wonderful people who
took pride in their craft came together and put out a wonderful
picture. If you haven't seen it, watch it I know you will enjoy it.

A fascinating and unique story of the legendary American distance Steve
Prefontaine, who is portrayed here by Billy Crudup.  To be honest here, I
haven't seen the other film that was based on Pre's life ("Prefontaine"). 
This film places the majority of its' attention solely on the relationship
between Pre (Crudup) and his coach in college and the Olympics, Bill
Bowerman (Donald Sutherland).  Like Crudup, Sutherland is near perfect here
and should rank as one of his best performances.  The monologue that
Sutherland gives after showing television news footage of the infamous
massacre that tarnished the Summer games in Munich is just...flawless. 
Monica Potter is fine here as the girl who Prefontaine had the most interest
in.  Look for director William Friedkin appears early in the movie in a
small role.  The film's director/co-writer, Robert Towne is wise in how to
handle the drama and tension here and shows what a genius he is.  Now that I
look back at the film, I wonder if there'll be another great distance runner
to come from the U.S..  The answer might come in Alan Webb?  I don't know.

I love this movie. I was never really into running until I met all the
amazing people on my high school track team. and then I became great
friends with them and One introduced me to Prefontaine, and this movie.
Ever since Its been my motivation to keep running. when I get down I
watch it and i immediately want to go out for "an easy ten" and even
though I never get to 10 it still motivates me to work my best. and to
make me push myself to the greatest extent I can. Throughout the movie
Bowerman's quotes and just words to Steve and the other runners are
great advice and a great way to bring your team together. It worked for
my team and If you're a runner maybe it would work for yours too.
Prefontaine is a group hero and role model for my entire XC and
distance track team and it really brings us together. Pre was an
amazing runner and his legacy will live on in runners hearts and lives
forever. Pre was and is an American running hero.
