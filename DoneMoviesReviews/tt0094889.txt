Cocktail is a lot of things. It's a classic love story about finding
the right "rich chick". It's a sorted tale about an aging down on his
luck bartender who finds a reason to live. And it's also a feel good
film. It teaches you how to respect the desire. Be careful around
Elisabeth Shue. "And pretty soon, days get shorter and shorter, nights
longer and longer, before you know it, life is just one long night with
a few comatose daylight hours." And in the end, no matter how shitty
you are to people, they will always forgive you. Bryan Browns
masterpiece and Cruise is electric. It's another one of those movies
you could watch over and over. And in a little while, your want to
watch it again. If anyone hasn't seen this movie and doesn't plan on
it, than they are just retarded. Do yourself a favor, run down to the
store and buy it. You'll thank me.

As far as entertaining storytelling goes, Cocktail is an almost perfect
film. Here is an example of compelling dialogue, magnificent urban
cinematography, superb acting, and thoughtful editing combining to present
us with a very lucid portrayal of one man's coming to terms with the reality
of dreams and ambitions in our world.

Cocktail is ultimately the story of Bryan Flanagan's (Tom Cruise) reaction
as he doggedly pursues his ambition of getting rich, only to learn that his
dream was never really worth pursuing. A new arrival in New York City, the
"greatest concentration of wealth in the world," young Flanagan immediately
seeks to establish himself in the business world. Without an education or
practical experience, however, he suffers one humiliation after another
while job-seeking. Eventually he realizes that the business world demands an
education, so he enrolls in college and settles for a job as a bartender to
pay the bills. But then something extraordinary happens: he discovers that
he actually enjoys bartending more than he enjoys college, and that he is
challenged more by the mentorship of bartender Doug Coughlin (Bryan Brown)
than he is by the tutelage of his bitter, sadistic college professors.
Together, Coughlin and Flanagan develop the bartending equivalent of a
synchronized swimming routine that delivers them both the recognition and
money (in tips) they crave.

At this point, Cocktail could easily have degraded into one long, hedonistic
party, since the bartending action is certainly entertaining. But instead, a
falling out between Flanagan and Coughlin suddenly shifts both the tone and
the location of the film as Flanagan moves to the Caribbean to save money
for starting his own business.

In Jamaica he meets Jordan (Elizabeth Shue), a lovely, down-to-earth artist,
and for the first time in the film Flanagan truly falls in love with a woman
he takes to bed, and he seems genuinely surprised to realize that love has
been a more worthy goal than sex all along. With the re-introduction of
Coughlin's bad influence, however, Flanagan ignores what he has learned
about love and pursues a wealthy benefactor, Bonnie (Lisa Banes), breaking
Jordan's heart in the process.

Returning to New York City with Bonnie, which should have been the break he
has been waiting for, Flanagan instead suffers yet more humiliation in the
power game and finally comes to realize that he'd already achieved the
success that makes life worth living when he was with Jordan. So he burns
his bridges with Bonnie, and the remainder of the film focuses on his new
ambition, to win back the trust of the woman he loves.

This is a great story, one that requires the viewer to really challenge
Americans' preoccupation with money and power. Yet the beauty of Cocktail is
the smooth, realistic way in which this story is presented. For example, few
filmmakers today would risk losing the audience's attention by focusing at
length on Jordan's silent reaction to Flanagan's betrayal, yet these few
silent moments on a darkened beach say more than any amount of dialogue ever
could--but only if you're listening!

Cocktail is a wonderful story of love, ambition, opportunity, humiliation,
frustration, sacrifice, the absurdity of business and academia, and the
definitions of "success" and "failure," sprinkled with real-world humor that
is noticeably different--and funnier--than mere comedy. It is also an
exciting and fun film to watch, a "feel-good" movie of the highest caliber.
I take my hat off to everyone who worked on this fine film.

Tom Cruise stars as Brian Flanagan, who is fresh out the army and
finding that landing an executive job in the big city isn't as easy as
he thought. Taking on a course for a business degree, he winds up
working part time at a cocktail bar under the tutelage of bar tending
philosopher Doug Coughlin (Bryan Brown). A new world is about to open
up for both of them.

Right, I have the softest of soft spots for this movie. That doesn't
mean I'm not aware of its many failings, most notably the heavy weight
of predictability that pounds down on the head from the very first
frame. But as simple as it may be (oh this is plot line simplicity
decorated in flashy booze bottle twiddling), and the obvious cash in on
Cruise's box office appeal that it was (note that his next film was the
considerable shift to Rain Man), it's fun (thanks to Bryan Brown's
mugging) and sweetly romantic (thanks to Elisabeth Shue being sweetly
romantic). Yeah it's a hard sell I know! But Cruise charms in a way
that has his haters swigging the Alabama Slammers by the dozen, and
guys! Kelly Lynch pops up wearing a thong. Yeah I'm pretty shallow
where Cocktail is concerned, sue me...

All together now, "This magic moment" 6.5/10
<|_=00=_|>

Essentially, `Cocktail' is nothing more than your average Â‘popcorn flick'. 
However, it is a darn good one.  What was surprisingly nice about this film
was that it actually had a mature amount of depth to it.  It is also
overflowing with big-name stars such as Tom Cruise (Risky Business),
Elizabeth Shue (Adventures in Babysitting), and Bryan Brown (The Thorn
Birds).  But, the supporting characters happen to be so fascinating that at
times it's hard to focus on anything else.  In addition to this, the film
has glorious cinematography- especially the scenes set in the tropics. 
Another thing `Cocktail' has going for it is its soundtrack: great 80s
music!!  At its heart, `Cocktail' is nothing more than the same romantic
fluff you have seen hundreds of times before- but it is presented in such a
nice package that who really cares?

Tom Cruise what a performance , I think he touched all four bases with
this one,, however Bryan Brown steals the show for me,, add in Gina
Gershon and Elisabeth Shue, what's not to like,, a college student
trying to make money has trouble finding a job,, so he finds a bar to
work at part-time while he goes to school,, their he meets an older
gentleman who gives him a chance to be the bartender, he learns all the
tricks of the trade and things seem to be looking up for our main
character, he plans on marrying his sweetheart but he has trouble
managing his relationship,, the bar, and going to school,, things start
going a little south for our mentor as well, when he get's involved
with a woman that he really shouldn't, this movie is well packed with
some action,, some lighthearted moments, a lot of serious moments,, and
tons of laughter,, this is one of tom cruise's better earlier efforts I
felt,, what an enjoyable movie to watch,

God only knows in my lifetime I've dealt with a lot of bartenders, I
still do now when I go in a place and only order non-alcoholic
beverage. But unless it was a topless joint where the bartenders were
required to do more than pour and converse and maybe toss out an
occasional drunk, I never did see one do the Hippy Hippy Shake. And
here Tom Cruise does it tandem with Bryan Brown.

Still Cocktail is an entertaining enough film with Tom Cruise now
settled into the parts he usually plays as an all American social
climber. Tom's fresh out of the army and his first stop is his uncle
Ron Dean's bar in Queens. He probably could get a job with his uncle,
but Tom aims for higher things.

The problem Tom has in looking for a job is that old adage, what kind
of work are you out of? He tries in all kinds of places, but he has no
experience. An exhausted Tom arrives at an upscale bar presided over by
Bryan Brown and the two of them hit it off. Brown teaches Tom all the
tricks of the trade in bartending and hustling.

Bartending on the Upper East Side is a whole different world than the
working class of Queens. In fact right around the same time Cocktail
was out the tragic murder of Jennifer Levin by preppie killer Robert
Chambers was introducing via the tabloids of the world of the yuppie
bars of that vicinity. It was the world of Cocktail brought to a
gruesome reality.

The women come and go for both Cruise and Brown. Success turns out to
be ephemeral. The key scene in the film for me is that where Brown
after marrying East Side princess Kelly Lynch and her father's money
has backed him in opening the most posh establishment on the East Side,
he confesses that he doesn't know the first thing about really running
a business. Running a bar/restaurant is a lot more than pouring drinks
and dispensing wisdom. Turns out Brown hasn't got that much wisdom and
his realization of that leads to tragedy. It's a beautifully played
scene, the best I've ever seen from Bryan Brown.

Elizabeth Shue as Tom's East Side princess is very appealing, but I
also like Ron Dean as Cruise's uncle who really does have a lot of
wisdom and he doesn't think that he has it simply because he pours
drinks.

Brian Flannagan in Cocktail became one of Tom Cruise's staple roles and
further endeared him as our number one superstar. Still I've yet to see
a real bartender do the Hippy Hippy Shake.

Wow, a brilliant film if indeed there was one. The best film of Tom
Cruise's career for the simple fact that it has everything you expect
to see in a Tom Cruise film, his mentor played by Brian Brown is
excellent and the many pretty girls and exotic locations and romance
make this a great film to watch 100 times in one day and keep you up
beat and in the mood to drink a sex on the beach and go on a vacation.

This film has a surprise twist towards the end and a truly inspiring
final ending which provides every young man with a dream with hope and
excitement. The perfect follow up to the previous success of Top Gun.
10/10.. and I will watch it again. Cocktails & Dreams.

It's been years since I saw Roger Donaldson's "Cocktail" for the last time.
I remember it well enough to say that it was almost phenomenally standard
love story/drama from the producers of Hollywood. It's actually hard to name
a flick that's more basic in its own genre. Usual stuff or not, there was
nothing wrong with it as long as the audience doesn't expect anything
profound or ingenious. One user described "Cocktail" as "entertaining
trash". I couldn't possibly agree more. This was one of Tom Cruise's first
hit movies (alongside with "Top gun", "The Color of the money" and "Rain
man"). It was his late 80's "pretty face" period. "Born on the fourth of
July" started Cruise's career as a more serious actor and look where we are
now. He played the leading part in Stanley Kubrick's final masterpiece in
1999 and the man still going strong.
<|_=00=_|>
"Cocktail" from 1988 is one of the films that solidified Tom Cruise's
superstar status. He stars in this film with Bryan Brown, Lisa Banes,
and Elizabeth Shue.

Cruise plays Brian Flanagan, a young man with a lot of dreams of making
big bucks. After getting out of the service, he relentlessly seeks a
job in New York City, finally snagging one as a bartender in a upper
east side, trendy bar, where he works alongside Doug Coughlin, his
boss. Before long they're an attraction in and of themselves, throwing
bottles to one another, finishing off each other's drinks, all the
while dancing, turning, and gyrating.

Brian goes to business school as well, but given his late nights, it's
exhausting and not very fulfilling.

He and Doug both have dreams of owning their own bars, and the two
become great friends. However, after a huge fight, Brian goes to
Jamaica and runs a bar there, making good money and falling for Jordan,
a pretty waitress (Shue). Then Doug shows up, having married rich, and
when a very classy, upscale woman (Banes) comes to the bar, Doug bets
Brian that he can't get to first base with her. He does, and Jordan
sees him do it, and drops out of the picture.

Back in New York, Brian finds out living with a high-powered woman is
no picnic - in fact, it's pretty humiliating -- and he runs into Jordan
again.

"Cocktail" doesn't have much of a plot, but it has two very attractive
leading men, sexy Bryan Brown and, of course, Cruise, handsome even
with his old nose and looking quite different than he did in "The Color
of Money." He's very charming,likable, and exudes a lot of youthful
energy. He has some emotional moments, too, which he handles well.

"Cocktail" is a light film aimed at a younger crowd than I was even in
1988, but anyone can enjoy its swinging New York atmosphere, lazy
Jamaican sun, great soundtrack, and two wild bartenders. Underneath it
all, it's about the dreams of youth and the reality of being out in the
world. That's a message everyone learns pretty quickly.

Cocktail (1988) 

** 1/2 (out of 4) 

Blockbuster about a young man (Tom Cruise) who dreams of having money
and fame but soon his bar-tending skills lead him to Jamaica where he
falls in love with a woman (Elisabeth Shue). COCKTAIL was a gigantic
hit when it was released and looking back on the film you can't help
but see it like so many other hits of its day. While the film remains
slightly entertaining there's still no question that the story itself
is downright stupid and contains some pretty idiotic moments
throughout. One of the most embarrassing scenes happens towards the end
of the picture between Cruise and the woman's father but I won't spoil
this scene for those who haven't seen the film. A lot of the movie just
seems to happen for no reason other to try and jam every type of
emotion down the viewer's throat. Again, I'm not going to spoil what
happens to one of the major supporting characters but this little twist
just doesn't work and really goes against everything else we've seen in
the film. With that said, there's no question that Cruise is in fine
form here as he was really finding his own. Shue is also extremely good
in her role and the two stars share some really good chemistry. The
same for Bryan Brown who adds a lot of fun with his supporting role and
the magic between he and Cruise certainly helps the entertainment
factor. Kelly Lynch and Gina Gershon can also be seen. The film's
biggest highlight is the terrific soundtrack, which has everyone from
The Beach Boys to John Mellencamp. COCKTAIL is an entertaining movie
but at the same time it's quite shallow and really starts to slow down
towards the end. Fans of Cruise will still want to check it out even
with the flaws.
