Hmm.  You know, sometimes I wonder why we're screwed up as a species.  I
was
watching Extreme Ops in the comfort of my home and suddenly the world
fell
silent, and a wave of emptiness fell upon me as a poorly matted Bridgette
Wilson escaped a fake avalanche just in time for a ski jump to take out
some
excruciatingly recycled terrorists who were busy being evil for no other
reason than because the script says to.  I looked around to find myself
in
alien surroundings.  My home was no longer my home, but a void of
everlasting darkness in which no form of goodness, nor light, nor hope
could
ever be found.  And from the belly of this neverending realm of pain and
celluloid death could be heard the sound of English actor Rufus Sewell
dismantling his once promising career with lines of dialogue like "Are
you
ready to know what it's like to ski in front of an avalanche?"  Oh, the
pain.  Soon, all this agony ceased, and numbness set in.  My world shrank
and suddenly I felt nothing at all, and I realized that everything I had
ever done was meaningless, and all I had was nothing at all so long as
Devon
Sawa continues to hang from a cliff and ask a girl out in the middle of a
terrorist attack just before feigning suicide for "team sacrifice". My
God,
my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

But then, something happened.  The darkness parted, and the shroud of
peril
lifted and I awoke from my numbness to find that I was in deed at home.
My
furniture was still here and all my things were as I had left them.  I
wondered to my self, "What happened?"  And then I looked to my television
and saw credits rolling.  The deed was done.  And the darkness had gone.
But only until the sequel.  (Fat chance)

This movie sucks.  I hate it almost as much as it hates me.

What didn't work and things i learned: 

1. If you are a director or group leader, don't worry about your
group's health or the safety of your job because constant drinking,
unprofessional ism, snowboarding on the back of trains are what make a
director Extreme.

2. If you are a gold medalist,that is not "respectable" or Extreme.
Thus you should hang out with a bunch of amateurs to become Extreme.
Also, drinking and falling under peer pressure is OK if you want to be
Extreme. 

3. I don't know about you, but if your going to set up a love story, at
least let it come to it's conclusion. No date or kiss scene? Weak.

4. Silo's entrance and character was just ridiculous and laughable. The
whole skateboarding scene on the train is the first example of how
Extreme ops tries to be too "Extreme". Good job dude, that's one
Extreme dumb ass right there. 

5. Every Extreme person has rock entrance music to show he is more
Extreme than others.

6. A good camera man SHOULD ALWAYS hang upside down beneath a moving
train for the best camera shot. 

7. A snowboarder SHOULD ALWAYS grind their board on their train tracks
while chanting like an Indian if they want to be Extreme. 

8. Snowboarding off the top of a roof and doing back flips onto the bar
was just complete BS. Why would you fill up alcohol in glasses when you
know there just going to knock them down? It's either: A. There's a
dumb ass bartender B. There dumb ass customers who spent money to fill
the glasses up to look "Extreme". Take your pick.

9. Snowball fight inside the resort was really misplaced, especially
after meeting a creepy guy

10. The dog escape scene was really misplaced. It felt like a fight
scene but then it didn't. Especially with the garbage can lid slide
scene down the mountain. Also, that's the best time to videotape. Dumb
ass.

11. The night time snowboard/ski scene was misplaced. What did it
accomplish? Nothing at the end since it's accomplished in the hot tube
scene.

12. Director trademark: Why not throw some sexy panty action at the
cliff "over the edge" scene where Kittie is about to fall to her death?

13. Always say bastard and smile when your being shot at.

14. You SHOULD NOT fill a helicopter up before taking off. 

15. Shotguns are the best long range weapons for killing. 

16. Uzi and AK-47 ammunition is rare. So use a shotgun as directed.

17. Generals do not have good shooting skills. 

18. Throwing rope down onto helicopter blades is not Extreme. Instead
you must jump across the blades and throw the rope down. 

19. Always throw hot coal into a hot tube with people in it. 

20. Terrorist generals only have 4 men under the control at best. 

21. Being shot in the arm by a shotgun will have no effect, if you are
Extreme.

22. Being dropped on by a girl who weighs 105 pounds when you yourself
are 6 ft about 250 will instantly knock you out. (Note: If you are the
girl dropping on the guy, you will not be hurt if you say words like
"totally" "radical" "narly" after wards) 

23. What information did the helicopter pilot trade? What else was
there to learn? 

24. If 2 people need to ride on 1 snowboard, you will still move at the
same speed, and your maneuverability and control will be crisp clean
accurate.

25. When your a inexperienced amateur, listen to your buddy who tells
you to cut the rope if your about to fall. 

26. Cameras are now made with bullet proof covers. 

27. Being shot at in the chest will also have no effect if you are
Extreme. 

28. Trying to plow your snowboard into a helicopter to hit someone is
your best weapon.

29. As an adult it's a good idea to let one of the kids sacrifice
themselves for the benefit of the team. 

30. As an adult, leave a kid to watch someone wounded while you get
help with 2 other adults. 

31. When you return to the states, DON'T notify the press of the ordeal
you went through. Instead go get your money 

32. Cell phones will have good reception in mountains when enemies are
nearby but will have poor reception when there is no threat. 

33. Make sure to videotape when you just got out of a life or death
situation and are followed by a avalanche.

Overall not a great movie but at least the casting (exception of a few)
was alright.

I couldn't resist with that one line summary above.  Actually this film
wasn't a total stinker.  It had some good points, a lot of low points as
well, but still some good stuff to be seen.

I thought the story was actually a rather interesting idea.  It could have
definitely been a great movie, with the right director.  I did like some of
Christian Duguay's work ("The Art of War" and "Screamers"), I'm not really
sure what happened here.  I want to blame the writing and the editor...but
I'm sure that the director is also to blame here.  Speaking of editing,
there was some HORRIBLE editing in this film.  There were a few scenes where
I couldn't help but ask myself "What the heck was that?!?!"

The characters in the film were all pretty good ideas, just not executed
correctly.  The two characters that were supposed to be super adrenaline
junkies were good ideas, but weren't done justice.  I'm not saying the
acting was horrible or anything like that, I'm just saying that some of the
things they were doing didn't look "cool", just plain stupid!!!  There were
a few stunts that they did that were really cool though, so it wasn't a
total bust.  I did like the snowboarding off the back of the train, that was
kind of cool.

The action in the film was actually really good at times.  But, it was very
often short-lived.  I was shocked how short "the chase" in the film was
between the terrorists and the good guys.  At the end of the film, I was
thinking "That's it???"  ...And as for the actual final moments of the
film...well, let's just say it could have been better.

Most of the actors did a fine job.  Rufus Sewell did a fine job as always. 
Ever since I saw him in "Dark City" I've really liked his acting and tried
to follow his work.  Devon Sawa did a surprisingly good job, I usually don't
like his acting, but did a pretty good job in the film.  Bridget Wilson did
a great job with her role and looks absolutely fantastic throughout the
film.  She is reason enough to watch the film.  Jana Pallaske is a new face
to me, she did an ok job with her role.  I didn't think she was spectacular,
but she did pretty good job given the material (and is quite the looker as
well...her lips remind me of Angelina Jolie).

All in all, I can't in good conscience recommend you go see this film in the
theater unless you just want to see some cool snowboarding/skiing footage. 
I strongly urge you not to pay a full price ticket, see this one at a
matinee if you absolutely must.  Otherwise, wait till video.  Thanks for
reading,

-Chris

well, this movie is really some waste of time... maybe they put a lot
of effort into it, but don't watch it if you have better things you can
watch :)

it's not all that bad, the stunts are sometimes good, but the whole
thing is just not credible, the action is coming and going, the plot is
not good, the facts are wrong... Yugoslavia has no border with Austria,
the Austrian after-ski parties aren't like that at all, you would
actually get you as* kicked if you do that kind of thing in Tirol...
lots of things don't add up... then the characters are badly built up -
no personality... no idea why Ian talks to his g/f all the time...
well, you'll see for yourself...

Oh, and if there's someone doing the stuff these guys do, and
succeeding every time on the first try... well, I quit snowboarding :)

This movie looked great. I really wanted to see it. But it was a
disappointment. Why? This movie has no plot at all.. There's a group of
people making a commercial and a terrorist (or whatever). And that
terrorist
wants to kill that group. Well, at least 15 minutes before the end. The
movie is based on stunts, stunts and again stunts. I was so sick of the
snow
and skiing. I wanted to see an ACTION movie, not a typical show about
extreme sport. 
<|_=00=_|>

Great original, imaginative, extreme action and fabulous stunts
make this a great watch for all. I just loved the the scene with the
boarders jumping off the roof of a train and then roped on to the
train go for a joy ride until their boards catch fire whilst riding the
train tracks in a tunnel. And that is the tip of the iceberg and most
of the action is real, it is not CGI! So my verdict is great stuff and I
will be going again and again.  
<|_=00=_|>

This film is bad filmmaking 101. A commercial director (Rufus Sewell, who
has certainly done better work elsewhere) assembles a group of extreme
athletes (including Bridgette Wilson-Sampras as a Gold Medal Skier??) and
lugs them off to  a secluded area of the Swis Alps to film them outracing an
avalance for a DV Camera commercial!!!  Of course the same hillside out
intrepid filmmakers choose is the hidding place of some terrorist leader,
who thinks the bumbling and arguing film crew are actualy CIA Agents trying
to nab him! Of course the first hour or so is taken up by inane banter among
the athletes, including a raver chick (a dead ringer for early Angelina
Jolie) who thinks Sampras gold Medal skier isnt hip enough to be in their
crowd... Eventualy, after the obligatory Hot Tub bonding scene, we get to
some action when the bad guys chase out heroes down the slopes in a
helicopter! Of course the ending is so rediculous that you'll just laugh at
the ineptitude of the screenwriters.  This is a terrible movie from start to
finish. GRADE: F

Will (Devon Sawa) is a Hollywood producer who excels at making
commercials with some extreme sports fanatics on centre stage. When an
opportunity arises to do a big-league advertisement, he decides to film
it against an actual avalanche. He hires Jeffrey (Rupert Graves) as the
director and heads for the Austrian Alps near the Yugoslavian border to
film the spot.

His team consists of Ian (Rufus Sewell), Chloe (Bridgette Wilson) and
Kittie (Jana Pallaske), three extreme sports connoisseurs who love
staring the storm right in the eye. To film such a daring and
precarious commercial they need an equally adventurous cinematographer,
who turns out to be Mark (Heino Ferch). Together, these six individuals
land up in an under construction resort. They start filming, unaware
that the place is also the secret hideout of Slobodan Pavle (Klaus
Lvwitsch), a Serbian war criminal who is believed to have died in a
plane crash. Mark erroneously catches Pavle on tape who believes the
six are actually CIA operatives. Pavle orders their execution lest they
should blow the whistle on his whereabouts and his latest plans to
wreak havoc. Thus begins a battle of survival as the protagonists use
every trick and ploy they know to survive and bring down the evil
Pavle.

From the story and the trailers, Extreme ops may sound like a flick for
a selected audience. Although the movie does not have much of a plot or
situations that are aesthetically appealing, the numerous incredible
and ingenious action sequences ensure that one stays glued to the
couch. The film can be enjoyed only if one watches it without any
expectations!

Unless you are really into skiing and watching people ski and snowboard
for a good part of an hour and a half and watching people run around in
white cold fluffy stuff, just go to bed.

It's not a very entertaining movie and the dialog is lame.

There's snow and lots of it...and a few nice shots - actually quite a
few, but that's the highlight.

Take away the gangster scenes and basically what you have is a
documentary about skiing and snowboarding.

The Olympics skier is told she can't ski...yet she's on a dangerous
mountain melting the snow - even though she takes a flip...she's doing
some pretty awesome moves.

Hollywood has always been quick to react to new trends if it believes
it can make money from them, and at the beginning of the current decade
the movie studios responded to the increasing high profile of so-called
'extreme sports' by using them as the basis of a short-lived wave of
action movies. Of course, the film executives failed to take into
account that those interested in extreme sports are far more likely to
be taking part in them, attending such events, or watching TV/internet
coverage of them, instead of going to see movies in which actors
pretend to take part in them. So while xXx (starring Vin Diesel) was
successful enough to secure a sequel, Extreme Ops failed to make an
impression at the box office, and the notion of extreme sport action
movies died out as quickly as it had begun.

Extreme Ops (which was filmed under the title The Extremists, but
swiftly retitled before release due to the events of 9/11) is an
international co-production with an appropriately international cast of
American, British and central European actors. The storyline has a film
crew, together with a pair of snowboarders and a female gold
medal-winning downhill skier, travelling to an unnamed European ski
resort off-season, to shoot footage for an advertising campaign.
Unfortunately, a wanted Serbian war criminal is using the isolated
resort as a temporary hideout, and the film crew eventually find
themselves fleeing down the mountainside with the Serbian and his men
in determined pursuit.

However, that particular plot development doesn't occur until
two-thirds of the way through the movie, so for the first hour we
merely see the film crew, snowboarders and the skier hanging about in
the empty resort, occasionally filming on the slopes, and bonding over
bottles of beer while relaxing in a hot tub.

It sounds deadly dull, and considering that the characterisations in
the script are tissue-thin, it should be. But due to the efforts of the
talented cast, these irresponsible risk-takers (the snowboarders and
most of the film crew are die-hard adrenalin junkies) come across as
surprisingly likable. As a result, despite being routine in practically
every aspect, Extreme Ops is a remarkably engaging movie.
