Just to be up-front about this - I enjoy these films. The original -
Highlander - was the only one in the series which really stands the
test of time (Endgame has now joined it in this), and stands head and
shoulders above the others for artistic merit and originality, but
still, I liked the others well enough. 

I also like the much maligned Christopher Lambert. He's an odd actor to
be sure - far from the Hollywood norm in appearance, style and accent,
but he's nothing if not original and once you understand his
understated style, you might just see that the guy has some serious
talent. Read on if these statements resonate with you. Otherwise, feel
free to move on without reading or rating this review.

Lambert is good, Unger is good, Van Peebles is campy as hell,
alternating between absurdist humor and menacing poseur-ship.

The script is OK, certainly less grandiose and more mindless than II
(and closer to the original in feeling, pace and plot), but not
particularly original.

The production values are a slight step up from II, about as good as
Endgame, and almost up to the original's standards.

Conor McLeod has reclaimed something of his humanity - imagining
himself to be the last immortal on earth, but of course, he is wrong.
Sorcerer Kane, who has stolen the magic of one of McLeod's former
teachers, is hunting his head. McLeod has adopted a child and is about
to fall in love again, the last thing he needs is an attack by an enemy
who has no corporeal body.

The film is entirely predictable, and is nothing more than a fan film.
So what? It's harmless entertainment with some very pretty scenes from
Scotland and some other gorgeous landscapes, and, if you don't expect
much, you might just have a good time with it.

In 1995, with the enormous international success of the "Highlander" TV
series, producers Bill Panzer and Pete Davis once again teamed up to
unleash another "Highlander" sequel upon us. This time, it's
"Highlander III: The Sorcerer" or, as it was known in the U.S.,
"Highlander: The Final Dimension". (Don't ask me where the hell that
came from) The film finds Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) enjoying
a peaceful life with his adopted son, deceived that he has won the
Prize. However, the evil sorcerer Kane (Mario Van Peebles) has broken
free from the Japanese mountain he was entombed in, and now he wants
the Highlander's head.

One of the parts of the film I enjoyed the most was Christopher
Lambert's portrayal of Connor. For once the character isn't a severely
depressed maniac, and in fact, he's better in this film than any other.
Mario Van Peebles makes a good, if not unbelievable villain, with
Deborah Unger as the sexy Highlander girl.

Andy Morahan's direction is good. The script is good and very
entertaining, but the film's problem is this: although it has all the
right materials to make a good film, they are either wasted, put in the
wrong place or dropped quickly. It makes you wonder if the franchise is
cursed.

The film's score, by J. Peter Robinson, was very nice as well. Loreena
McKennit's "Bonny Portmore", featured twice in the film, is a beautiful
and outstanding song that has now become the theme for the series.

All in all, while "Highlander III" (Sorcerer/Final Dimension) is an
entertaining film, it can't come anywhere near comparing to the
original film, although it is a major improvement over "Highlander II".
<|_=00=_|>

What can I say, Highlander was the kind of movie that simply does not allow
for a sequel.

Highlander III may be enjoyable, but certainly doesn't come anywhere near
the original one, which is a Classic. There are so many things that
impressed me in Highlander; sadly, I can't say much about Sorcerer.

Watch it, but don't expect too much.

This is definitely more of a sequel than Highlander 2: The Quickening was. 
With respect to the first Highlander this film actually follows it pretty
well.  It's funny though because it totally disregards the existence of
Highlander 2.  In Highlander 2 they show Brenda Wyatt (the main girl in the
first Highlander film) dying from the effects of a depleted ozone layer, but
in this film they mention that she was killed in a car accident.  Anyhow, if
you pretend that Highlander 2 doesn't exist, this actually makes a good deal
of sense with regard to the original Highlander.  The only qualm I have with
the film is how could Connor MacLeod think he has "the prize" when there are
still 3 more immortals out there?  That doesn't really seem to make sense,
but maybe some die-hard Highlander fan can explain it to
me.

Anyhow, all in all, I thought this was a really good film.  I loved all the
actors, Christopher Lambert does a great job as Connor MacLeod as always and
I was really impressed with Mario Van Peebles, he did a fantastic job, and
looked really menacing throughout the film.  Deborah Unger was a nice
addition, she's definitely a looker, and not a bad actor
either.

The story was pretty good, but it's nothing terribly complicated.  The
special effects are very nicely done.

I'm not a die-hard Highlander fan, but I do like the films, and I thought
this film was great.  I hope you enjoy the film as well.  Thanks for
reading, and be sure to read my other Highlander reviews.

The other reviews say it all : you will have a good time watching this film
if you don't expect something too smart or original but just wish to be
entertained with some action and fantastic images.

But I wish to add that paying attention to the music is also worth the
shot.
From the eerie chants in the most unsettling moments to the timeless Celtic
songs accompanying the grandiose shots and peaceful passages, the music is
a
faithful and enhancing companion to the plot.

First of all Highlander III: The sorcerer is the french title used for this
film, I just thought I'd clear that up real quick.

Those of us that live in America know Highlander III as Highlander: The
Final Dimension. 

Highlander is heavly criticized due to the fact that Highlander II: The
Quickening came before it. I look at it this way, Highlander II is like
Halloween III it has nothing to do with the rest of the series the only
exception is that it does involve Conner Macleod, unlike Halloween III which
doesn't involve Michael Myers at all. 

I did not see the theatrical version of Highlander: The Final Dimension, I
just recently came across a copy of the R rated Directors Cut of this film.
This cut of this film is excellent and it is a nice sequal to the original
Highlander if you forget about Highlander II.

I think I can understand why this film was criticized, the theatrical
version was probably released half assed with the scenes all cut
up.
The Directors Cut is pure and complete.

I'd like to comment on the love scene in this film between Conner and the
female lead, it is almost on a pornographic level and it is no wonder that
they wouldn't allow that to get into theatre's. It is greatly welcomed in
this release though.

Mako does an excellent Job as Macleod's new trainer at the beginning of the
film, he knows he is going to die and on at least three occasions gives
Conner the opportunity to take his head, he idiotically refuses and his
trainers powers fall into the hands of evil an evil that would hunt MaCloud
many centuries later. 

Those that say that this is a remake of the original are greatly mistaken
and should rent the directors cut of this film and watch this one
again.

MaCloud did win the prize in the original film, it just so happens that when
the sorcerer is resurrected the game begins again,Macloud is actually
defending the prize he already won, he gets an even greater prize when he
kills the Sorcerer, he recieves the powers and knowledge of his trainer and
his power of illusion, besides the overall prize.

Many have asked about Highlander: Endgame, this film only works if you think
of it as many years later, this film also is based on the television series
too, we have both Conner and Duncan in this one. IF you see the pilot of
that show Conner is there, we learned that he trained Duncan after finding
him almost dead after a battle.
This film pretty much wraps up that series and it tries to finish off the
film series as well, it is confusing but you can make sense out of it if you
try. The Villian in that film tops them all as he doesn't care about the
rules, in fact he breaks every one including the Holy Ground
rule.

If anyone else can figure out the link between Highlander I, III, the series
and Endgame, feel free to write another commentary with updated information
and your own thoughts of what if.

Highlander: The Final Dimension is under-rated and the Directors Cut of this
film should be viewed for best performance.

There can be only one, yes in the end there can be only one, we do not know
when the end will be, it could be the end of time for all we know, immortals
are always being born throughout the centuries and years, we don't know who
they are or where they are, at the time end of time one man shall stand
alone, at that point there can be only one, but it will be almost an
eternity before every immortal is killed in fact the game has the potential
to last an eternity.

Those were just some words to think about next time you watch any of the
Highlander films(except II) and when you watch the show.

First of all, let's forget Highlander II: The Quickening ever existed.
This is a great and logical sequel to the first Highlander movie.
Highlander II was a complete disaster and all copies of that movie
should be burned. This is a vital thing to keep in mind if you want to
enjoy any Highlander movie. Of course I did not expect much of this
movie since it has a 3.9/10 rating. I suppose most of you did not watch
the entire movie or simply fast forwarded it because of the disaster
that is The Quickening. Highlander III is a decent sequel and
unfortunately does not get the credit it deserves. If you enjoyed
Highlander, I'm sure you will enjoy Highlander III.

A good revenge plot drives this third Highlander installment. An old
enemy similar to the Kurgan of the first film, escapes an entombment
after 400 years and begins a quest for the head of McLeod. Kane- the
Sorceror -makes a great villain and blends into modern America easily
with his tattoos and piercings. The film also boasts some Conan
elements with Mako again playing a wizard named Nagano and there also
some f/x similar to T-2 as the sorceror's power is made apparent. Debra
Unger is also a plus as a smokin' leading lady who provides the best
and sweatiest sex scene of the "Highlander" cycle. There are also some
great locales used in the film. From snowy Japan to African deserts to
the Scottish Highlands, the film features all three beautifully. McLeod
also has an adopted son and is hounded by a new NYC detective who is
wise to his immortal habits. But through it all, he keeps his cool
demeanor. However, the soundtrack leaves much to be desired. 7/10.
Check out the DVD!

Christopher Lambert reprises his role as Connor McCleod who this time
goes up against an evil immortal Kane(Van Peebles in a terrible
performance) who is thawed out of suspended animation, of course once
he defrosts, it's up to McCleod to put him (back) on ice. I admit that
this is probably my favorite sequel, only because the beginning reminds
me of kung fu sequel, with Mako teaching Lambert swordsmanship and kung
fu, however that aside the movie is fairly uninspired but not too dull
and really it makes logical sense, even in comparison with the original
(The only sequel to do so.) The suspended animation thing is a lame way
to bring up a new enemy but at least it doesn't explain that they are
from a different planet, or completely contradict the original like the
fourth. The fight sequences are decent and the production values while
somewhat cheap play passably on screen, so overall it's a mediocre
sequel. Nothing special but at least semi-watchable.
