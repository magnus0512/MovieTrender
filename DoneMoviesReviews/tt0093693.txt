This is a comedy that doesn't suffer from time or repeated viewings. It
has
all the trappings of a true classic. The cast, Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell,
Edward Hermann and Roddy McDowall all put in good performances. The 4
child
actors all do very well, too. The story is a funny one and it keeps me
laughing. All in all, a very funny movie. I own it and will throw it in
the
DVD player every once in a while.

This is an A++++++++ movie! I loved this one. I was very unhappy when I
read
that 'Overboard' received bad reviews by the definitely brain dead
'critics'. I was working in a video rental store when this came out on
video. It was a MAJOR rental that was extremely popular with our patrons.
This was an excellent family oriented vehicle. Kurt, Goldie and Roddy were
absolutely fantastic! The film critics of today are in very bad form. I
think they are being 'paid off' by jealous competitors! Overboard is a
'feel
good' film that can excite the viewer! Wonderful! I would have liked a
sequel of sorts to this one! Kudos to the actors, writers, directors and
producers of this fabulous film! So sorry that you got panned by the petty
media! What counts is the VIEWER! If you haven't seen this film, I highly
recommend it! In addition to classic film lover's, Frank Capra would have
loved this one!

I watched this movie for the first time when I was 10 and still watching
it
to this day. The cast is excellent and the storyline is silly but you just
can't help yourself laughing at all of Goldie's screw-ups or Kurt's
incompetent ways of parenting. The supporting cast is great, what more can
I
say??, if you ever see this in the video store, it's worth renting. GO
OVERBOARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yeah, sure, you know how it's going to end. Yes, it has all been
done before. But the heart of this snob turned sweetheart story is
relayed with such charm and grace by Goldie Hawn and Kurt
Russel, and supported by such a strong cast (Roddy McDowall
among others), that it is enjoyable none-the-less.

Movie snobs, insisting on original plots (as if there really are any)
might not love this flick. But anyone who can appreciate proven
talent in a good-natured comedy will find these 2 hours time well
spent. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to smile.

Overboard is the kind of a fun movie to watch anytime. I saw it the
movie theater 14 years ago. Today, I still watch it on television or on
the video tape. It is truly a comedic classic not to be disregarded at
all. It is truly funny, entertaining, and enlightening. If haven't seen
it, you must for a good time. Great cast of actors and characters, I
miss Roddy McDowall. I wished that Roddy got knighthood while he was
alive. Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn have been together what must be
like an eternity in Hollywood or at least a few years. Edward Herrmann
has a great supporting role as Joanna's husband and Katherine Helmond
from "Who's the Boss?" plays Joanna's snobbish New Yorker mother. The
story begins with rich Joanna wanting a closet for her shoes so she
hires a local carpenter, Kurt Russell, who does not meet her criteria.
She insults and mistreats him like an animal and refuses to pay him.
When she falls overboard accidentally, she loses her memory. When
Kurt's character finds out, he decides to bring her home and make her
pay him back. The predictable event happens so watch and see and don't
watch the butchered television version either.

Being a guy must make the fact that I like this film so much a guilty
pleasure because it really is a chick-flick with capital C. I usually
do not like to rate romantic comedies very high unless they have a
different story and Overboard certainly has a different and (I think)
original story. If you can get past the fact that the male lead is
deceiving a woman with amnesia then you're going to love this movie.
The acting is very, very good. I don't usually like Kurt Russel but I
think he is near perfect in this role. Goldie Hawn is excellent and I
must say that she was quite good looking in her younger days. I never
really laughed out loud during the movie but I sat through the whole
movie with and involuntary smile on my face because of the cute dialog
and the slow change in the characters. The other cast members are also
quite good. I found Edward Herrmannto be the most interesting character
in the movie but he wasn't used enough. The emotions portrayed by the
characters seem genuine which is a nice change from many other romantic
comedies *cough* Pretty Woman *cough* and the on-screen chemistry
between Russel and Hawn was undeniable.

All in all a very recommendable and highly enjoyable movie.

8/10

This was a great film. I enjoyed it thouroughly! The casting couldn't have
been better and it was hilarious! The kids were great and made me laugh!
Kurt did another excellent job. All those who are fanatics for edge of your
seat thrillers, don't even comment on this movie, go see Soldier or
something, maybe you'll like that better. "Typical 80's trash" WHATEVER!!!
Just enjoy the story, I loved it. Kurt you are such a cutie and you and
Goldy belong with each other, (but I'm sure you already know that!)
10/10!!!

I like this film, and it has many memorable moments.  The hose scene, and
Russel's antics.  This is a great movie, Russel does comedy perfectly.  He
can play the all American, guy next store better than anyone else.  This
movie is a tribute to his acting ability.  I can watch this one over and
over. 8/10

Overboard is a fun movie! It's also one of those romantic comedies that
could have been really awful but manages, not only to be better then
average but MUCH better then average despite the "Hollywood" tone
through it. There are a couple of reasons for that number one being the
chemistry Between Russell and Horn. Unlike a lot of Hollywood real life
couples who do movies together and have NO chemistry, these two are the
exception. You can feel as you watch the movie how much these two
genuinely like each other-it shows in their work. They created a really
fun, feel good, romantic comedy that neatly avoids being either to
corny or to sappy. Instead it's just charming, fun and sweet-with a
touch of hilarity now and then.

The other thing that Horn and Russell do is make this unbelievable
story believable in a way. With other romantic comedies, for example
"maid in manhatten", your always aware your watching Jennifer Lopez
play a movie role. That happens in a lot of romantic comedies but in
this, the characters created are fun and unique and you can buy into it
without constantly thinking of the actors/actresses behind the roles.

It's rare that a movie can be THIS Hollywood and still come off as fun
as it did. This is one the whole family can enjoy. It's a lot of fun
watching The ritsy socialite with amnesia and the gruff carpenter with
the heart of gold as they start to soften toward each other and
ultimately fall in love. Best of all, the movie takes its time with
that and doesn't just throw events in,it never becomes boring and it's
always fun to watch.

Obviously, certain parts are unrealistic-but who cares? This is the
perfect movie to watch when your at home sick, or your tired and want
to perk up and it's also a great date movie as well as great family
fun! My rating is 8 out of 10.

Each time this movie appears on cable television I cannot help but
watch
it. I've probably seen it about 5 times by now. It is not the best movie
I've seen, but something about it is magnetic. Yes, the plot is as
predictable as can be, but it is a good story. The central characters are
likeable as well as some of the supporting players (especially Roddy
McDowall as Goldie's long-suffering servant).  It's a good movie if you're
looking for a few laughs and to feel happy, because that is what Overboard
generates.
