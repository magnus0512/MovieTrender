Not only is An American Tail easily one of the best animated features ever
made, but it proves to be leaps beyond the efforts of recent Disney movies
by refusing to be constricted to an all-too-familiar formula. This movie
does not stay within the cozy, comfortable guidelines that Disney adheres
to in order to make money. Instead, it tells a truly unique tale, one not
borrowed from any other source, and one overflowing with artistic wonder
and originality.

The characters you will see here are not stock, not pulled from the typical
Disney hat. The story is not a chuckle-a-minute, lowbrow attempt to take
the easy way out in pandering to children. The main character, Fievel,
suffers real hardships and tragedy, and stares into the despair of his own
soul before the movie is finished. This, of course, makes the ending that
much more satisfying, an infinitely more significant and authentic moment
than any cardboard cut-out Disney plot.

If you want to see what animation was meant to be as an art form, if you
want to feel the power and emotion that can truly be reaped from this
under-appreciated and over-commercialized medium, look no further than An
American Tail.

I remember seeing American Tail when I was very little, and I loved it. I
always felt sad for Fievel when he was away from his parents, and at the
time, I never knew that they were always very near him. I thought that they
were always far away from him like he thought. Not too long ago, I bought
this movie and watched it again...for the first time in years. I'm 17 and I
still love the movie. It's the ultimate animated movie when it comes to
being gentle, heart warming, and full of good heart. And the film is such a
wonder to behold, even after all these years. Despite another sequel and one
(or was that 2?) (one was made in 1999 and it's coming soon to video?)
direct to video movies. Out of the three I've seen, this one is still the
best, and it's among my favorite animated movies of all time

Ex-Disney animator Don Bluth brings us a tail (sorry, TALE!  Well, that's
the 
proper word in the context!) of the Russian Mousekewitz mouse family, who,
like 
all of the other mice in late 1800's Russia, want to escape from the cats. 
They 
dream of a land known as America, where there are no cats.  Travelling to

Germany, they board a ship bound for America.

However, during a violent storm, little Fievel Mousekewitz (voiced by
Phillip 
Glasser) becomes separated from his parents and sisters.  Fortunately for
Fievel 
he was saved from drowning by being ensconced within a bottle, which quite
by 
chance floats to New York, USA.  Unfortunately not only is America very big,
but 
it -- well, let's just say that for all mice concerned it's not all it was
cracked up to 
be.

With the help of friends such as Tony Toponi (voiced by Pat Musick) and
Tiger 
(Dom DeLuise), Fievel goes on a mammoth quest to become reunited with his

family.

Although it is a little on the sentimental side, it does have a certain
charm, which 
is further helped by James Horner's musical score, as well as the wonderful

song 'Somewhere Out There' which has since become my favourite duet of all

time (I've even sung the end-credits version, as sung by Linda Ronstadt and

James Ingram, on Karaoke!).  Some adults may not like the sentimentality,
but 
stick with it, and you'll be rewarded with a gem, particularly if watching
with 
either the young or the young-at-heart.

As a non-American who has heard so often of The American Dream, I saw this
movie as a celebration of that dream.  The flight of the poor and oppressed
(and Jewish?) from Europe to the proposed Land of Freedom and Wealth (There
are no cats in America and the streets are paved with cheese?) to find more
poverty and oppression (workhouses, cats and workhouse tout Warren T. Rat),
but with the opportunity to do something about it that they did not have in
the old country.

The song "Somewhere Out There" is quite perfectly matched with Fyvel and his
family searching for each other, and the version heard in the movie is
rather more expressive than the released single. 

It is not necessarily fun for the whole family.  Children will find it fun. 
Adults will find it interesting, not so much in fun as in pride and
awareness, at least if they are Americans .
<|_=00=_|>
In my opinion, this is an excellent movie for all ages that will warm
your heart! When Fievel (voice of Phillip Glasser) got lost, I wanted
to cry. Although some of the characters were diabolical, I liked
everybody. Well, it's hard to say which character was my favorite. The
music was good, especially "Somewhere Out There, "A Duo," and "No Cats
In America." In addition to the music being good everyone was cast
perfectly, and the direction was flawless. In conclusion, I highly
recommend this very touching movie for all ages that will warm your
heart to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for a real treat and a
good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with
someone close to you, and watch it.

I agree that the standards set by Walt and his animators are the only ones
that matter when it comes to judging animated films, and I had trouble
accepting this to, but there are OTHER ANIMATION COMPANIES!! No one would
dare describe "Shrek" (which sucked) as a Disney movie, so let's leave Don
Bluth alone, okay?

Having said that, this movie is absolutely wonderful. A heartwarming
story,
beautiful songs (including the now standard "Somewhere Out There") great
performances and the animation is stellar. Much darker and grittier than
any
story Disney would even dream of making, it revolves around an immigrant
mouse named Fievel, whose family comes to America to escape oppression
("In
America," says Poppa, "There are no cats."). Fievel learns the hard way
that
America has its problems, too.

In my opinion, this movie is worth seeing solely for Dom DeLuise's
characterization of the soft-hearted alley cat Tiger. All in all, this is
probably the best Don Bluth has ever made. 
<|_=00=_|>

"An American Tail" was Don Bluth's second animated feature since leaving
Disney, and, in my opinion, it is his best. It's got the most heart out of
all of his movies. It's got the Oscar-nominated song "Somewhere Out There"
and the main character of Fievel. This character just warms my heart and I
can easily feel for him. Don Bluth has made only three very good animated
features: this movie, "The Secret of NIMH", and "The Land Before Time". But
"An American Tail" tops them both. No matter how predictable or sentimental
the story is, I always get caught up in it. The sequel was good, but it was
more like a fast-paced western comedy with some one-liners and such sight
gags. The original is the better film in my opinion. Only complaint: one too
many chase scenes with Fievel and other mice running from cats.

<|_=00=_|>

I was introduced to An American Tail after perpetually reading the 'book' of
the second film, Feivel Goes West. I can't say which one I enjoyed more
although at the time, I think I was seven, but this one I understood a lot
better.

The sweet-hearted tale of a family of Russian mouse emigrants who travel to
America, the 'land of opportunity' but on their way lose their son, really
manages to perk up your day. It has all the classic elements of a family
flick: great characters, wonderful score and songs, and of course a happy
ending (You can't say you didn't expect that).

In some ways it's meant to be almost a satire, a parallel story of many
Russian immigrant families who flee to America from the Cossacks: there is
actually a scene in the beginning involving the ransacking of a Russian
village by Cossacks, aided of course, as most history books conveniently
omit, by their vicious slavering cats who destroy the mouse population. This
satire is slightly lost once they reach America, but the simple plot of the
mouse boy trying to find his family again works very well. It's quite
frustrating at times as we see how close they all come to running into each
other; a split second here and a well-timed door slamming there, and it
could have been all over in thirty minutes of screen time. But where would
be the movie in that? 

Lastly, the voice cast does a great job. While I personally think the sequel
had a better cast, An American Tail boasts some fine names as well - Dom
DeLuise and Nehemiah Persoff who also did the sequel, Christopher Plummer,
and Madeline Kahn all combine for a great effect. It's not necessary to see
this to also see the sequel but it definitely deserves to be watched.
Touching, light-hearted and with one of the most beautiful theme songs you
will ever hear, it's a winner. ***1/2 / *****

**SPOILERS**

I saw AAT when i was young and recently watched it again. It was a
favorite then and I still got a kick out of it and will probably watch
it again. The animation and backgrounds work quite well, dim grimy
dull, which make the few moments when things shine (the fireworks, the
bottle floating, the waterfall and lighting when Fievel and the family
are reunited) all the more powerful, overall the color is great. 

Its good to see that IMDb is truly an International Database, and i
love that i can read reviews by people who've identified that they are
from such places as Pakistan, Jamaica, Argentina, and beyond. As an
American Jew myself, the connections to this film are quite obvious and
my more recent viewing really gave me a sense of the contribution
Steven Spielberg has made in my life, and many other lives about Jews /
Americans. I enjoy the opportunity to view other's readings of the
film, to see how the messages in the film are viewed by people outside
America.

The film has some obvious political undertones that a child will not
necessarily pick up. This is a pretty cool thing / kinda sesame street
like / a subtle education. While Fievel's family is Jewish, not all the
mice in the film are, as we meet other immigrant mice who are carrying
crosses, etc. What the mice have in common is immigrant status as well
as being under the oppression of "the Cats" (don't say it too loud). 

Who are the cats? Are the cats just the bullies in any given situation?
While the Russian cats that drove Fievel's family from their home in
Russia mirrored the Pogroms / Nazis / Jewish oppressors, Who were the
oppressors on the American soil? (is it a direct reflection to a group
of oppressors in American in the late 19th century?)

In light of current political situations this movie could have many
implications / readings. Does America still seem to have that silver
lining? Are people round the world still singing their own equivalents
to "The Are No Cats In America?" 

Contrast Fievel with Mickey "Mouse" himself, a wonderful comparison.
Fievel is almost a real person whereas Mickey is more cartoony. Fievel
is a child mouse. As children ourselves we can put ourselves in his
shoes more easily, (which is why this is a children's movie) his
fascination with "the fish," and always asking questions, his
curiosity, which gets him in trouble, and his ability to dream and
somehow stumble through it all still surviving (if not drunk and
woosie, green-ish) from it all. (a little detail i enjoy is how,
invariably he always winds up in some sort of "bubble" (the soap
bubble, the bottle, the bed in watertower, etc.. where ever he goes he
is protected in a bubble home, he is magically kept in this safety
bubble, the bubble of being the main character in a major motion
picture, of being the focus for millions of children.) ... another
trait of Fievel's is his amazing ability to run up a stream of falling
debris to which he uses quite often to escape sticky situations. 

The collective effort of the mice to build the Mouse of Minsk is
wonderful and the final product is huge and beautifully grotesque and
awesome. I love how it rolls out, bursting through the door of the
boarded up "museum of the weird." There is something in this, how the
solution to the cat problem lies in the pieces of this abandoned
museum. How all sorts of knicknacks, falderall, and whatnotknots could
be gumbo-ed together to create this Mouse of Minsk monster (an analogy
/ metaphor to the very real-life America itself.)

There are also some extremely funny moments in this film, like when
Tony Toponi, (Fievels friend and escapee from the sewing sweatshop)
first sees and falls head over heels in love with Bridget (our Irish
rabble rouser). She is all soapbox-ish and politics and talking about
getting rid of the cats, and Tony freezes stiff and falls off the
roof... (this falling off the roof i have watched, re-wound and watch
again about 10,000 times) i don't know why but it just cracks me up the
way his body remains stiff and sort of just slides / pops off the roof,
and then how he is trying to repeat "cats" when Bridget sees him and he
is the only mouse who has not yet run away, she is happy that they at
least have each other, and then these hippy flowers come out of nowhere
and it's like a sixties love-in all of a sudden.

Also the underground imagery in the sewer is quite accurate and really
beautiful. (accurate in the sense of feeling one gets when crawling
through a storm drain, which is the equivalent to the film, since it
was managing water) (A sewer manages human waste and waste water, while
the storm drain system manages excess Weather water...).... just
beautiful (yeah in that grimy sooty way)

Another fun moment is when Fievel thinks he hears his father playing
his violin, but it is only a gramophone, in which he climbs into, and
then when looking into the void gets sad again because he doesn't see
his father, then the lady changes the recording which is now this
SUDDEN LOUD American boisterous BIG BAND song POMPING great American
pride which causes Fievel to fall down into the void of the Phonography
and is spat out onto the music which speeds up and slows down (which is
of course how Hip-Hop (turntablism) was invented)-(which is also a
metaphor for the very real America, the "melting pot" or rather the
mixing, scratching, rapping pot.) ... a great little scene, which
exemplifies how the mice have to deal with the human environment as
well. The mice are real to the humans in the movie, (they see them as
real live mice, something to throw a shoe at) somehow us in the
audience are different, we are able to see the world at their level, to
be able to hear their story. 

Overall a fun classic movie which has some important messages about
collective power, what freedom is and means from an American
perspective. An Adventuresome "musical" with wonderful songs (and sad
songs.) A little piece of my childhood as a young American... "America,
what a place!" 8/10

<|_=00=_|>
As a kid I watched this film many times, as it had four key things that
it had (and still has) going for it: 1) a story that does not skim on
really putting peril for the characters (the separation sequence on the
ship is absorbing, but also devastating if you're heavily invested in
Fievel and his father); 2) good songs that aren't too preachy, and with
enough emotional tug to be Disney-like, but unusual or unexpected in
some of the styles of; 3) how the characters are animated- I love the
variety given to the different mice and cats and how the humans are
wisely left in the shadows or with just a hand or a foot; and 4) the
comedy in the film balances without a fault with the comedy. In terms
of subject matter, there is a lot of historical background information
that kids today may have no care for, but it doesn't matter; Fievel and
his family could be any immigrant mouse family, and really the core of
the story (the importance of family and love) is what carries it
through. And because of this balance between comedy and drama- there
are allusions to the Pogroms in Russia, the struggles of the immigrant
working life in 19th century America, and racism, but voices like
Madeline Kahn and Dom DeLouise are featured in key roles- it may throw
some in the audience off, or be too much on a first viewing. It may not
even be a 'great' film. Yet as expertly Don Bluth directed hand-drawn
animation, with a big heart and a bright, and dark, story of mice
versus cats, it has a wonderment about it that should be appealing
almost twenty years down the line. It's certainly better than the
sequel, which is all slapstick as opposed to being comic-tragic, which
also has an appeal for some older kids and adults.
