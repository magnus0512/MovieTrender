This movie has 2 stories that that run side by side, depicting the same
image of war from different perspectives.

Denzel's story is one of sadness and guilt over the death of a friend
during the Gulf war, a friend that he himself killed in a 'Friendly
Fire' incident, during the confusion of battle. His country won't let
him speak, and they shower him with medals; this only adds to the pain
that begins to tear him apart.

Denzel's Character is given an assignment to determine whether a female
helicopter pilot (Meg Ryan) deserves the medal of honour.

Meg's story, played out in flashbacks, is about a helicopter pilot and
her crew saving a handful of soldiers, from the Iraqi onslaught. She is
the first female to be considered for the medal of honour, and the
question is, does she deserve what the American people would so love
too see her receive.

Denzel, determined to get this one right, collects evidence and
testimony from Ryans crew and the men that were saved. The problem is,
Denzel's superiors want this medal awarded, but the simple truth is
difficult to unveil. Every shred of evidence leads to more and more
uncertainty as to whether this medal should be awarded.

Truly compelling direction and very special character portrayal make
this an extremely enjoyable, very dramatic movie.

If you've over looked it, then give it a try. I think you'll be glad
you did.

The story is a simple one. Washington is a Lt. Colonel responsible for
some accidental deaths during a tank battle in the Gulf War. The
experience leaves him feeling pretty lousy. He neglects his family and
begins drinking. He's assigned to investigate the suitability of Meg
Ryan as a posthumous recipient of the Medal of Honor. She was flying a
medevac helicopter to a crash site when her aircraft was shot down by
small arms fire and, apparently, she stayed behind voluntarily and
ordered her crew to save themselves while she covered them. Washington
interviews the crew members and gets different stories. In one story
Ryan behaves heroically as described. In a second, she is a coward and
collapses under fire. In yet a third, the truth emerges. Yeah, it's
Rashomon, but not as original or subtle.

Still it's pretty good. And, Gott sei dank, it is not a story in which
a woman proves herself as a good as a man, despite the fact that she is
a member of the weaker sex. (What condescension.) Meg Ryan is a capable
and courageous officer who happens to be a woman. Her sex is important
to the politicians who are positively drooling over the prospect of
awarding her the decoration, but isn't really important to the
narrative.

The performances are better than I'd expected. Everyone, in fact, is
quite good in their different ways. Matt Damon, in particular, gives a
sensitive performance as a guilt-ridden medic, and looks the part,
somewhat ascetic, his facial features askew with uncertainty. Meg Ryan
doesn't have a chance to do more than shout orders with a Texas accent
but she registers pain and determination well. Lou Diamond Phillips is
perhaps the least articulated character, but that may be the fault of
the role as written, which is fairly complex but a little obvious.
Denzel Washington is the central figure. He's good as carrying that
burden of guilt left over from his battlefield mistake but isn't too
convincing as a drunk. In the end, he relieves himself of some of that
torture by visiting the parents of one of the men he had killed and
confessing his part in the incident. The first few times I saw this I
kept thinking what some other actors would have done with this scene,
but the last time I found his incarnate remorse rather moving.

There is one scene delicately shot, an uneasy exchange between the
lying Damon and the perceptive Washington that's beautifully staged and
acted, and another memorable first encounter between Washington and
Phillips, in which both actors probe the edges of insubordination.
Michael Dolan stands out in a featured bit part as a hospital orderly.

The battle scenes are well done, although a little confusing, as I'm
sure they would have been at the time. Some generic conventions are
adhered to. Four of our guys can slaughter dozens of them. The enemy
runs headlong into a hail of bullets. But there are some interesting
twists given to the situation. The Iraqis on the other side of the hill
can be heard laughing at our boys (and our woman). And the ending is
revisionist, but I won't go into it. Justice outs, let's say that.

It's a worthwhile watch for any number of reasons. Craftsmanlike if not
poetic.

Edward Zwick's second war-based movie (following the successful GLORY)
is almost as good as his first, and every bit as watchable. I have
particularly liked stories that use different viewpoints to tell the
same story (hence creating different versions of the same story). These
types of movies stemmed no doubt from Akira Kurosawa's epic RASHOMON,
and while films that use this strategy rarely live up to Kurosawa's
original in terms of intelligence and portrayal (the most recent being
the slightly-better-than-mediocre VANTAGE POINT), COURAGE UNDER FIRE is
still a rewarding Motion Picture.

Denzel Washington is near his brilliant best as the troubled Lieutenant
Colonel on the verge of alcoholism due in part to his overwhelming
feelings of guilt following a military procedure gone wrong. His
depression and curiosity fuel his determination to get to the bottom of
the 'mystery' even if it puts him out of favour with his Commanding
Officers. Meg Ryan is equally superb, and as each re-telling of the
story demands her to take on a different personality (similar to the
female lead in RASHOMON), she manages to pull each one off effectively.
Matt Damon puts in a reliable shift, even losing upward of 20 pounds to
take on the role. For me, the biggest surprise is Lou Diamond Phillips
who is actually quite watchable, and does not overact, as is his
tendency.

Zwick's COURAGE UNDER FIRE is an examination of war from a less
visceral point of view, and will stay with the viewer long after
watching the movie. It deeply delves into themes of responsibility,
guilt, and truth in an overall compelling Motion Picture. The script is
effective and the buildup to the somewhat sentimental ending is quite
commendable.

8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Highly recommended. Should enter my Top 200
at around #183.

A DESERT STORM veteran, Lt Col Nat Serling (played by Denzel
Washington), is assigned the task of recommending whether or not to
award the first (posthumous) combat Medal of Honor to a woman, Capt
Karen Walden (played by Meg Ryan). In investigating the inconsistent
mission accounts of Walden's surviving crew, Serling constantly flashes
back to his own searing DESERT STORM experience and the Army's
subsequent attempts to whitewash the incident, resolving that his
investigation will not suffer the same fate. As Serling tries to
rectify the competing competing accounts it becomes clear that director
Edward Zwick has crafted a contemporary "Rashomon," complete with
reminders that the truth is always subjective and our accounts of it
typically affected by self-interest.

"Courage Under Fire" is perhaps the best illustration of how flexible and
adaptive actors like Denzel Washington are.  What makes "Courage Under Fire"
impressive is not so much its plot or storyline (which is somewhat
inconsistent), but its portrayal of a lone officer torn between personal
conscience and duty.  Denzel's overweight build and alcoholic demeanor
create the highly credible image of a man barely attached to his life. 
Basically the story of a budding Army officer re-assigned to administrative
duties following a Desert Storm friendly fire incident, "Courage Under Fire"
submerges the viewer into pure emotional hell as it progresses.  The
stunning emotional catharisis portrayed at the film's end is incredibly
dramatic and almost entirely unmatched.  Anyone who has ever been under the
extreme pressures of stress or suffered cognitive dissonance following a bad
judgement will definitely connect with this film.  A great psychological
thriller and a tour-de-force drama.  Definitely one of the best films...if
only it would be released on DVD!!

America's sweetheart as a helicopter pilot? Most critics say she does an
excellent job, but that's not what makes this movie so momentous. Neither is
it the excellent performance by Denzel Washington, who had been expected by
many to win an Oscar nomination for it. Nor is it the over the top
performance of Matt Damon, nor is it the excellent contributions by any of
the others in the cast. It's the way the story is told: throughout the movie
you see the same sequence, over and over again, and each time you understand
what is happening just a little bit more, until at the very end the import
of it all hits you like a locomotive. It's a unique brand of story telling,
and eminently successful.

Courage Under Fire is a movie that will stay with me for a while. Denzel
Washington continues to be one of the finest actors today and proves it in
this movie. The premise was interesting and was entertaining. I was
disappointed with Meg Ryan's performance. I usually like her but she got
annoying with her constant shouting. Yet that didn't keep the movie down. It
was extremely dramatic and my two favorite scenes are the scene with Lou
Diamond Phillips in the car and when it shows what really happened. A great
film and terrific acting by Denzel Washington.

I don't care about the petty "goofs" or parts of the story that other
people point out- this movie means a lot to me as a disabled veteran
with PTSD. This movie is about many things, but to me, the story is
about how Col Sterling is trying to manage his survivor guilt and PTSD
from his incident on one hand, and deal with his task to validate the
medal for his General, his wife, his kids, etc. on the other. He
resorts to booze (like we all do) to try to cope. That's what this
movie is really about: how one guy is trying to come to grips with
PTSD, which I can tell you first-hand is a challenge that I face every
minute of everyday. And seeing this movie helps heal me. It reminds me
that I too lost a promising career in the Navy, lost my marriage, lost
my kids, and lost myself in the abyss of PTSD and alcoholism before I
got help. That's the only negative I have on this movie- we don't see
if Col Sterling got help. Otherwise, this movie has helped heal me in
ways that no other movie I've ever seen has.

Whoa!  Some of these reviewers bring so much of gender politics and national
politics to their reviews, the movie itself is lost.  I wasn't going to add
a comment until I found the one that said, "We didn't know what this movie
was about, so it's a bad movie; by the way, we wore earplugs all through
it."

Come on, folks, get the cotton out and listen up.  Matt Damon's ability and
willingness to lose forty or fifty pounds in the course of his role is
certainly above and beyond the usual call of duty for a supporting actor. 
His expert embodiment of the fragility and shame of his character
foreshadowed his leading-man career to come.  Denzel Washington and Lou
Diamond Phillips merit the kind words other reviewers have left here, and
certainly Meg Ryan deserves none of the harsh ones.

Her performance was perfect, whether portraying the gutsy leader recalled by
some narrators or the over-estrogened mess detailed by her bitter gunner. 
Someone here complained she was "too pretty" -- please!  Pretty happens,
even in the military.  Others here complained her voice was too high, no,
too low, no... perhaps it's their expectations of female soldiers that are
too high, too low, too wedded to or too opposed to gender
stereotypes.

One of the European reviewers here complained that this film was too
pro-American and dehumanized the Iraqis.  I thought the director was showing
that it is a universal tactic to assure yourself of your righteousness by
dehumanizing and misrepresenting "the enemy," whether it is the opposing
force or a captain you despise for her power over you.  Remember, the film
begins with a scene showing that the forces are so similar that they are
literally indistinguishable -- though that point may not have been
intentional on the director's part.  Certainly the point is lost as the film
goes on to lionize every American life lost while placing only target value
on the deaths of opposing soldiers.

This was a war movie that acknowledged cowardice as well as courage, shame
as well as gallantry, deadly mistakes as well as brilliant tactics, all in
the same arena and sometimes all in the same individual.  One movie can only
carry so much freight, and perhaps asking every war movie to highlight the
pointlessness of war and the excesses of nationalism is asking too
much.

Aside from all that, the filmography and special effects were astonishing,
both in the war shots (the napalm drop, the tank lines, the helicopters in
the cliffs) and in the most dramatic domestic death scene. 

This was an excellent movie, with stunning performances, great direction,
and a fine story line.  But if you're wearing earplugs or blinders, you're
going to miss it.

*****  Warning ****  Contains spoilers ****

Anyone interest in Desert Storm should see "Courage Under Fire." It is a
powerful story with great performances by the whole cast.  Denzel Washington
really deserved an Oscar for this role, so different than the other major
roles he's played such as Malcolm X.  What makes the story so compelling is
that you see that war is not just a string of heroics, but is fraught with
problems and mistakes as in any other occupation.  But in war, mistakes can
cost lives.  We see the loyalty and courage shown by our troops as well as
their human failures. 

Lt. Col. Serling (Washington), back at the Pentagon after commanding a tank
division in the Gulf War, is assigned to investigate whether Capt. Karen
Walden, a rescue helicopter pilot killed in action (Meg Ryan) deserves a
Congressional Medal of Honor.  Serling is deeply troubled by his mistake
which caused the death of an old friend.  When an unidentified tank appeared
in the formation, Serling had to make a split-second decision whether or not
to fire.  He does, and unfortunately it turns out to be one of ours.  His
depression affects his whole life, including his family, and he notices that
he is drinking too much.  His boss, General Hershberg, with whom he also
served in Vietnam, tries his best to help Serling get over
it.

As Serling interviews the soldiers who flew with Captain Walden, her story
is shown in a series of flashbacks.  We soon learn that there are major
inconsistencies in the stories he hears, some of which imply she was
incompetent.  Not content to do a superficial job, Serling digs deeper and
finds that Capt. Ryan did indeed show leadership and courage, but that her
death resulted from another accident caused by the insubordination of one of
the men (Lou Diamond Phillips), and covered up by the rest of the crew. 
Serling now knows that Walden deserves the medal.

**** Contains spoiler *****
In the end, Serling is vindicated when an audio tape of his tank company's
battles shows that his quick thinking led to the identification and
destruction of another unidentified tank which got into their formation. 
This time he brilliantly identified it as an Iraqi tank and fired, saving
the rest of his tanks from the enemy. 

This film shows that war is not glamorous, not all black and white, but
shades of gray.  This film has some of the best acting you will ever see --
the entire cast gave excellent performances.  Cast against typecast, Meg
Ryan came across as one tough soldier, a welcome change from all her "cute"
roles.  

**** Contains spoiler *****
The final scene in which Washington marches up to and salutes Ryan's grave
shows Serling's courage, loyalty, and sacrifice without a single word.  This
is definitely a film worth seeing.
