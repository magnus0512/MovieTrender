OK, this movie has a good cinematography and one cannot argue about the
good
craftsmanship.

However, who invented this ridiculous story???

Let me get this right:

a) Aliens can travel millions of light years in their space crafts, but
lack
the technology of breaking into a wooden house.
b) For that matter - a seven-foot-tall alien, who can run like an Olympic
athlete, can be locked into a wooden kitchen pantry without being able to
escape.
c) Aliens (able to travel space) run around naked and cannot deal with
water. Does this imply that a raincoat is a more sophisticated invention
than a spaceship?
d) Aliens come to `harvest human beings', but can be scared off by wooden
clubs. Aehhh . the human body consists 90+% of water, which the aliens
cannot handle . does this qualify for the `real dumb plot
award'???
e) A referent looses his faith when his wife dies (which is fair), but
regains it when he remembers her last words which tip him off that Aliens
doesn't like being beaten with wooden clubs . are there more people who
think this is crap???

Also:

f) When confronted with an imminent Alien attack, board yourself into a
lonely wooden house in the prairie - don't go into the next town, arm
yourself and join the local militia / military organisation.

g) Don't have the asthma medicine your son's life is depending on
handy.
h) After you boarded up your house, just hang around in the lounge. Don't
fortify your cellar basement and shift all your water, food and medicine
there.
i) Lacking fire arms, don't arm yourself with knifes, axes or whatever you
can find. Leave your vicious guard dogs (who detect aliens earlier than
you
and could scare them off) outside the house.

.. And the top price goes to:

j) Alien communication can best be observed on baby monitors!!! .
sophisticated civil air control and military radar equipment cannot spot
them.

Well, they don't make movies like that one any more. Hopefully, no-one
will
never ever make a movie like that one again!!!

My opinion - right down there with `Battlefield Earth' and `Giggli'. 1 out
of 10.

<|_=00=_|>
I don't think this film deserved the poor reviews that some gave it.
I've only seen 3 of Night Shylaman's films (6th Sense, Unbreakable) and
this one is the most sophisticated in my mind in terms of the director
manipulating the viewers into seeing and believing what he wants you to
believe.

This is not Gibson's worst film by any means. If anything he gets to
try to portray an understated, confused, and emotionally scarred
character and I think he soft-sells it very well. Joaquin Phoenix also
has a similar character to play and he too soft-sells it well. That was
probably not an accident as their calm, sullen personalities contrast
with the unbearable situation they find themselves in.

If you haven't already, see it - and keep an open mind.
<|_=00=_|>
As a long-time science fiction fan and as a scientist, I was not
prepared for the insult foisted upon this viewer by this miscarriage of
the legacy of true science fiction. If one wishes to have a movie about
faith and redemption, fine, but don't trash a whole genre in the
process with unbelievable sloppiness. Three years after seeing the
film, I still feel insulted.

Spoilers: Why would an intelligent life form capable of traversing
untold distances and for whom contact with water is fatal choose a
planet for invasion whose surface is predominantly water? Why would
that intelligent life form be incapable of sufficient intelligence and
tools to free itself from an ordinary locked room? Why would those
beings choose to prey on beings that are primarily composed of that
substance they find fatal? The list goes on and on, but the bottom line
is that some director with no feel and, obviously, no respect for the
genre choose that genre for his vehicle? Oh, yeah, name stars and $$$. 

Next time I see the name M. Night Shyamalan, I'll forego the
experience.
<|_=00=_|>
Advanced beings who have mastered Space Travel but have a deadly
aversion to water choose to invade a planet where every breath you take
is full of moisture, the atmosphere is full of moisture so guess the
outcome. Also, even with there advanced knowledge they seem to have a
problem breaking down wooden barriers. And was it only me but didn't
that maize field scene look remarkably like the scene from E.T. But
hang on this film isn't about Alien Invasion at all I hear you shout,
its about man questioning and rediscovering his faith. Well, he may
have done that but i lost my faith in the American Film Industry in the
process. This is a film that insults the audience's intelligence.
<|_=00=_|>
I saw this film at a packed opening weekend showing in NYC. As the film
progressed and the tension rose I thought to myself that this was
actually a pretty good film. There were scares, some laughs and even
some scenes that tugged at the old heart strings. It reminded me of
Night of the Living Dead and the original War of the Worlds, both of
which are long time favorites. Durring the final, climactic scene
something so completely retarded occurred that I was ripped out of the
contented haze the movie had lulled me into. I was shocked. I turned to
my girlfriend and said "They get killed by water? Water kills them?"
She said, loudly "This movie is F*CKING DUMB!" And I said "I don't
believe it..." And that's it. Naked aliens who find water to be deadly
come to the wettest place in this solar system. Then, believe it or
not, they get killed with water. Other posters (nearly 1,000 or
something) have pointed out how utterly insulting this is so I won't go
any further into it. I would like to know why the people who rate this
a 10 don't bother addressing this outlandish plot device that destroys
the entire film for so many others. I would even accept an explanation
like "I am an idiot and MAJOR plot-holes don't bother me at all". Has
M. Night ever defended this ludicrous flick? No? That's probably
because it's indefensible.
<|_=00=_|>
This film could have been so, so much better. Its greatest weak points
are 1) the overly religious theme and the complete pap that links
coincidence, fate and religious faith, and 2) completely stupid and
illogical storyline regarding the Aliens attack of the earth.

The cinematography is good, but nothing special. Mel Gibson's acting is
laboured. Joaquin Phoenix is better, and has real talent, but is wasted
in this. The dialogue is cringe-worthy in many over the top sentimental
scenes between Gibson and his kids.

The best thing about this movie is the genuine build up of tension for
the 1st hour or so. Like some of the best monster/alien movies, the
creature(s) are only revealed a tiny bit at a time  and old (but good)
tricks are used to keep the suspense high. Up until this point I was
quite enjoying the film, and it 'had me going' a little.

The finishing 30 mins does not do any justice to the build up, and the
plot at the end is just silly and lame. I don't really know where to
begin .. Well, OK, for starters, it seems absolutely ridiculous to me
that an extremely advanced race of Aliens (as they must be to build
space craft that can travel great distances in space and that can also
be rendered invisible to our eyes when they get here) have to

i) create crop circles to navigate the earth ii) cannot work out ways
to smash down wooden doors and battened windows of a house.

You would think that had they come millions of miles to 'harvest
(????)' humans they would have come prepared with some sort of hi tech
guns that paralyse us, or at the very least some suits that make
themselves invisible (like their ships) or maybe carry some hi-tech
equipment to aid them in their task. But oh no, they wander around our
planet surface butt naked thereby enabling us to lock them in wooden
pantries! Perhaps if we were told that the Aliens are giving us a
sporting chance (a la the Predator alien that hunts Arnie) then we
might be willing to suspend disbelief regarding their apparent
incompetence in 'harvesting' an inherently inferior race (i.e. us) a
little more, but we are not led to believe that they are doing any such
thing. 

You would also think, that such an advanced race of Aliens would
probably work out a way to feed themselves without having to travel
round the galaxy looking for beings to 'harvest', assuming that they
are 'harvesting' us for food (we are not really told). And if it's meat
they want, you'd think they get better value harvesting cows, sheep and
pigs, no? In fact, if they'd just have asked us, 'hey we need some
food', I'm sure planet earth's leaders would have given them a good
supply of meat. But no, they attack us and risk themselves in the
process!

Also why, if water is like acid to them, are they wandering around butt
naked on a planet that has most of its surface covered in water and
whose atmosphere is full of water droplets and vapour??!!? Are we
supposed to believe that bulk quantities of water 'melt' the aliens,
but they can quite happily breathe our air complete with the high
levels of water vapour that is in it?!? And if they don't breathe (we
are never really told much about the aliens) then still the high levels
of water vapour in our air would surely be a bit of a problem to them,
no?

There are just so many stupid inconsistencies in this film, it is
almost quite laughable. And it is a shame really, because (as I said
initially) the film is genuinely scary and suspenseful in the 1st hour.
It's just that when the final credits roll, you think, 'hang-on a
minute, that ending was just complete nonsense!!!'

For all the hype M. Night Shyamalan is getting for writing, producing
and directing his films, he really should learn a bit of science before
trying to write a plot involving science fiction

*** Possible Spoilers Ahead ***

I was originally sad to have missed this movie in the theatres, because I
had heard good things about it. So it was with anticipation that I rented
the DVD and settled back for a good evening's viewing...
...Ooops!

I always start by trying to say something nice about a film, because almost
no movie is universally bad. Well, "Signs" is extremely well-shot, with
production design and camera work combining seamlessly to evoke a sense of
atmosphere and growing panic - hats off to Tak Fujimoto. The casting and
acting are good too - Mel does a classically Gibson good job of creating the
role of the self-doubting agonised ex-Father father, Joaquin Phoenix
provides a good foil as his ingenuous brother, and both child actors are
convincing and endearing, their performances realistic enough to engage your
sympathies.

Sadly, that's as far as it goes. I started to worry as soon as I saw that M
Night Shyamalan, not satisfied with writing *and* directing the movie, had
decided to shove himself in front of the camera too, in his role as the
hapless killer of Mrs. Mel. Bad move, M Night. You're no actor, but worse
still in one stroke you evaporated my suspension of disbelief - I'm
instantly asking myself "Good grief - it's the director! why the Heck does
he feel the need to be on screen?" This totally smacked of self-indulgence
and a nasty little suspicion of self-publicising arrogance. It's almost as
if, after just three movies, M Night has decided that he deserves a 
Hitchcock-esque cameo performance in his forthcoming movies as some sort of
signature - except he picks out a role for himself that is way larger than
incidental.

And destroying the suspension of disbelief is what this movie achieves
effortlessly as the action progresses. Forget the obvious borrowings from at
numerous other mainline sci-fi sources - M Night would probably call these
deliberate "hommages", and frankly it helps pass the time to pick these out.
You'll find Night Of The Living Dead, Independence Day, Day Of The Triffids,
War Of The Worlds at the very least and there's more. 

This however is not the problem. It's the gaping plot holes, the sheer
stupidity of the actions of both people and aliens in the context that's
been created for them. To highlight just a couple out of countless - aliens
capable of interstellar travel being unable to get past a flimsy wooden
door? Those same ultra-genius aliens not realising that perhaps bringing an
umbrella along with a crowbar might be a good idea?? Mel deciding not to
bother calling the authorities to alert them there's a trapped alien in his
neighbour's pantry, and for him to just go on home instead??? I couldn't
avoid hearing leaden clang after clang as these incongruities kept smacking
me between the eyes.

I also scowl at the massively misrepresented marketing of "Signs" - it
simply cannot be a movie about alien invasion, because it's so threadbare of
plot, so it *must* therefore be a contrived vehicle about one man's loss and
subsequent regaining of his faith, although the massively laboured and
contrived series of coincidences in the movie - the fortuitously half-full
water glasses left around, the precognitive message from the dying wife, the
well-timed asthma attack - would be enough to turn the most rabid atheist
back to God. Who needs faith in those circumstances, because blatant proof
is being rubbed in your face.

In summary, my central criticism of "Signs" remains the way in which we the
audience are implicitly patronised as being stupid. You can almost hear the
thought process -  "Give the poor fools enough style and atmosphere and
they'll not even notice the fact that there's no sense in the plot."  Don't
believe your own hype, M Night. Sure, "Sixth Sense" was a good movie, though
less original and far less "shockingly twisted at the end" than the media
would have had us believe, but "Unbreakable" was no more than poor to
average. "Signs" has its good points, but never presume you can get your
audience to swallow everything. Yes, we like style and love atmosphere, but
sorry, if you're going to set up a narrative context - and remember you
wrote the story too - then we need even vaguely convincing plot too. Sorry,
but we as viewers deserve better than this.

Four out of Ten - and that's for cinematography.


<|_=00=_|>

This movie was the most illogical and predictable piece of crap I've seen
in
years. I loved Unbreakable and Sixth Sense, but this film feels like M
Night
Shyamalan's attempt to see how ridiculously absurd he can make a movie
while
still getting it made. He did a good job too. I can't really explain
what's
so bad about it without spoiling it, so:

***********SPOILERS***********

- Nothing makes any sense. Water-allergic aliens landing on Earth without
protective suits? Don't give me that "alien logic" stuff. It's just
dumb.

- The divine message from God is "take the big bloody piece of wood and
whack the alien over the head". Yeah, he'd never have thought of that
himself. It takes divine wisdom to think of clobbering an intruder with a
baseball bat.

- A Middle Eastern village finds out how to defeat the aliens (water, how
original!) and from there it spreads throughout the world. How? We're
conveniently not told, but it managed to elude the reporter with 30 cell
phones and 50 fax machines. Every Pakistani peasant got the message, but
CNN
missed it. Yeah. Sounds likely.

- Did anyone believe Mel Gibson wouldn't get his faith back at the end?
Even for a second?

Waste of time, money, and celluloid.
<|_=00=_|>

I have been a horror film fan for 30 years.  While I remember a few films
actually scaring me as a kid (Jaws, Psycho), I have failed to encounter many in my adult life.  I like to be scared, but Hollywood has seen fit to retread every tired formulaic convention in just about everything it throws at the local multiplex.
Even the independent filmmakers, free of the "system", seem to forget what
FEAR is. Mostly I sit solemnly staring in disbelief at the screen, waiting
and hoping to get those goosebumps. Then, finally, we were given Signs. Most
will say, including the director, that this is not a horror film;  I genuinely
disagree.  If this is not a horror flick, then it is time for this film to start a branch of its own and begin a new genre.  I admired every little aspect of this picture, from the use of everyday objects: baby monitor, a blank television screen and a half empty glass of water, to convey and act as a vehicle to extract fear from the ordinary.
Most of all, Shyamalan is an expert craftsman and knows how to get the
most out of space, actors and sound. It is the lingering shot on a basement
staircase when you are desperately hoping he moves his camera to show us more, or the screeching sound in the next room  whose source he won't reveal .  This
director knows just how long to hold the shot, to increase the tension and build the suspense, long enough for our mind to begin forming pictures.  And those pictures can be the most frightening of all.  Stay the course
Shyamalan.

<|_=00=_|>

M. Night Shyamalan has done it again, and this time, better.   If
'Unbreakable' left skepticism about the young director, `Signs' will make
you a believer again.

Mel Gibson and his family, one boy, one girl, and Gibson's younger brother
(Joaquin Phoenix) take residence in the small town of Bucks County,
Pennsylvania.  Gibson's wife is not a member of this household (we find
out
why, later).  Shot over and around a 'Walton's-style' house and surrounded
by crops, we get the eerie feeling that we are to be entangled here for
the
next two hours.  Immediately, the children notice gigantic perfect
circular
shapes or signs as we like to call them, appearing within the crops.  Is
this a hoax or War of the Worlds?  And, that's all you need to know.  The
rest of film will dazzle you with style, suspense, and downright
scariness.

The key ingredients to this recipe for storytelling is one half Close
Encounters of the Third Kind, a dash of Stephen King, sprinkled with Orson
Wells.  Shyamalan also uses Hitchcock like close ups, wicked camera
angles,
and a blasting score.  You are locked in as soon as the movie begins.  You
will tilt your head in wonder and confusion, as characters in the film do.
There is a deep desire to figure this all out, while your stuck in the
middle of nowhere, nowhere being Bucks County.

The picture gives us two ultimate dilemmas to wrestle with.  Two basic
questions we must ask ourselves.  Are our daily occurrences and the paths
we
choose Coincidence?  Or, are is it just plain Luck?
Shyamalan weaves these posing questions into a subplot, with
trickery until the end.  From scene to scene, he leaves no fades to black.
As one scene ends the other smartly begins.  That's what keeps the
audience
watching as if we were tucked tightly into our beds and rapidly turning
pages of a good book.  Each page is significant.  This movie isn't just
about crops.  That's what makes Shyamalan such a keen filmmaker.  He has
the
talent and ability to fog up the film, and distract you with different
propositions.

Shyamalan uses technique to peak his story, rather than dialogue.  His
masterful and favorite formula is the usage of flashbacks, which gives the
audience a chance to catch up on what they might have missed.  He
emphasizes
his points by re-occurring scenes and replaying them for the grand effect,
the 11th hour, until he hits you with the finale.  Whether you believe the
outcome or not, you cannot deny his aptitude for storytelling.

This nervous and paranoid feature film with a heart-pounding ending is
terrific.  I was still thinking about it when I left the theater.  You
too,
will enjoy the ride.  But, when it's over, say your prayers, get into bed,
pull the sheets over your head, breathe a sigh of relief, and close the
book!
