Once Upon A Time In Mexico is good, but not as strong as Desperado. Our
hero, El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) barely has any lines. Throughout
the movie we forget this talented actor is the star of the movie. The
explosive action is incredible, and including Sands (Johnny Depp) is
the only thing worth raving about. Depp's role is actually the best
part of this movie. Salma Hayek's role has been chopped to flashbacks,
so there is not a lot of crazy Action and Romance between Banderas and
her. You want Antonio Banderas to save the day and he does, but this
Sequel did not give him that fire. Eva Mendes is in about 4 scenes but
does a great job including the rest of the cast (Ruben Blades, Cheech
Marin, Mickey Rourke, Willem Dafoe, and Enrique Iglesias). It would
have been nice to hear some hot new songs from Enrique Iglesias for the
soundtrack but I am more than satisfied with Salma Hayek's "Siente Mi
Amor". It is an incredible Spanish track, worth watching the entire
credits!
<|_=00=_|>
My Overall view after watching this moving was 2 things : One : The
Perfect "Femme Fatale" in Eva Mendes.

Two : Antonio Banderas played his role well but the overall movie was,
worth a 6.0 or 5.8 points rating.

As for Miss. Mendes i recommend a second part of the film "Cat Women",
I'd like Halle Berry Or Jessica Alba to play the "Top-Role" in the
Movie.

With Mendes as her Enemy and with Ex-Odyssey 5 Star Leslie Silva Or
Rosario Dawson as Sidekick to the "Evil" Miss Mendes.

But that for later i was just impressed by her well let's say
"Striking" Way to Outfox Johnny Depp.

Although in the end she got what she deserved, she impressed me.

Depp himself played a very good role, setting every body against
themselves and running the show, but like i said Mendes outfoxed him.

As for The Hole Movie, The Role Antonio Banderas played was good, he
took revenge for the death of his Wife (Salma Hayek).

Enrique Iglesias, did OK but i'm not sure whether he should be an
actor.

Here's my take on the movie :

The evil Barillo and General Marquez try to take over Mexico, and are
helped by the military. Barillo's tactical brilliance made his daughter
(Eva Mendes) enter the army, and threw that she could help him, control
the army, Mendes ho is using Johnny Depp to get her classified
information finds out that he is trying to use her for a scam that will
bring Depp a few million dollars! Mendes capture's him and because of
Depp saw that Barillo (Ho everybody thought was dead)was alive, Depp's
eyes were taken out, Depp seems no treat anymore.. but we all know how
that finished!(The Ones ho watched the movie)

Agent Jorge FBI, goes undercover to try and get the truth behind what's
going on in the "MOB-Bussiness", he teams up with ex-Mafia Mickey
Rourke, ho is wanted in the US, Jorge know's that and uses Rourke's
desire to get back the US, to find out more about Barillo and General
Marquez's plans, he asks for Rourke's help because Barillo killed
Jorge's best friend and Rourke agrees. In the end Jorge get's to deep
and finds Barillo's body on a plastic surgery table completely covered
with blood! Jorge tries to get out of the Hospital as soon as he can,
but is stunned when he sees Barillo in front of him "Alive" in the
steps. Agent Jorge then gets Knocked out by Barillo's daughter : Eva
Mendes.

As the popularity of "El Presidente" seems to be dropping his "adviser"
advises him to stay as much as he can in the presidential palace
leaving the president thinking that the people of Mexico are trying to
kill him!

The President questions the loyalty of his people, but in the end finds
out that they are the only ones he can trust!

In the end Antonio Banderas shot General Marquez for brutally killing
his wife (Salma Hayek) ho was pregnant, Hayek had a relationship with
Marquez but then shot him in the head, Marquez didn't die and swore
revenge. Helped by Enrique Iglesias, Banderas gets his revenge on
Marquez.

Agent Jorge gets a showdown with Barillo, the man ho shot Jorge's best
Friend and takes revenge.

In the end it seems like a movie about the "Mexican Liberation" with
the main thing the plotting of a "Coe d'etat".

But overall i wasn't overly impressed as i have seen movie's about,
Mexican Leberations before!

...not because it is a piece of cinematography at it's best but simply
because you will need to see it two or three times to actually
understand the basic plot of the movie (even though I enjoyed watching
it immensely).

The main thing that will draw people to watch this movie will be the
fact that it has Johnny Depp, Antonio Banderas, Willem Dafoe, Salma
Hayek, Eva Mendes, Enrique Iglesias...and many more famous names in it.
Although I must admit that some of them should have been given bigger
parts or else have been left out altogether.

I did enjoy watching this movie but it doesn't make sense the first
time around...there is so much going on that the audience often feels
as if trying to figure everything out will cause their brains to
overheat. up are still a definite factor, however, As Johnny Depp lends
his style and talents to the character of corrupt C.I.A agent, Sheldon
Jeffrey Sands(he even came up with the 'sheldon Jeffrey' part of the
name) even though the part was originally written for Quentin
Tarantino. And praise is much deserved of Enrique Iglesias who plays
the opinionated but still very loyal Lorenzoand also Eva Mendes who
plays Agent Ajedrez with edge and darkness.

This film is very much one for people who are fans of explosions and
action but not for those who like well-written plots. I did enjoy this
movie and I think Robert Rodriguez has impeccable style even if he
doesn't present it well in some instances.

It's got it's flaws, but the good out way the bad and there is no ugly
when it comes to this action adventure comedy blast! The action is
gritty, the action is spellbinding and the music, well it IS apart of
the Mariachi series so, take a wild guess. Antonio Banderas - as great
as he is in this flick he takes shotgun to Johnny Depp's lead. Depp as
Sands seems like perfect casting and it's a thrill to see a great actor
at the top his game. Selma Hayek - sadly - is not in this one as much
and it is a sham, but since she was doing Frida we forgive her, and it
actually makes for a more compelling and deeper action movie. El is
trapped between a rock in a hard place when it comes to saving his
people and saving his own neck. Has Robert Rodriguez puts it "It
becomes a battle of The Man with No Eyes, The Man with No Face and The
Man with a Guitar Case" and it's just that. Willim Dafoe gives a great
and chilling performance, Ruben Blades is in top form and Eva Mendes is
cold but hot none the less. And all fans of this series are happy to
see The Boy in The Yellow Shirt has made his return.

Like "Desperado," the film offers nonstop action and a gargantuan body
count.  Robert Rodriguez knows how to please his audience, and the movie
does work for the most part.  As expected in a Rodriguez film, the action
scenes are very well-choreographed and all possess a certain slickness and
originality.  Johnny Depp steals the show in his supporting role, and seems
to be having the most fun.  I actually looked at him as more of an action
hero than Antonio Banderas.  Then again, Banderas seems to be going through
the motions.  After all, he has played roles of this type many times before
and is probably almost bored.  I like how most of the movie is in subtitles.
 As I heard in the commentary, the reason for that was because most of the
cast only spoke Spanish.  But I'd rather see Mexican characters speaking in
their native language, and having to read the subtitles, than them speaking
in a second language that they obviously haven't mastered totally. 
Hollywood appears to have a fear of subtitles, and it's a stupid fear.  Now
onto what I didn't like about the movie...I'm not exaggerating when I say
that it has nonstop violence.  I'm not one of these people who gets bothered
by excessive violence, but after a while all that action and killing can get
a little dull.  You just sit there waiting for the next body to fall to the
ground.  The story isn't non-existent, but I think if Rodriguez paid a
little more attention to developing characters and story, his films might be
even more interesting.  But altogether, I was entertained.  You don't view a
film like this in the same way you view a Kubrick film.  So what you see is
what you get.  

My score:  7 (out of 10)  
<|_=00=_|>

ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO (2003) ***  Antonio Banderas, Johnny Depp, Salma
Hayek, Mickey Rourke, Ruben Blades, Eva Mendes, Willem Dafoe,  Cheech Marin,
 Danny Trejo, Enrique Iglesias, Marco Leonardi, Gerardo Vigil, Pedro
Armendariz Jr., Julio Oscar Mechoso, Tito Larriva.  Wunderkind Robert
Rodriguez' grand finale - Sergio Leone-style - of his South of the Border
trilogy of El Mariachi, the lone assassin for hire cum renegade (Banderas
once again) who is out for revenge (natch) for the murder of his beloved
(the achingly gorgeous Hayek in flashbacks) while being hired' by
gonzo-crazed CIA man Depp (in Walken mode) involving a corrupt federale (the
heavenly femme fatale Mendes), a retired FBI agent (Blades) and a nasty
presidente-wanna-be madman (Dafoe in heavy bronzer) resulting in a digital
bloodbath with flying corpses, gravity defying stunts (and women to boot!)
and much tongue-thru-cheek take-no-prisoners guerilla filmmaking Rodriguez
has made a trademark for (writing, chopping' and directing) with more of
the same to the nth degree.  Bloody good carnage and suspension of disbelief
should be checked at the door.  And for the record: that is Rourke's own
Chihuahua.

STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal
Instead*Avoid At All Costs

A follow up to the Desperado film was not something I was expecting.So it
came as a shock to see this third instalment in the El Mariachi series being
made.But a pleasant surprise it is.It is high on sweltering Mexican
style,with impressive camera style and angles.There is a complex and
engaging story to follow,complimented by some riveting action scenes and
classy dialogue.On the performances front,Antonio Banderas continues to
personify Mariachi,with Salma Hayek well cast as his love interest and good
support from Johnny Depp,Mickey Rourke and William Dafoe,not to mention the
bodacious Eva Mendes.A wholly worthwhile venture.***

I had looked forward to seeing this film for some time, given the stellar
cast. What I got was a plotless, ridiculous movie filled with ugly,
sickeningly rendered comic book violence. Johnny Depp in particular is
thoroughly wasted in his role, but not much more so than Antonio Banderas
and Willem Dafoe. Flashbacks, dreams,internal fantasies,imaginings, and some
of the most ludicrous firefights in movie history are interspersed here with
only the barest attempt at narrative. Near the end, when Johnny Depp's
character has been blinded but is still functional and seemingly hardly the
worse for wear, the movie descends into something close to idiocy. A
complete waste of time, money, and talent. I now understand why there were
only about 10 people in the 200 seat theater in which I saw the movie. The
word of mouth on this dreck must be horrendous.
<|_=00=_|>
This is the biggest piece of garbage I've seen in a very long time.
Idiotic, nonsensical, inconsistent plot; horrible dialogue; terrible
acting; scenes that are comical when they are obviously supposed to be
serious, and vice versa. Where do something like 50 motorcycles appear
out of nowhere in a crowded but otherwise peaceful plaza? How does
Antonio Banderas jump backwards from a 25-foot church loft and land
softly on his feet facing the opposite way? Why do supposedly dangerous
criminals stand motionless with weapons idly in hand while Banderas
beats them silly in slow motion? Why would a retired FBI agent suddenly
"activate" himself, then walk around in the street muttering to himself
as if he were wearing a wire? If you have any respect at all for the
laws of physics -- or good acting, or even mediocre film-making -- this
film will offend you.

I've seen some real stinkers in my time, but with this kind of star
power, you expect a whole lot better. I can understand why actor
wannabes like Banderas, Mickey Rourke, and Enrique Iglesias (!!!) are
in this pile of dung, but what on sweet Earth are accomplished actors
like Willem Dafoe, Johnny Depp, and Ruben Blades doing here? They must
have been sampling the goods of the ominous "Cartels" mentioned
repeatedly with no apparent reason. There is not one shred of artistry
in this loser, and it doesn't surprise me to read that Tarantino had a
hand in it somewhere. Don't waste your time.
<|_=00=_|>

I am a fan of Robert Rodriguez's previous offerings of El Mariachi and the
wonderful Desperado. Here he once more returns to the same character as
portrayed in the two earlier outings but this time seems to miss the mark
by
a country mile. Although the first two movies were simple 'revenge' films
which served to give the shoot-outs their purpose; this movie tries to
embellish this idea with a few sub-plots which frankly just don't work. I
was bored throughout and even though he returns with his trademark
comic-book violence, this time round it just seemed to be one big
yawn-fest.

I had no interest in any of the characters, I am madly in love with Salma
Hayek but frankly here I could care less about her character. Banderas
does
fill the screen when on but sadly, it just isn't enough to lift this movie
above more than mere average.

Sorry Robert, if a bigger budget means we have to suffer this, then please
go back to the low budget movies that made your name, in those you were
brilliant; here, merely less than average.
