Worst movie of the year?  Ok...the name is SLACKERS!  Not Schindlers List
Part 2.  Why do you people try to pull so much meaning out of these
stoner
flicks?  What are you thinking when you rent these movies?  That you'll
find
a diamond in the rough?  A Spielbergian classic?!?  I like stupid humor.
Sue me.  I can laugh dumb nonsense.  I've shown this to a ton of people
and
they all found humor in it.  Cool Ethan is quite possibly the craziest
character ever written and what his face from Rushmore pulls it off
perfectly.  Plus whats his face from that Stan video is PIMP in this
movie.
Seriously...take notes from STAN, eminems greatest fan.

My advice to you critics that downplay a stupid script in the first place
is
to stop watching comedy's.  Stop now while you're ahead.  Thank you and
good
day.

I'm actually a huge fan of all teen films, but I think this one was vastly
under-rated.  Some comments give the impression that
it is another gross-out teen romp with nothing new to offer.  In actual
fact
although it may be ranked alongside films such as American Pie Road Trip
etc, and though it shares common themes, it is actually a far superior
film.
As a result, people expect a film similar to the aforementioned, and are
faced instead with one which has slightly more to offer.  I found this
very
entertaining and surprising; quite subversive and original in actual fact,
more likely to appeal to a greater intellect than that of a 13 year-old
the
jokes are more ironic and subtle in general, with a few obvious
"gross-out"
moments sprinkled in between.  Though these as well are done with tongue
firmly in cheek.

I would highly recommend this film, and prepare to be presently surprised
by
a film that most people fobbed off as another teen movie, but which is
actually a lot more than that.

If you like teenage/college humor and dirty jokes, this is your movie.
The whole movie is basically goofy college humor and most movies like
that don't really have a well thought out movie. With this they had all
of that without forgetting about what the movie was about or ruining
the story at the end. I felt very sorry for Dave when Ethan lied to
Angela about him. Luckily they got everything settled out. I liked some
of the actors and actresses who played minor characters in the movie
too like Michael McDonald, Retta and Jim Rash. I'm surprised actor
Michael C. Maronna isn't as big as he is because he was funny in this
movie. He should get himself into more movies like this. See this movie
if you haven't seen it. If you have, see it again.

Slackers is a very funny and enjoyable teen movie. Of course it's dumb, but
who cares, you'll get a few laughs and feel like you did something
worthwhile for two hours. Anyways, Slackers is about three friends that
always cheat their way through tests and always get away with it until the
psychopathic school geek ethan(Jason Schwartzman) finds out and starts
blackmailing them. Unless one of the cheaters named Dave(Devon Sawa) can get
the beautiful Angela(James King) to go out with Ethan, he will kick Dave and
both of his friends out of the school. Jason Schwartzman was very funny and
also Laura Prepon did a very funny performance. She played Angela's sex
crazed roomate Reanna.
Devon Sawa did also a pretty good job. If you want to see a movie that will
make you laugh and just plain relax for two hours, watch
slackers.
I would give Slackers 6/10

This film looked promising but it was actually pretty bad.  The premise was
O.K, but the plot itself was terrible.  The actors tried their best with
limited material, but they could not rise above the mean spiritedness of
this tacky college film.  Jason Schwartzman was once again immensely
irritating - even more so than in Rushmore, the rest of the cast were quite
non-eventful.  Scenes that should have been fun turned out to be off-putting
& incredibly juvenile.  Tries to be a Road Trip/American Pie but fails
dismally on all levels.  A total waste of everyone's time.

Just when you begin to think that the teen movie genre can't get any
worse,
along comes a film like `Slackers' to remind us that barrel-bottom
scraping
has long stood as one of Hollywood's most lucrative and time-honored
traditions.

`Slackers' features a trio of amoral buddies who spend most of their time
devising elaborate schemes to help each other cheat their way through
college.  Starting from this rather dubious premise, the film proceeds to
encompass every clich√© from every teen comedy ever made.  With few
exceptions, the characters are all unlikable oafs, some of whom actually
seem to be suffering from some serious cases of mental illness.  It's a
little difficult to laugh when you begin to see someone as a genuine
threat
to the safety and welfare of other people in the vicinity.

As with most youth comedies, `Slackers' serves up a plethora of crude sex
gags, only in this case, none of them come across as particularly witty or
imaginative.  In an attempt to achieve a certain `originality' the film
also
throws in a few `fantasy' sequences that fall flat through sheer lack of
inspiration.  Moreover, the college classroom scenes are all appallingly
unconvincing, particularly in terms of the kinds of shenanigans that are
permitted during test-taking times.  And the silly, all's-forgiven ending
rings as hollow as everything else in the film.

`Slackers' bombed big time at the box office upon its release in early
2002.
Perhaps that shows that Hollywood CAN go broke underestimating the
intelligence of its audience after all.  It gives one cause for hope.

Well, I just ordered this on my pay-per-view at home because I was bored
and
needed a laugh. I have to admit, I did chuckle a few times, but I don't
even
remember what parts they were at. I don't understand why this movie was
made. It claims to be a comedy but seriousuly, I don't find a singing
penis,
or a naked 70 year old woman very funny. This movie was trying to fit
itself
into the 'gross-out' comedies of recent years such as American Pie and
Road
Trip, but it just failed miserably. It was way to much gross-out then it
was
comedy. Also, why on earth did Cameron Diaz attach her name to this
movie?!?! The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela
were in the pool. I thought it was sexy and enjoyable and well-done.
Besides
that, avoid this movie. 3/10

Love, hate, fun, blackmail, cheating, slacking, faking, should be good huh
?! Well, once again, WRONG. It's another cheap story, with no action, low
humor and some collage underlife. Waste your money on something else, this
sucks. I'm sorry for the casting, maybe in some other screenplay they
would
be better...
<|_=00=_|>
It was so terrible. It wasn't fun to watch at all. Even the scene where
the girl is using a vibrator, even that's not fun to watch in this
movie. I say again, the scene where a girl is masturbating with a
vibrator is not even fun to watch. Or maybe if that was the only part
of the movie that you watched, just girl on couch using a vibrator.
Maybe they should have just released that one scene in theaters, maybe
then the movie would be enjoyable on a certain level. My advice, fast
forward to that point, watch it, rewind the movie, watch it again,
rewind, repeat. Maybe you could enjoy yourself for 2 hours that way.
This movie ranks alongside I spit on your grave and Doom generation in
the category of worst movies that I have ever seen.
<|_=00=_|>
This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was deceived into thinking
it might be good because a couple of my favorite actors are in it. Now
I want to punch Jason Schwartzman in the face for taking this role. I
was physically ill after watching this film. I really don't understand
Hollywood sometimes. There are so many people trying to break in that
I'm sure you can skim off the top and get the very best. That way the
worst movie you make is equivalent to Ferris Beullar instead of this
sludge. The gags like the hair doll and blatantly ripping off jeans
commercials added to the humorlessness of the film. Glad I avoided this
film and watched it on TV. This proves that you should avoid January
releases at all cost.
