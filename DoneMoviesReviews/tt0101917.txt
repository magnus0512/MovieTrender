Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, the sixth installment of the
Nightmare on Elm Street series and once again another bad sequel. I
think this is tied up with the last sequel of the Dream Child. I was
lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street series box DVD set for
my birthday, so I got to see all the sequels. May I say that I'm just
getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels, at least
the past two, it just seems like Freddy lost his edge. It's almost like
the writers were trying to give Freddy a soul and they're just
destroying it instead of reinventing the story. This was a sequel that
wasn't needed, sorry to Robert Englund, but this was very much below
what Freddy Krueger represents.

Freddy is back, but he's got something we don't know about, a daughter.
Maggie, she's not aware that he is her father, but soon she finds out
what his dark secrets are and he wants her help. She has to do her best
to resist his powers, but it's hard with all the good memories she has
of her loving father. Ironic, isn't it? But Freddy isn't giving up
without manipulating her into his ways.

Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare is also presented in 3-D, radical,
huh? Note the sarcasm. This is one of the worst sequels, it's tied up
with the fifth sequel of the Nightmare on Elm Street series, I'd rather
watch the second Nightmare on Elm Street to be honest. This just had
bad acting, stupid editing, and just over all a bad idea for a story. I
didn't like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who
Freddy Krueger really is, the death master of nightmares, not Father
Knows Best.

2/10
<|_=00=_|>

I guess I'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film.  Is it one of
the best of the "Nightmare" series?  Maybe not, but I had lots of fun with
it.  Freddy Krueger reaches his evil, wisecracking potential.  Since parts 4
and 5 kind of lagged the series down, I felt this so-called final
installment ("New Nightmare" is the real finale) brought the series out of
its slump.  There are some great nightmare sequences, including one where
Breckin Meyer plays a stoner who gets trashed, falls asleep and gets stuck
in a video game to which Freddy controls.  This is both a highly original
and hilarious sequence, especially when we see him out of the dreamscape,
hopping around like Super Mario.  And Freddy belts out the funny one-liner,
"Great graphics."  And since the movie was made about 10 years ago, it
brought back memories when Freddy started controlling the game with the
Powerglove.  Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers the
Powerglove.  

The cast is superb.  Lisa Zane is perfectly cast in the lead.  I haven't
seen Yaphet Kotto since "The Running Man," and I think the last time I saw
that film was about 5 years ago.  He's another great, underappreciated actor
who possesses a powerful screen presence.  And who can forget the cameos? 
The best one is by Johnny Depp (from the first "Nightmare") playing a
spokesman for an anti-drug commercial.  

The 3D sequence at the end is really awesome!  So for those who are looking
to check this film out--please rent or buy it on DVD!  Hopefully all the
editions come with the 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video edition has the 3D
element removed.  

I personally didn't see many things wrong with the film.  It even elaborated
on Freddy's backstory.  The film is a great mix of humor and scares, and the
gross-out effects are terrific.  Could this have given better justice to the
franchise?  Of course it could have.  But Rachel Talalay did a fine job. 
And finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done.

And in closing, I loved the montage over the opening credits.  Fans of the
series will be delighted, and will look at it as a tribute to beloved
Freddy.   

My score:  7 (out of 10)
<|_=00=_|>
Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) was the last film to feature
Freddy Krueger as a solo act (not as an entity or a co-star). The years
of killing have taken a toll upon the town of Springwood. It has gotten
to the point that the little city has become a virtual ghost town. The
parents who killed Freddy Krueger so many years ago have all paid the
ultimate price. Only the mad inhabit the town and the survivors are
scattered everywhere. But that doesn't stop Freddy from seeking out his
final revenge. No matter how they try to stop him, he always comes back
for more. But this time he finds out a little more about his old life.
Can the kids finally stop Freddy for good? What is this secret that is
buried in Freddy's twisted mind? to find out you'll have to watch
Freddy's Dead. the end was originally filmed in 3-D.

A fitting way to end the franchise. Freddy learns something about
himself and his perverted life and he gets to go out in a bang! Lisa
Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger star in this final installment.
Rosanne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make special appearances. A whole
lot better than the last one but it's filled with a few dated jokes. If
you enjoy the series then you don't want to miss out on this one.

I have to recommend this movie for Freddy fans.

Freddy Krueger (Robert Engund) brings the last survivor of Sprinwood to
a big city. The police withdraw the teenager with amnesia from the
streets and bring him to a shelter under the care of Maggie Burroughs
(Lisa Zane). She finds a picture of her hometown Springwood in his few
belongings and decides to take the John Doe (Shon Greenblatt) back to
the town trying to recover his memory. During the travel to Springwood,
she finds three others interns hidden in the van. When they reach
Springwood, Maggie discovers that she was adopted by her mother and her
father is Freddy Krueger.

"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare" is the sixth part of this classic
movie and is a very weak and disappointing sequel. The story is silly,
with a dark humor that never works, despite the cameo of Johnny Depp.
Further, it shows a total lack of imagination of the writer, and proves
that the franchise is exhausted. My vote is five.

Title (Brazil): "A Hora do Pesadelo 6: Pesadelo Final  A Morte de
Freddy" ("The Hour of the Nightmare 6: Final Nightmare  The Death of
Freddy")
<|_=00=_|>
Now all the kids and teenagers of Springwood, Ohio are all dead expect
for one teenager (Shon Greenblatt) is still alive. Freddy (Robert
Englund) is letting him go and the teenager doesn't have much of a
memory, when he's arriving in a new town. When a tough female
psychologist (Lisa Zane) tries to break though the new patient. She's
finds out, where he's from. She brings him along to Springwood to spark
some memories but three teens (Lezlie Deane, Breckin Meyer and Ricky
Dean Logan), who unexpected came for the ride. Once they arrived in
Springwood, the psychologist has some memory that she did lived in that
town before as a child. While Freddy knows the true secret of her true
identity.

Directed by Rachel Talalay (Ghost in the Machine, Tank Girl) made a
grim but somewhat oddly different sequel with some visual style and
funny moments for this horror/fantasy/thriller. Yaphet Kotto (Alien)
has a supporting role as a Psychologist expert on dreams. This has some
ingenious visual effects (Not everyone will love the climax, especially
in 3-D) and some good style in its storytelling. This one did out gross
some of the film's series at the box office.

DVD has an strong anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (also in Pan
& Scan) and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has the
original theatrical trailer, Jump to a Nightmare opinion and Cast &
Crew information. The "Elm Street" Series Box Set, the eighth disc has
interviews with the the cast & crew of this sixth film. The sixth film
is also in 3-D for the film climax but you could watch it at 2-D also.
This is the last of the "Elm Street" films until Wes Craven resurrected
Freddy into a different, darker style in "New Nightmare" and the silly
but surprisingly enjoyable spin-off horror film "Freddy Vs Jason".
Watch for Robert Shaye (Co-Owner and Co-CEO of "New Line Cinema"),
Roseanne Barr, Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper in amusing
cameos. Written by Michael De Luca (John Carpenter's In the Mouth of
Madness). From a story by the director. (*** ½/*****).
<|_=00=_|>

My least favorite of the entire series.  While not a total loss, you do come
away feeling cheated.  The redeeming qualities of this flick are:  the
continued exploration into Freddy's past.  (HELLO NEW LINE - DO THE
NIGHTMARE PREQUEL - IF YOU MAKE IT WE WILL COME!)  This was one whacked
joker.  The 3D sequences were good, but the ending totally
blew.

Pros:  Opening Sequence -- Cons:  Ending -- Bottom Line:  Still better than
alot of other horror crud 5/10!
<|_=00=_|>

freddy's dead, jason goes to hell, mikey gets a razor in his
candy?

this is the ultimate WTF? film.  the beginning alone, with the map, and
the
computer stuff across the country, WTF?!?  no returning characters, WTF?
freddy riding a broomstick from wizard of oz, WTF?

some redeeming qualities:
i don't like to know too much in horror stories, it's part of what makes
them spooky, we learn too much of freddy here, though the flashbacks are
well done, like the razor/pain thing

freddy has a daughter and that's why he went nuts, but we haven't heard
of
it until now, WTF?  tom and rosey, WTF?  that town is supposed to be
where
the last 5 films took place?  WTF?  demon ghost skulls?  WTF?  3D (and i
still have my 3D glasses from the theater), WTF?  cheap excuses to amaze
us
in 3D???  WTF???

but... alas, it is fun to watch, and ultimately degrades the original and
cheapens the franchise, but it is entertaining, a true guilty pleasure
flick... though, why does it kill him here and not when nancy does it???

series rating: 2/10
guilty pleasure rating: 7/10

I grew up on these, but somehow had never seen part 6, so thirteen
years later, I checked it out this morning. I should've slept in. Not
just the worst "Nightmare" movie, but one of the worst films of all
time. Yes, Freddy hasn't been scary since the second film, but at least
he had some good joke writers up until part 4. New Line execs Talalay
and DeLuca thought they could write and direct a film...not-uh. This
time around it's like a ten-year-old penned his quips that are
eye-rollingly bad. Freddy on a broomstick?? Freddy playing Nintendo??
Man, not only is Freddy dead, the series has been dead since the end of
part 4. Although I can say I'd still watch part 5 over this. The plot
is the worst slog of any of the films, as Freddy even disappears for a
half hour while the thing is laid out. The lead that is carrying it all
is one of the weakest actors I've encountered, Shon Greenblat. His look
and delivery is all wrong, the same going for Ricky Dean Logan. His
death scene is one of the stupidest things I've ever watched, as he's
agonizingly slain with a Q-tip (stop laughing). Screaming endlessly in
a dorky pitch, it's painful for the viewer as well. The Nintendo death
is horrifically idiotic as well, as all slasher-film tone is demolished
as a victim jumps all over a room in a trance, ala a video game
character. Complete with jump sound effects and superhuman strength, it
was the moment where I raised a hand to the screen going "Come on, what
is this crap?". And after Freddy is dead, star Zane and her "Freddy's
dead!", and head-tossing smile puts a cap on this steaming mess of a
movie. Later Fred, thanks for the 80s memories, I don't blame you, but
the writers.

   ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***
What 's the matter with you people ? Why is EVERYBODY trashing this
film
? It is usually the same persons who dislike part 2 which was also
neat.
Not only Freddy 's Dead is good , it is very good because it contains
everything : inventive plot twists , engaging reoccuring dreams ,
hallucinating atmosphere ( a city on the border of reality and fantasy
with
weird adults and no kids at all ) , marvellous flashbacks and FINALLY a
reasonal explanation about the Freddy Krueger phenomena.
After 5 movies it was NEVER explained exactly how it is
possible
that a dead person torments people in their dreams and manages to
kill
them by manifesting nightmares . At last , we have some substandard
explanation . After the horrible #4 and the mediocre #5 not only we have
improvement scriptwise but we have very interesting characters . Sure the
video game sequence is kind of corny but the rest of the deaths were
frightful. If anyone of you says that was not scared with Freddy killing
the
kid with the hearing problem is a total liar .
The girl who plays Tracy simply kicks a** . She is dynamic
and
fights for her live in a very realistic way . Towards the end you
will
find yourself GLUED in your couch . You are very concerned for the
lives
of the characters . The script has a few inconsistencies like it is never
explained how Freddy erased the existance of his victums from
the
memories of the others . It does not matter . The basic premise is
for
a teenager who believes he is the long lost son of Freddy Krueger and

is stalked by him . He ends up in an asylum and being supervised by
a
male and female doctor who consider the idea of hypnosis and dream
manipulation ( OK it reminds a bit of part 3 but we can forgive that
).
The female doctor escorts him in a strange city to investigate for
his
roots and Freddy . Along with them go 3 more kids with problematic
domestic
backgrounds (e.g. one of them is Tracy being sexually abused
by
her own father) . I won't spoil the rest . The scenes in the strange city
are Gothic and effective . The final showdowns between the
heroes
and the killer are the most intense in the entire series ,
excellently
tied up with delusional flashbacks which after 6 movies are original

and prove that the dreamlike atmosphere can STILL be accepted and not
a
tired rehash .
The writers made a perfect job . We learn all we wanted to
know
about Freddy 's history and the script neatly ties most of the loose ends
of
the series . There is a complaint " Why again drag him into
the
real world ? It didn 't work when Nancy(in #1) and Jesse(in #2) tried
it
" . I will have to remind you that they never actually managed to
KILL
him . He was defeated but not destroyed . Part 6 is not the best but one
of
the best in the series . FORGET the bad reviews and give it a

shot . There is an extra bonus : you finally see what is the real
face
of Freddy before burned ( this scene is also included so you MUST SEE IT)
.
There are also slight references to the prequels . And a very
cool
hint : the vast ARSENAL of weaponry in the end !!!!
See it alone and very late at night . You will be spooked.
Fab cast , fab script , fab SFX and direction , fab fun.

EXCELLENT !!!!                    8.5 / 10

(and for God 's shake skip the tragedy of part 7 at all
costs)


<|_=00=_|>

I love most of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies(number 2 really sucked. 
The final Freddy movie wasn't to bad.   In my opinion they are a lot better
than the Friday the 13th movies.  However, I wish this movie had more guts
and gore and was more scarier.  Don't get me wrong I love Freddy's sense of
humor but I love to see people get butchered into little pieces.  I  also
loved how they showed Freddy as a human being in the last Freddy movie.
Robert Englund is a sweetie. =)
