This movie always cracks me up. I should note that I'm SO not a fan of
Andrew "Dice" Clay, I think his stand-up shows suck, big time. But
here, he's simply fantastic as Ford Fairlane, the Rock'n Roll
Detective, who mostly gets paid in the form of gifts or memorabilia.

Dice's jokes here work perfectly each time, one quotable line after
another ("so many assholes, so few bullets", "you're a poet and didn't
know it", "talking with Zuzu is like ************ with a
cheese-grinder, slightly enjoyable but mostly painful" to name a few).
The film never takes itself seriously, yet somehow keeps it from ever
going into slapstick territory.

Supporting actors do well also, Presly is always a stunner, Wayne
Newton gives his best ever performance as Fairlane's nemesis and Ed
O'Neill is a riot as a former disco singer turned detective. Robert
Englund gives a rather amusing performance as a very inept crook who's
ultimate fate is nothing short of hilarious.

Finnish director Harlin directs with a sure hand, everything in the
technical department in tip top shape and it's very visually stylish at
times. The Adventures of Ford Fairlane is definitely not for everyone,
but it's not only for die hard Clay fans, since I sure as hell ain't
one of them. But I think he's perfect here and the film is very funny
and comes highly recommended by me.

First of all, what a great movie. None stop laughs from one of the very
few
comedians who can sell out Madison Square Garden. Not only was Dice's
performance "Unbelievable" the supporting cast held a lot of big named
actors. Wayne Newton, Priscilla Presley, Lauren Holly, and the guy who
played Freddy Kruger....yeah, what's his name?
Anyway, this got a terrible review from the powers to be because it was
considered Dice comedy. Still, you can't watch Ford Fairlane without
laughing a few times.

Sure there is crude humor, but it's *Dice Clay*. He is who he is. This
actually seemed cleaned up a bit for him. Mr Rock and roll detective
gets to investigate the death of Vince Neil. You throw in Precilla
Presley, Gilbert Godfried, Ed O'Neill. That is a recipe for just funny.
*Very funny*, lots of good one liners, very quotable. Then again, I
evidently have the mental capacity of a dead hamster. ;) If for nothing
else, it is a definite watcher for fashion don'ts. Yes we *really* did
dress that way in the late 80's early 90's, it was very "Rock and
Roll", we thought we were cool. Though now I can't imagine why...
Excellent time-period comedy. It's a re-watcher.

The Adventures of Ford Fairlane looks pretty much at the Diceman at his
stand-up comedy best.  But, this time, he has a character and is a rock and
roll detective.  As usual he is the offensive Dice.  Off-color, crude, and
for me (a rabid Dice fan) utterly dead pan funny.  But though I find Andrew
Dice Clay to be a good actor, many people might see this movie and think
that he is just using this film as an excuse for people to see his stand-up
act.  Well, like the film, the opinions are two sided.  You either love the
Diceman's comedy, or utterly hate it.  I'm going for the upper.  Great
comedy and entertainment in this block-buster that rocketed Dice. 
A+

The title of my post says it all for the ratings this movie received. I
mean
less than a 5?? This movie is in the cult classic section in every video
store I go to! Sure this movie was harsh and witty while poking fun at the
music industry of the late 80s/early 90s. And for those of you familiar
with
the late 80s/early 90s music scene, you'll remember how chaotic it was
back
then! This movie is a testament to all the decadent happenings during that
time. Although filled with campy one-liners, an all-star cast, and
extremely
vulgar material, it's a Dice movie after all! That's how it's supposed to
be! Granted this movie is not for everyone, it's still fun to just sit
there
and laugh along with the movie's gags. Offensive maybe, cheesy maybe. Get
over it ya wimp!
<|_=00=_|>

There's profanity. Lots of it. PC is out the window! It's derogatory to
women. And I can't help but love it. Taking into account the heavily
polarized views it's safe to say that you will either hate it or you'll love
it. Middle road is very unlikely. But rest assured, IF you love it, the
movie will probably make it into your top 10 easy. And after all, that's not
all that bad a chance to take.
It's not for everyone - I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic evening with
your girlfriend. Maybe with your wife :).. But give it a try. You might not
hate it.

Andrew Dice Clay, now THERE was a man who was ahead of his time, If he came
a decade or two later he would have been heralded as the acting equivalent
of say, Eminem.. You know except with talent. OOOOH! Hey is this thing on??
Anyways this movie is greatness & one of my "guilty pleasures". So many
quotable lines. So many great cameos. I heard Roger Ebert HATED this
movie..yeah Ebert, I F#%^ed him OOOOH!! Seriously go see this movie... NOW,
snapperhead.

My Grade: B+

DVD Extras: featurette; Billy Idol music video; theatrical
trailer

This film is the perfect comedy/action film of its era! This film is
absolutely perfect in every way! Andrew dice Clay is perfect in the
part. The writing is excellent. The acting is good. The comic timing is
impeccable. Everything works! The music is fantastic. Lauren holly is
gorgeous! Clay is in his prime, and at his peak. Everything about this
film is perfect! Wayne Newton as the bad guy, is great. Ed O'Neal is
great. People want to hate on Clay, but he was the most popular
comedian at the time! He literally was a rock star of comedy! I highly
recommend this movie! It is like the perfect snapshot of the late
80's/early 90's.

FF reminds me much of Howard Stern's flick - you had those that bash it
without ever seeing it! Just like Howard's bio - FF is excellent. Its
like reading an adult joke book - just that it's up on the big screen.

Clay's acting is better than Stern's. He really knew what he was doing
and has great screen presence. This movie SCREAMS for a sequel.

Buy it. I just got my copy at HTTP://committed.to/bestdeals You can't
always find it in stores but Blockbuster does have it from time to
time.

It is a film that is easy to watch. No thinking required. Chill on the
couch with some buds and get goofy.

Enjoy!

Alright. I know the acting isn't 5 star quality, but really, NOT EVERY
FREAKING movie is meant to be Gone With the Wind.

Sometimes you have to just have some fun, enjoy a night of laughter,
and the enjoy the movie for what it is: Nutty! I'm beyond tired of the
PC world we live in today. It's OK to laugh sometimes.

I love the dialog in the movie, as well as the one-liners made by Dice.
There's plenty of star quality in the movie with Priscilla Pressley, Ed
O'Neil, Wayne Newton, Robert Englund, and Lauren Holly, so lets stop
acting like the movie was filled with off the street actors. They all
knew they were in a fun movie together, and all had fun being in it.

So, if you are someone who likes to laugh at silly jokes, one liners,
and enjoy crude humor, then this is a movie for you.
