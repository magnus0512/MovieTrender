After mistaking a Halloween re-broadcast of Orson Welles' classic radio
adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS for a real Martian invasion, a group of
moronic Martians shows up on Earth looking to conquer only their plans
go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in
reality all alone.

This really is often quite good and funny, with some decent lines (just
check the memorable quotes) to boot. It will most likely appeal to
Sci-Fi fans. This has passed the test of time for me as seeing it again
recently it proved much better than I expected it to be. Despite a cast
made up of no-name stars, this may just be the funniest Martian
invasion ever put to film. Interestingly enough, the Martians
themselves seem to represent almost every classic Action Hero/Sci-Fi
Hero stereotype there is (cool 50s teen, fighter pilot, fearless
astronaut, brave soldier and kooky scientist). Fun for the whole
family.

I first saw this movie in 1990 when it first came out on video.  I
agree
that it is total nonsense, but it is also one of the funniest movies that I
have ever seen.  The very idea that a group of "advanced aliens" would be
running for thier lives from a bunch of country hicks is totally
side-spliting.
Why do all science fiction movies have to be about murderous beings? This
group of Imperial Martian Atomic Navy misfits reminds me of some of the
idiots that I knew in the army!  No wonder they were left on asteroid patrol
while the rest of the fleet went to war.  Leave this movie alone.  We need
more like it.

Looking at some of the negative posts, you really have to wonder what some
people do for fun....

I was lucky enough to see the film during its all-too-brief theatrical run. 
The audience laughed its heads off.  I'm watching a tape of it as I type and
it's still dang funny!

It's also got a sweet side, with unexpected turns of genuine pathos. The
late, great Royal Dano is especially effective as the lonely,
down-on-his-luck farmer Wrenchmuller.  Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson are
great as the lead kids.  And the actors in the Martian suits, although
limited to mime, do a great job

Another thing to look for is the background details. The film is full of
homages, pastiches, and references to other SF and fantasy films. Take a
look at the Martian costumes next time.  One of them is wearing a Marty
McFly costume, another is a Ghostbuster, a third is in a House Atreides
uniform, and a fourth is wearing a Last Starfighter flightsuit.

I've watched this movie so many times the video is worn out. It is a
movie I can put on whenever I need a good laugh. The farmer is
hilarious, the duck boy is too. It's an overall feel good movie. Even
kids 12 and up can watch it without being inundated with sexual
innuendos, violence and cursing. The TNT award at the end is the
best... "well, you can just say your prayers." LOL Oh yea, and so are
the two old guys and the old woman after the martians fly by them when
they are crash-landing on earth - "okay, go get the bucket" It's great!
I think kids under 10 might be frightened by the enforcer drone, maybe.
I don't know though, with all the crap they see on TV on a regular
basis, it might not be. So go out an rent it today! If you have
Blockbuster Rewards(TM) program, you can use one of your free rentals
and you'll enjoy.

This movie is not for everyone.  You're either bright enough to get "it"
or
you're not.  Fans of sci-fi films who don't take themselves too seriously
definitely will enjoy this movie. I recommend this movie for those who can
appreciate spoofs and parodies.  Everyone I've recommended this film to
has
enjoyed it.  If you enjoy Monty Python or Mel Brooks films, you'll
probably
enjoy this one.  The voice characterizations are done in a tongue-in-cheek
manner and the one-liners fly fast and furious.
<|_=00=_|>

Zany and fun -- that's all this movie is about!  Don't think about trying
to
read too much into it.  If you do, you'll be sorely disappointed.  It's
just
a farcical take-off on monster movies and contains some real good
slapstick
moments.  No violence, no sex, no foul language -- safe for the kids and
fun
for the adults!!

I don't know how anyone could hate this movie. It is so funny.  It took a
unique mind to come up with this storyline.  It's not your typical alien
movie.  These aliens are so stupid and confused.  You need to rent it at
least once.
<|_=00=_|>

Stupid? Yes.

Laughable? Yes, again.

Fun? Definitely!  

This movie accomplishes it's primary goal: entertain and have fun. That's
all a good movie need do.

Worth a rent, at least one time.

I thought this would be another goofball ET ripoff (like the awful
"Nookie"), but it
is, instead is light-heartedly enthusiastic,  with clever dialog, and a
generally
don't-take-ourselves-too-seriously attitude that makes this a great
late-night (or
late-saturday-afternoon) entertainment.   Give it a watch!  "That's it!
Take me to a
Government Lab, and cut me into wafer thin sections."

"I moved out here to get away from this kind of thing!" The small town
sheriff laments.

"This happens a lot in Chicago?" His deputy asks.

Well, no, not really. The plot is that a group of Martians mistake a
Halloween Rebroadcast of Orson Welles' War of the Worlds as an account
of a real Martian invasion, and conclude they need to get in on the
action! What follows are a bunch of mishaps involving the Martian's
haphazard attempts to conquer the town of "Big Bean, IL". Everyone
concludes they are kids in really good costumes, except for the
Sheriff's daughter and her friend, a kid in a duck suit.

The Martians themselves are comical, and you get the impression they
are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on. It's a fun
family movie.
