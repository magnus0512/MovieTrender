why anyone would choose to watch this movie and then turn
around and complain about how awful it is baffles me.  you're
given a silly title, Hot to Trot, Bobcat Goldthwait as a star, and a
blurb mentioning a talking horse.  how could this movie NOT be
utterly stupid?  of COURSE it is stupid! and that's why it's
great!
sure, the jokes are juvenile and rather stupid, though in my opinion
there are a few zingers in there (how is a three-stoogie horse
humping a Volvo NOT funny?) but sometimes that's what you want
to watch: utter stupidity.  this movie succeeds as a brainless
comedy with easy to grasp humor and blatant...stupidity! i sincerely
doubt it ever tried to be more than just that.  so, for what it is, it's a
huge success, and if you want to sit back and not think and enjoy
an 80s flavored 80 minutes with a talking horse and an annoying
guy whose jockey pants are too tight, then by all means, i highly
highly recommend this movie.  if you're too uptight to relax and
enjoy it on some level, then yeah, skip it. i've personally seen it at
least 20 times since it opened in theaters when i was 9 years old,
it's in my video collection and a favorite to pop in when i'm sick,
cleaning or trying to get someone to laugh and feel silly, and yeah
it sits surrounded by films by the likes of  Wim Wenders and
Jeunet, above The Seventh Seal and to the right of Dr. Strangelove.

It just gets funnier, every time I see it! The cultural subtext is
genius. Bobcat is the idealistic misfit from a previous generation
wandering lost through the 80's as yuppy Republicans seize control of
America. A talking horse is just as reliable as any "stock" expert at
picking winning stocks. It shows the utter ridiculousness of that
profession. The cartoonish nature of the movie represents the cynical
rejection of reality espoused by punk rock and other revolutionary
movements of the time. I guess you just had to be there to understand
it. Today, greedy corporate types have so subsumed this country that it
is difficult to remember a time when they did not dominate. This movie
brilliantly illustrates the culture clash that was occurring at that
time. Vietnam and Watergate elevated protest to an art form, especially
the DaDa, surrealist, mocking the system type of commentary.

Seabiscuit is actually based on this masterwork.  "The horse that
couldn't
win".... yep, that was Don before it was Seabiscuit... "The jockey no one
wanted".... Goldthwait long before Tobey... "The obnoxious outsider
owner"... Bobcat again.  The big climactic race... yes, Seabiscuit fans,
you
HAVE seen it all before.

Hot to Trot was a film before its time.  Dabney Coleman's performance is
magical.  Virginia Madsen's best performance where she kept her clothes
on.
And Candy is a master of horse dialects.

Two hoofs up!  Ten stars!  Fabulous!  Mucilage!

Just watched it again for about the third time. Yep, it's similar to
Mr. Ed, but if you check your movie history, most of the movie releases
are clones to what's been done; just a little twist here and there.
Animal movies have proven themselves over and over again to be winners.
This one's no different. If you're not an old-fart yet, you got at
least one more hilarious flick to see. Thank God I'm open minded, not
high-strung, nor hanging on too tight to appreciate this side-splitter.
It's FUNNY!! Even if you don't get a laugh out of it, you'll at least
get to watch Virginia Madsen strut her stuff. Relax with a drink and a
snack, give it a look and laugh yourself light-headed!!!

I loved this movie....it's one of the funniest movies ever.  Sure, it's
probably one of the worst movies ever at the same time.  But, this movie
makes me laugh and laugh and laugh.

Bobcat, though annoying at times, is hilarious.  John Candy is excellent
as
the voice of Don the Horse.

I wish I still had this movie, I sold it but had watched it a lot back
in the day. It has everything a good old Jerry Lewis movie would have.
Bobcat's "character" is a combination of his old crazy Police Academy
self, and a new sort of guy that wants to fit in and make it in
society. There's a lot of great characters in this. Although it's
predictable, the execution makes it worth the ride every time. It's not
"viral" or anything. It's a hidden gem for people who appreciate the
classics but also like it when things just get outright silly. The
unexplained things that get written in to this kind of comedy make it
what it is. This isn't going to impress any snobs who have never farted
or talked in a funny voice. But it doesn't rely on toilet humor either.
It's just right.

Okay, this movie is damn funny. How could you not laugh at Bobcat
Golthwait?
With a voice like that? Come on, it's nothing but comic genius!
Seriously, I
first saw this movie when I was about 6 and have loved it ever since. If
you
enjoy comedies aimed at adult audiences that in effect appeal to six year
olds, this film is definitely for you. (it may also fall into that
category
of "this movie is so bad you have to check it out just to believe that
somebody agreed to make it..." also in this category: "Eating Raoul", the
early Val Kilmer gem "Real Genius", "Killer Klowns From Outer Space",
"Big
Momma's House", the list is neverending)

I must have seen a different movie from all the other commenters, because
this is one of the funniest films I have ever seen. John Candy, even
though
only his voice is used, steals the film!!
The funniest part is when "Don, the horse" is feeling lonely and some
animals invade the apartment and have a party and destroy the apartment in
the process!!
I admit, I was one of the ones who voted this a 10!! LOL.
It is a funny film!!

When it comes right down to it, my love for "Hot to Trot" stems from
childhood. That's the best way to put it. I watched this movie all the
time on HBO as a kid, and I loved it. And what makes this stand up
today (for me) is that I find even more humor as an adult in John
Candy's performance. He's what makes this movie so damn likable. I know
that, deep down, it's just a silly horse movie, and without that key
casting decision (Goldthwait, too, let's not count him out), this would
have disaster written all over it.

But it's Candy's warmth and comedic charm that makes this work so well.
I have no idea how well this would hold up if I were watching it with
fresh adult eyes, but as it stands, I have quite the soft spot for "Hot
to Trot".

7/10

People may think I am crazy, but I feel like if they didn't have the
talking animals (well, any animals at all), it would serve as a great
satire. See, you have Dabney Coleman, which many remember as the boss
in 9 to 5. In the 80s, he served as a face to the ruling class. His
character, Walter, is the boss. Then comes Bobcat Goldthwait's
character, Fred. Fred gets an inheritance of many shares of the
company. Walter thinks Fred, the face of the proletariat, is dumb
enough to make an offer of, like, $50 for all the shares that would be
worth millions. So, yeah, without the animals this would make for great
satire. (All of the above is not at all spoiling anything. All happen
towards the very beginning.)
