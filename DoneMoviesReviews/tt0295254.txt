'Feardotcom' was filmed in Luxembourg (apparently standing in for New
York, I think.) and hasn't been officially released yet. I saw it as
one of the featured films during the Luxembourg International Film
festival. (Cinenygma) - One of the executive producers, who introduced
the film, said it wasn't 100% finished yet, and that even the title
might change. However, since every second of the film was even more
tortuous than the depravities depicted on the screen, I believe no
amount of focus groups or editing could save this film. I'd say
'straight to video', but that would be a major waste of plastic and
cardboard. I suppose if they market it as a parody, they might salvage
the cost of, um, the catering during the film.

Stephen Dorff plays a hard-boiled detective who's haunted by that one
case that was never solved. You know he's haunted because he walks
around with a 3 day growth of beard. Which stays at the same length the
whole film, even though the film covers quite a few days (it was hard
tell, nothing was very coherent) And guess what! His old nemesis from
the unsolved case is killing again! Oh boy! And since we now have new
cases to solve, AND they're dying from what looks to be a virus, we
need to bring in the woman scientist and nominal love interest
(Natascha McElhone - who displayed quite amply in 'The Truman Show'
that she can't act. She must work cheap, or maybe they needed someone
to make Dorff look good.) We know she's a scientist because she wears
glasses. And just for grins we get Jeffrey Coombs as Dorff's partner,
whose main role appears to be running around spouting non-sequiturs.
Speaking of which, there was a writer listed for the film but I'd bet a
Ben Franklin that they were making up the dialog as they went along,
and probably for a different film. It's too bad 'Deep Space 9' went off
the air - it might have prevented Coombs from getting caught up in this
travesty. And there's Stephen Rea as the mad scientist, looking vaguely
like Geoffrey Rush mad scientist character in 'Mystery Men.' Now, I
could have sworn Rea could act, so maybe they are two of them?
Amazingly a director is also listed, but from what I can tell they
pretty much turned on the camera, came back later, took the film to the
editing room, forgot to turn on the lights and just started editing.
That would explain a lot.

And what of the plot? Ha! There isn't one! Well, OK, maybe a little
one. I think the deal was that the girl killed in the unsolved case
somehow inhabited the internet and is killing people if they log on to
the mad scientist's site, where HE tortures women until they beg him to
kill them - and all for $9.95! (but just for grins they (the
unfortunates who log into fear.com) only die after 48 hours, because, I
think, that's how long it took her to be killed) But I think you'd need
a broadband connection, because somehow when you login, this girl
living in the internet puts a hex on you, which involves you falling
off your chair and eventually trashing your apartment and nose bleeds,
and um, dying from the fright of your worst fear (like being cast in
this movie) and I really don't think that could happen with a dial up
connection. Um, anyway, she's going to keep on killing people unless
the mad scientist is caught. And her body is found too. I mean they
threw that bit in there about finding the body, but then when it was
found, it didn't count for anything! Now, doesn't that just bite. Damn
fickle internet ghosts.

**SPOILER**

Actually this whole film was a spoiler, at least it smelled spoiled to
me. Anyway - the final scene where Dorff and the McElhone rush into the
mad scientist's lair (located in an abandoned steel mill or nuclear
plant - the film couldn't make up it's mind what it was - it identified
it as both during different scenes in the film) and stop him only
seconds before he's going to kill his latest victim had me rolling in
the aisle with laughter. It was just like watching an old horror film
from the 30's or 40's. Maniacal laughter, bug-eyed expressions of
madness, flashing lights, tilted camera angles. So they manage to save
the girl, but then the mad scientist shoots Dorff, and then stabs
McElhone then Dorff grabs a keyboard and logs into feardot.com which
drives the mad scientist so mad - he dies from fear! Then Dorff dies,
and McElhone, who was in love with Dorff (oh, did I leave that part
out? - apparently they fell madly in love in some 30 second scene
earlier in the film - some real in-depth character development going on
here.) sort of cries over his body, but um, somehow she's no longer
stabbed! Maybe it was her Multi-vitamin.

**END OF SPOILER**

So -um, in conclusion - I can't imagine any changes to this film
possibly making it watchable. I'll be surprised if gets released at all
(though the executive producer said Warner Bros had picked it up for US
distribution, and Columbia-Tri-Star for the rest of the world. Let's
hope they come to their senses.) You have been warned. Go watch 'Donnie
Darko' instead!

I've seen my fair share of bad movies. But I can honestly say that this
is in my top 3 worst movies. Usually, when I see an extremely bad film,
it's so awful that it's funny - which makes it somewhat entertaining.
But this film went into another and far worse category. A film so awful
that I got a headache - not because the plot was so complex and
intelligent, but because the plot was so ridiculous and unrealistic. 

It's simple: when you go in search of a killer, call for backup. Don't
go alone into an empty building. Have some common sense! Unfortunatelt,
all the characters in FeardotCom, seem to have been born without the
common sense gene. 

I could suffer through dozens of cheesy horror flicks where the victim
getting chased by a killer conveniently trips and falls down while the
killer get increasingly closer. . . I could even suffer through poor
acting in a horror flick if the plot is entertaining and at least
scary. 

But, when the plot of a film is neither logical nor entertaining you
get one movie: FeardotCom
<|_=00=_|>
I do not really remember how I came upon this movie, but I do know that
somewhere along the way it has made it's way into my DVD collection. I
do not know if I blindly bought it, was given it as a "gift", or if
someone lent it to me and I just forgot to return it, but whatever way,
it is in there now. I watched it quite some time ago, expecting it to
be decent enough, entertaining at least, because I really liked the
tagline and the premise seemed fun, though I have learned to stay away
from a lot of "technology killing" horrors over the past few years now,
and I remembered before I watched it again recently that I hated it the
first time I watched it, a lot, and it was very negatively reviewed as
well. Watching it again confirmed my feelings.

The film itself is just entirely ridiculous and absurd from beginning
to end with a horrible storyline and lame performances and "thrills".
There is zero to none interesting scenes that make the viewer feel
creeped out or enticed in any way, and the whole film is a joke within
itself. I especially hated the ludicrous characters and twists, and
also the way the story was executed in a poor manner, not being able to
stay with one main idea for too long that it is infuriatingly annoying
to watch the plot, what plot there is at least, unfold. The movie
resembles a little diddy of a film titled "Ringu/The Ring" an awful
lot, though both of those renditions are spectacular and this pales
entirely in comparison, and even though there are some nice settings in
this movie, that is really and truly the only plus side to it.

There are many noticeable errors and plot holes, the dialogue is, for
our inconvenience, not as laughable as one would hope, but corny enough
to get a few giggles now and then, especially some of the deliverances
from the female lead, and the climax/ending is not anywhere near
heartracing or interest sparking, just bland and hardly tolerable.
There are many useless scenes of violence that have no importance
whatsoever except to try and get a rise in the viewer, which was not
accomplished in my situation, and a lot of material is just thrown in
there randomly, which goes back to how I stated it is poorly executed
and extremely mediocre. My summary pretty much warns anyone and
everyone away from this movie, unless you are a masochist and want to
be put through this pain.
<|_=00=_|>
I would estimate that I've seen over a thousand movies in my lifetime.
FeardotCom may very well be the worst of those films. The acting is
bad, the dialogue is worse, and the editing is terrible. The film lacks
coherence, cohesiveness, and, in some parts, comprehensiveness. The
film manages to maintain its unwatchability for over an hour, but by
that point the viewer will probably have already logged onto
www.feardotcom.com in hopes of ending the misery. If I had been able to
give this movie less than a star, I would have done so in a heartbeat.
Do not make the mistake of renting this movie; there's a small chance
it may scare you, but the odds of that happening are not worth sitting
through 90 minutes of some of the worst examples of film-making.

Ok, so my boyfriend and I were going to go see this while it was in the
theaters but we never quite made it (Perhaps it was a divine stroke of
luck). So we rented the DVD from a video store. We were delayed from seeing
it yet again (you'd think we would've taken the hint) and left the DVD disc
at my house. After getting down to watching the movie, I was excited and
ready to be scared. We'd watched The Ring a few nights ago and it easily
gave me nightmares. But despite our hopes that this movie would do the same
job, we were sorely let down.

 The movie had a strong start even if it was confusing. A man is hit by a
subway train when he sees a little girl on the tracks. Why did he jump back
out in front of the train? Then you meet the male lead and his associate in
the police department. Why do they both sound like the stupidest cops you'll
ever see? The female lead knew more about policing than the both of them.
Most of the other actors sounded like they were reading off cue cards and
the plot quickly because unbeliveable (ah yes, I'll let my sick daughter
play in an old steel mill even if she's supposively afraid of sharp things
and on top of that, how did Terry know to listen to the half blind old lady
in the mill? and let's not forget, to get to the site, its "feardotcom.com"
not "fear.com." the doctor got ripped off on his site) By this point in the
movie I begged my boyfriend to let it keep playing just to see if it saved
itself. It didn't. The ending was cliche', and the special effects when they
killed the doctor were the only positive things in the movie. The basic
story for FearDotCom was a creative one...but poorly executed (no pun
intended). Save yourself a rental and go see something else. You'll thank
yourself later.
<|_=00=_|>

About halfway through the movie, I was actually considering giving this a 4,
but the complete and utter lack of reasoning in this movie that made me give
it a 1 I will now try to sum up.

The ghost made a website that people can log (and start hallucinating from)
onto only 48 hours later they will be dead unless they find her body so she
can exact revenge on someone who killed her on another website that people
subscribe to, even though she kills other people in car crashes and train
accidents who had no involvement with her death.

Things I learned from FearDotCom:

-Ghosts are capable of creating websites.

-The internet is inherently evil.

-People who use the internet are freaks.

-People who use the internet are incapable of closing their
eyes.

-A bunch of weird images on a computer can drive someone crazy and make them
hallucinate.

-A bunch of weird images on a movie can drive someone so crazy that they
hallucinate so they think what they are watching makes one ounce of logical
sense.

Obviously the producers of this movie wanted the audience to be driven
insane by the film and have shut off our brains by the time the "ending" has
arrived. Sadly, I was still conscious at the end which didn't explain
anything and only dropped my score from a 4 to a 1.

And it's a very boring movie too. Did I mention this movie
sucks?
<|_=00=_|>
SPOILER FREE COMMENT! (though I don't think that there's anything to
spoil here...) 

I really don't know, how could I force myself not to turn this movie
off after the first 20 minutes or so. In the first 1-2 minutes, I was
hopeful, i thought, that it can't be a bad movie, because it has Udo
Kier in it! My god, how wrong I was...

When the movie reached the 20 minutes mark, I was so desperate, that
I've never been in my life. By then, it was pretty obvious, that this
is a bad movie. It wasn't like that, when a movie seems good at the
start but goes downhill later; no. It was bad from the beginning to the
end.

There is no story. There is no acting. There is no direction.
Character-development? Did you see any characters in this movie? Or can
I even write down the word "movie" regarding this cinematic torture? I
think, not. I won't. Moreover, I won't write anything more about this
awful piece of film-making (Hmm... where did I see film-making in this?
I really need to stop writing this comment, before I write some more
ridiculous stuff. "Filmmaking", holy jeez...).

IMDb's lowest rating is "awful". This word hardly represents the
suffering you go through watching FearDotCom. This is the only movie I
rated 1 on this site, and when the credits started rolling, I
immediately put this movie into the AAAC-category. What does AAAC mean? 

AVOID AT ALL COST!!! 

1/10
<|_=00=_|>

Contains Spoilers
I admit, I wanted to see this movie.  I expected it to be decent, as it was
from the same people who made House On Haunted Hill.  What I didn't expect
was for it to be so bad.

1. What was up with the lighting?  Did they spend the entire budget on the
website graphics and not have enough left over for electricity?

2.  How many times can one movie reuse special effects from House On
Haunted
Hill?  The "ghosts" walking around and having a seizure?  The "ghost" at
the
end looked so much like the "shadow" from HOHH that I was waiting for Famke
Janssen to pop out of it looking for Geoffrey Rush.  The even ripped off
the
gory statues that could be found in the foyer to the basement in HOHH.

3.  How did the main characters fall in love after meeting for two seconds?
They had very little chemistry together.  Which is probably due to the fact
that Natascha McElhone CAN'T ACT!

4.  The website issue and Denise the ghost woman were never really tied
together that well either.  AND, while we're on the subject of little Miss
Ghost Denise, what mother would let her hemopheliac 8 year old walk 2 miles
down the street to play in an old abandoned steel mill?

With a running time of 98 minutes that felt like 3 hours, by the end of
feardotcom I had laughed so much that I really didn't care how it ended.  I
only wish that McElhone hadn't survived either, because the last part of
the
movie, the epilogue of her answering the phone and it being just static
made
no sense either.

Thank God they showed a preview for Ghost Ship!

After reading the description for this video and deciding to purchase
it two days ago, I felt that it might be a worthy horror film.
Unfortunately this movie was a major disappointment. This was
definitely a "hack and slash" film, but it was the plot and continuity
of the film that were cut to pieces. This movie had no redeeming
qualities... The plot was non-existent, the acting was poor, the
effects were poor... The worst part of all is that this movie was
actually released and that there are people that like it. No offense to
these folks, but when the best part of the movie is throwing it in the
trash, you really need to reconsider what you're watching. This could
have been a decent horror film, but all things considered, this movie
ranks a 1 on the rating scale and a 10 on the pain scale.

My suggestion is to watch a horror film such as 'The Ring' or John
Carpenter's 'The Thing.' Both are edge-of-your-seat thrillers that will
show you what horror is meant to be... ;)

<|_=00=_|>
I picked this up this evening for no other reason than the cast. Oh,
sure, now and then I do enjoy a good horror flick (this isn't one) and
was in the mood to watch some mindless goop. Well, FEARDOTCOM is
certainly mindless; indeed, I muttered out loud when the credits were
running, "Oh my God! They actually had a writer!" Could have fooled me
-- I was literally expecting one of those "Script by Committee"
acknowledgments; whoever Josephine Coyle is I sure hope she doesn't
quit her day job (her only other credit listed at IMDb is as a
"production coordinator" for PRESENCE OF MIND in 1999).

And, largely because of that miserable excuse for a script, it winds up
being not a good ANY kind of film: When the bloody hell are film makers
going to realize the rather elementary truth (as in Kindergarten level)
that if you don't have a good script, you don't have a film? Period!
Never mind good production values (and I hate to admit it but they
ain't bad), good direction (this definitely has none of that - Lord!
The number of bloopers is just astonishing SPOILER**Just as a for
instance: When McElhone rushes into the psychiatric ward of the
hospital to talk to Dorff (with no explanation WHY he's in a
psychiatric unit), is directed to his room "first door on the left,"
she is instantly there, finds him having a full-on seizure (with no
medical people in attendance, mind you), and suddenly -- when she, oh,
so frightfully conveniently gets a phone call -- NOW she's got to go
out the door onto a stair landing and through yet another doorway
before she's back in the same corridor! Really good continuity there,
folks!) END SPOILER.

I have admired Stephen Dorff in many films **but this was just, well, a
grunting quasi-Neanderthal that pretty much embodied every tired cliché
there is for a world weary cop since sometime in the 1930s**! (**Oh
yeah! And somebody really should point out to this generally admirable
young actor that if you have a story in which the primary character
doesn't "solve" the main problem, but instead winds up a clueless
bystander, you just don't have a viable story.**) I adored Natasha
McElhone in MRS DALLOWAY (and -- even GIVEN the weaknesses of the
character in the script -- in THE TRUMAN SHOW), and have been an
admirer of Stephen Rea ever since THE CRYING GAME, too -- but I can't
figure out why they agreed to do this one; did they all need some
quick-and-dirty money or something. . . .

Usually one can at least learn something from a genuinely bad movie
(which this is) but with this one, for the very first time, I wanted to
go back to my film rental store and demand my $3.50 back on general
principles.

I'm glad I didn't follow my first impulse to shut the show down at the
end of the "first reel" 20 minute period, because I can quite honestly
report about this disaster of a movie: Dreadful! Just dreadful on every
level except, as I said above, production values. Big deal!
