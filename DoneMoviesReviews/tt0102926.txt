Sweeping all five major Academy Awards ("Oscars" for Best Movie, Director,
Actor, Actress, Screenplay) is quite an accomplishment.  Doing it nearly a
year after a film was released is a miracle considering the notoriously
short attention span of Oscar voters.  It is a powerful example of how great
a movie can be when superb writers, directors, actors, and others work at
the top of their craft.

`Silence of the Lambs' is  the story of a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling
(Jodie Foster) who is summoned to help find one serial killer called
`Buffalo Bill.' by interviewing another.  Foster's performance is absolutely
brilliant.  While Anthony Hopkins receives most of the (well-deserved)
praise for his chilling portrayal of incarcerated serial killer `Hannibal
the Cannibal' Lector', it is Foster's performance that holds the movie
together.  The fear she shows just behind her eyes makes Clarice's outward
courage all the more interesting and vulnerable.  This is the perfect way to
play the part because it explains Lector's interest in Clarice.  Her only
bargaining chip in getting Lector's help is to let him `feed' on her
innermost secrets and fears in exchange for his brilliant insights into the
psychotic mind.  The title of the movie comes from these exchanges and is
very poignant.

Director Jonathan Demme is masterful.  There is one scene late in the movie
that I will not spoil.  It is one of the most simply brilliant scenes ever
staged in a movie.  I don't know if all the credit goes to Demme or the
writers, but there is a moment in the film where the suspense builds
beautifully to a what seems to be a common movie scene.  However, through
skillful timing of the direction, the audiences assumptions are used against
them and when the truth is revealed (hint: it involves a doorbell) it is
shocking and induced a collective gasp from the audience I saw it with at
the theatre.  It set the stage for an edge-of-your seat
climax.

Do not miss this movie.

The movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see.

I've seen way too many thrillers. You name it: "Identity", "Seven", "The
Usual Suspects", etc., etc., etc. I remember my friend being so obsessed
with "Silence of the Lambs", that it drove me crazy. And I hated the movie
naturally and refused to see it. But everyone told me that I have to see
this, so I let my guard down. And had an open mind, and I'm glad I did. My
friend was right, this is a great movie. It is so well acted, I couldn't
even describe. I loved "Silence of the Lambs" and would recommend it to
anyone. It's creepy and exciting. Trust me, you'll love
it.

10/10

Brilliant Best Picture of 1991 that never gets old.  "The Silence of the
Lambs" deals with a young FBI cadet (Oscar-winner Jodie Foster) who is sent
to interview a captured madman (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the
greatest performances ever on the screen) to find out about a serial killer
(Ted Levine) who is stripping the skin from his female victims after they
die.  The FBI has had no luck with the case and agent Scott Glenn tries to
throw a curve-ball to Hopkins by sending Foster.  Hopkins is a former doctor
of Levine and holds the clues to capturing the unknown criminal.  Needless
to say the film takes many twists and turns, creating a suspenseful thriller
that has no equal.  At the heart of "The Silence of the Lambs" are the
confrontations between Hopkins and Foster.  They play a complicated chess
match of words which results in some of the greatest footage ever captured
for the cinema.  Hopkins dominates in spite of the fact he has approximately
17 minutes of time in the film.  This is a film that will wrap itself around
you and you will likely never be able to shake some of the key elements you
have seen in this amazing masterpiece.  5 stars out of 5. 

<|_=00=_|>
The Silence of the Lambs runs two hours.Anthony Hopkins appears for
little more than sixteen minutes, yet during those minutes he hasn't
bored you for a second, not even after the tenth or eleventh viewing.
Such is the power of his performance, it's absolutely impossible to
forget him.His character, Dr.Hannibal"The Cannibal" Lecter, is a brutal
killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very
intelligent, charismatic and with good taste(you can interpret that as
you like).A clichè by now, but who cares? He still is one of the key
elements in this wonderful thriller, which sees Jodie Foster's Clarice
Starling asking for Lecter's help to catch another killer.The result is
a dangerous yet fascinating relationship between the young,
unexperienced FBI-agent and the convicted,but basically omnipotent,
psychiatrist.He's a step ahead of everyone all the time, and makes sure
everyone notices, with his witty, unforgettable one-liners.If there had
to be only one reason to worship this movie, then it would have to be
the chemistry between the two leading actors.Never before has a
non-sexual man/woman connection been more thrilling.Never before has a
film's ending been more unsettling and brilliant and left us asking for
more.

Best watched with a nice Chianti...

P.S. dear film-buffs, have the lambs stopped screaming?
<|_=00=_|>
I'll never forget my first viewing of this movie at the theater and
will always look back fondly on it for one reason: helping me quit
smoking cigarettes.

I read the book first, was fascinated by it, and couldn't wait for the
film to come out. That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew
this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an
intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this
film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.

Although entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch,
especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer,
"Buffalo Bill." "Bill" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and
profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant.
This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes
involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is
some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other
inmates are held.

Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent "Clarice Starling" and Scott
Glenn is low-key and effective as "Jack Crawford." A major part of the
film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts
"Clarice," while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a
case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.

Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie.
His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is
one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the
sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with
intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.

"Silence Of The Lambs" has turned into a modern-day "classic." If by
some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark,
difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off
other things.
<|_=00=_|>

This is definitely a film that proves you don't need tons of blood and gore
to have a good suspense film.  Anthony Hopkins performance as the deranged
genius Lecter earned him a well deserved Academy Award and the same was true
of Jodie Foster's performance as Clarice Starling.  This film should go down
in history as one of the greatest suspense films in the history of
cinema.
<|_=00=_|>

The Silence of the Lambs, having accomplished the rare feat of winning all
five of the major Academy Award categories, is a remarkable achievement in
filmmaking.  Gruesome, pulpish material was transformed by dedicated
participants on all levels of production, and a film that would have failed
in the hands of many others wound up becoming a modern masterpiece.  Taut
direction and a superb screenplay might be the best arguments for the film's
power, but the flashiest are certainly delivered in the bravura performances
of Hopkins and Foster.  Their interplay -- and remember, they only share a
handful of scenes together -- is nothing short of riveting.

STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little
Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits 

Rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to get
into the mind of notorious incarcerated serial killer Dr Hannibal 'the
Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to get his evaluation on the elusive
Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who's been abducting and killing young
women. When a prominent senator's daughter is kidnapped, it becomes a
race against time to find her before she is killed and all the while
Lecter is playing mind-games with Starling as well as any help he can
provide...

The first of Thomas Harris's Hannibal novels to be adapted for the
screen, only to be followed some years later with some very lacklustre
(but inevitable!) follow-ups, despite it's age this remains one of the
most effective chillers of modern times. Despite the mainstream appeal
of the film, the grainy lighting and laid-back budget give it an
art-house feel that sets it apart from other such films that were as
successful. The film manages some effectively disturbing scenes that
make it a not altogether pleasant viewing experience.

Performances wise, in a very early role, a young Foster shows her
promise for future roles, with a gripping portrayal of naivety and
vulnerability here that is very compelling and convincing, even though
there are some plausibility problems with someone as junior as her
being assigned to do something like that. Hopkins too is brilliant as
Lecter, playing a dangerous man behind bars who's ability to get inside
your head and see the things you don't want him to see makes him no
less dangerous, if not more so, than if he was on the outside. He's
certainly received the most acclaim for his role over the years, but in
my humble opinion, he's actually over-shadowed (though only slightly!)
by Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, a truly extraordinary psychopath with an
unsettling sexuality disorder that is probably one of the nastiest
things ever to be seen in such a mainstream film. As supporting FBI
agent Crawford, Scott Glenn is impressive but sort of just faded into
DTV land after this film.

It's easily one of the most popular films ever made, so it's likely a
lot of you are familiar with it already, but with reviews on the
so-inferior follow-up films Red Dragon and Hannibal, I thought it only
right that I'd finally give this first film a mention. Truly
remarkable. *****
<|_=00=_|>
It is a creepy and taken-by-storm experience with the film, background
music is darker than the film itself and too ominous, plot is
brilliantly constructed, conversations are thought-provocative, to
crown the whole, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkin are the cream. They
take ownership of Clarice and Hannibal respectively, transforming them
into the most unforgettable screen images.

The psychological path of Hannibal is hard to trace. He is so odd a
mixture of intelligence, cruelty, insanity, grace and charisma. In the
depth, fledgling FBI trainee Clarice is no match of him. She is still
naive yet very ambitious. On the trail of the serial killer Buffalo
Bill, she's sent to interview him, a psychiatrist-turned-cannibal.
Hannibal is willing to provide clues to finding the killer but only in
return for personal information about Clarice herself. He calls it Quid
Pro Quo. In those mind games, the two dance backward and forward
between cannibal and FBI agent, mentor and student, psychiatrist and
patient, father and daughter. It is Clarice who breathes life into the
multidimensional sophisticated psychopath and Hannibal who nudges the
aspiring student FBI agent and helps her achieve her first success in a
world of Y chromosome where her guru Crawford uses her, embarrasses
her, excludes her; Doctor Chilton regards her no more than a
simple-minded woman and tries to flirt with her. Frankly speaking,
though no lack of other impressive scenes, it's really the nerves
fights between Hannibal and Clarice that carries the film.

Some of the horrible scenes involve Buffalo Bill who, a transvestite,
skins his victims, especially woman victims. But the most terrifying
one is Clarice's single-handed trace in Buffalo Bill's gruesome den,
which also has become another irony to the self-important
testosterone-dominated world. Crawford's misjudgment and stubbornness
makes him out of the right track, a special anti-terror deployment
resulting in vain. But Clarice, though excluded from the business which
she should be on, still holds onto her intuition and through
on-the-spot investigation finds the serial killer at last. She has to
take on him herself. (Demme uses "deceptive cutting" there to enhance
the tension.) It is definitely a life-or-death fight, especially when
Clarice is in the dark, groping her way in absolute terror. I have no
doubt everyone holds the breath when the film rolls to that part.

A gripping film that well deserved its Oscars
<|_=00=_|>

With Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed recognition for the horror
genre.  It is a first-rate production all around.  It boasts a witty and
suspenseful script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. 
It has marvelous direction from Demme.  Demme creates suspense very well
throughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of
Clarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home.  The two
lead actors won oscars for their performances...each deserved.  Foster is
very good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up
the screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer.  Hopkins
does the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and
yet illicts some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation.  He
says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed.  The
rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a
unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins.  Of course the story of the
other killer is very very chilling as well.  A quality film in all
aspects!
