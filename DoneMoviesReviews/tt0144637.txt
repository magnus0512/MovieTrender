Okay this movie was just plain awful.  The plot is rediculous, The jokes
aren't funny, and as for the acting well, the star of the movie is Joey
Lawrance, enough said.  I did however enjoy this movie because my friends
and I just mocked it so horribally.  Thats really all this movie is good
for. You don't even have to be particularly clever or witty to do this
either, the movie pretty much mocks itself.  I can't imagine how
incredibally boring it would be to watch this movie by
yourself.

It looked like it would be nice watch this as a joke, but even that
made my brain hurt. It's the type of movie that makes you ashamed of
the industry. Just think of all of the starving children that could
have been fed with the money this CRAP used up... The time people
wasted on watching this instead of doing something useful, like,
watching paint dry. Even being drunk probably doesn't make this movie
better (I wouldn't know, I only watched it once sober and am in no way
meaning to do that to myself again). 

I've found that watching this movie was only good for one thing -
whenever one of my friends regards some movie as "the worst movie
ever", I simply raise my hand and say - "Tequila Bodyshots."
<|_=00=_|>

This movie is by far the worst movie ever made. It's scary that someone
looked at this script and said "Hey, this looks like a good movie to
have on my resume." It's sad that some company put forth money for the
production of this movie as well. This movie is so horrible, it made me
vomit. Anyone who thought this was a genuinely good movie is a complete
idiot. This is one of those movies that you rent because you want a
good movie to make fun of with your friends. That is about all it is
good for. Terrible acting, terrible story, terrible setting, terrible
everything. If i could give this movie 2 thumbs down, I would, but I
don't want to waste energy in turning my hand over and extending my
thumb on a movie so utterly disgusting. Joey Lawrence has to be the
worst actor I've ever seen. That is all I have to say.

It almost made me puke and I woke up the next morning needing an aspirin.

I am glad to have learned the following 1) tequila can cure anything, 2)
that body shots can perform miracles, 3)Joey Lawrence is still alive, and
4)
that dreams really can come true in America because apparently anyone will
give anybody a bunch a money to make anything no matter how crappy it
is.

I wish I could have found this somewhat funny but the acting was so bad
and
the story so weak that I just couldn't.  What's sad is that in some ways
this comes off as some sort of after school special regarding the evils of
tequila use or something.  Shame on you Joey Lawrence.

The stupidest f*ckin' film ever. It physically hurts. I can't believe I
actually saw what i did. Someone somewhere got fired for saying yes to
this
unbelievably horrid piece of dung.
i feel like punishing myself for not killing myself 10 minutes into
it.

In fact, I STILL feel bad.

Joey (or now Joesph) Lawrence has been (desperately) looking for a
comeback
movie, but if he keeps making movies like this no one is going to give him
a
shot. It may look a little better than most low budget horror flicks, but
the story is awkardly set up and can be hard to follow at times. I think
the
film had the right idea; supernatural horror mixed with lush romance and a
dash of spice, but the mythology comes off as silly and since this plays
such a big role in the film, it ruins the rest.
<|_=00=_|>

uh.. i wasted 90 minutes already so i will be concise...

ACTING: TERRIBLE
SCRIPT: WORSE
STORY: POINTLESS AND IDIOTIC

it is bad very bad, who makes this stuff?

Upon reading the other user comments about this film, I am left to wonder
if
any of them actually WATCHED the movie. Or maybe there's some other
mysterious movie with the same name that was actually good. But I
digress...

This film, if you were to call it that, is atrocious in all areas. The
acting is forced and wooden, the directing is confused at best, and
absolutely nothing is cohesive and sensical. Perhaps my least favorite
facet, though, was the writing. The diologue was strained and
unnatural.

All of that being said, I will give this film the benefit of the doubt...
it's really great to watch and make fun of with your friends. Still, this
movie gets only a 1/10, only getting the one because of how funny it is to
watch.

If this movie even tried to take itself seriously, it would be a train
wreck.  But it doesn't, and because of that, it's fun.  The plot is
loose,
there's a bunch of badly developed characters, but who cares?  It's
completely fun, it has a completely wacky style to it, and it's well
presented. Go ahead and enjoy it...there's way worse cinema out
there.

While "Tequila Body Shots" ranks in my personal top five worst movies ever
made, it is definitely memorable.  A film so wretched Jim Varney would
have
winced, it raises the question "who gave this tripe the greenlight?"  That
being said, it was impossible for me to turn away.  I caught the movie
inadvertently on cable and could do nothing but follow it through to its
bitter end.  The effects, the acting, the final denouement involving the
movie's namesake all coalesce to make a cinematic masterpiece in shame.
Joey Lawrence has grown up, and after doing that movie should have thrown
up.  Worth watching just to realize that every other movie you thought was
bad actually wasn't THAT bad.
