Personally I had a very good time watching this movie, but it seems
like I'm one of the few. I don't know why, but the voters on this
website always seem to hate comedies if they aren't from the hand of
some cult-director. Does a movie always have to be a great drama or an
exciting thriller? Not if you ask me, but I'm only one of many over
here of course.

It's true, the movie is a little chaotic from time to time. It isn't an
overproduced Hollywood movie that takes itself too serious and that's
exactly where its charm is in it for me. I loved to see Brad Pitt as
the clumsy criminal who always is able to do something wrong. The same
for Julia Roberts as his hysterical girlfriend and James Gandolfini as
the gay hit man who has kidnapped her. 

I know, it's not done to say that you liked to see Julia Roberts play a
certain role and Brad Pitt can never be good as a comical actor...
Well, perhaps it is time for some people to broaden their minds. Don't
believe what everybody says, watch it for yourself and form your own
opinion. I liked it and I give it an 8/10.

I'm genuinely surprised at the number of people who disliked this
movie. Perhaps because it was a bit disjointed, chaotic, uneven,
unpredictable and even incoherent at times. And that's just why I loved
it. It's life. Yes, it's the crazy, seedy, shady lives of these people
(the main characters being Pitt's and Roberts' characters), but at
least it's honest... and darned funny. I thought the self-deprecating
jabs at how most Gringos view Mexico/Mexicans were priceless. Raul!!
The grainy flashbacks had my sides splitting.

People, this is a classic melodrama told in today's yucky, dirty,
gritty, ugly times. A beautiful (if you look closely) story that
doesn't take it self seriously at all. This is anything but formula
Hollywood hype. It is a genius inside-joke that sandbagged most of the
people hoping to come out and see a Pitt/Roberts version of Sleeping in
Seattle or some similar chick-flick dreck.

When is enough enough? Never.

	A couple working on the give-and-take aspects of their relationship, an
exquisitely crafted antique pistol with something of a diverse history and
some questions concerning who is working for whom, all figure prominently in
`The Mexican,' a black comedy directed by Gore Verbinski and starring Julia
Roberts and Brad Pitt.  Jerry Welbach (Pitt), a somewhat less than astute
young fellow in thrall to a criminal currently incarcerated, is given a
seemingly simply assignment:  He is to go to Mexico, where he will
rendezvous at a bar in a small town, at which time he will take possession
of an invaluable hand-made pistol; he will then transport the item to the
States and deliver it to his boss.  But there's a problem; his girlfriend,
Samantha (Roberts) expects to go to Las Vegas at the same time, and their
plans were already made and set in stone.  So what is a guy to do?  After
Sam throws him out of their apartment and Jerry tries to explain-- in a
memorable scene with her on the second story balcony, he on the ground
looking up-- that if he doesn't do this job they will, well, KILL him, it
doesn't make any difference.  After all, their trip to Vegas had already
been planned, and he promised it would happen.  Talk about a guy between a
rock and a hard place.  And it's only the beginning of a dark comedy of
errors and circumstances that ultimately involves them with some double
dealings and brings them into contact with a psychotic killer named Leroy
(James Gandolfini).
	Director Verbinski lends a nice touch to the movie, eliciting noteworthy
performances from his actors and establishing early on his method of using
specific landmarks-- a traffic signal and a cross-roads in the middle of
nowhere, for example-- that give context and definition to what is
happening, sometimes off-screen (as in the opening scene, when you only
`hear' a traffic accident that becomes a pivotal part of the story).  He
avoids slapstick and plays up the natural, subtle humor that drives the
film.  The characters are well drawn and the dialogue is clever and witty
(`You Â‘Forrest Gumped' your way through this...') and often very droll.  And
he maintains a pace and develops an atmosphere in which the unexpected can
be expected that keeps it all moving along nicely and right on track.  And
there's a politically incorrect sensibility to the movie that is refreshing
to see; in real life certain situations and cultures that are foreign to us
are often viewed in stereotypical terms, so there is no reason to portray it
otherwise in a film, especially when care has been taken to present it in an
inoffensive manner, as it is here.        
	Taking on a decidedly unglamorous role, Roberts nevertheless creates a
lively character with Sam, imbuing her with plenty of spunk and, of course,
that trademark smile.  It's not a part that calls for a lot of depth, but
she makes Sam likable and fun to watch, and she makes her banter with Jerry
and Leroy credible and engaging.  Credit goes to Pitt, as well, for making
the most of what is actually a leading man/character role; Jerry isn't the
sharpest tool in the shed and he may be easily distracted, but-- like Sam--
he's not without some natural charm that makes him quite personable and
interesting.  And there is a chemistry between the two that makes their
relationship believable, especially when the sparks are flying.  Gandolfini,
meanwhile, not to be outdone by his charismatic co-stars, makes an indelible
mark as the sensitive, psychotic killer who turns out to be something of an
enigma.
	The supporting cast includes Bob Balaban (Nalin), David Krumholtz (Beck),
Luis Felipe Tovar (Luis) and Gene Hackman (Margolis).  A lively romp that
takes some unexpected turns, `The Mexican' has a dark side, but manages to
remain uplifting and thoroughly entertaining.  There's a natural flow to the
film and the laughs, generated by both the situations and the characters,
are never forced but prompted, rather, by the spontaneity of it all.  It's a
movie that never pretends to be anything other than what it is, which is
pure entertainment.  It'll leave you with a smile on your face, some
chuckles and some great lines to quote.  And that, my friends, is the magic
of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.

THE MEXICAN / (2001) *** (out of four

The title of Gore Verbinski's new romantic comedy adventure refers to the
name of an extraordinarily valuable but cursed pistol possessed by a young
man living in urban Mexico. Brad Pitt stars as Jerry Welbach, an errand
boy
forced to work for a local mob boss (Bob Balanban) after accidentally
causing a powerful kingpin named Margolis (Gene Hackman) to be sent to
jail.
His "last" job is to go to Mexico and retrieve "The Mexican" and its
beholder. Jerry's spiteful girlfriend, Samantha (Julia Roberts), wants
Jerry
to keep his promise about traveling to Las Vegas with her, but she does
not
realize that he can either accomplish this task or be killed. Since
Samantha
is such an understanding lover, she packs her bags and heads to Vegas
alone,
dumping her "selfish" long time boyfriend. Unfortunately for her, she is
in
the middle of a complicated situation whether she likes it or not. While
traveling to her destination, Samantha is almost killed by a hitman
(Sherman
Augustus), but saved by another cold-blooded killer named Leroy (James
Gandolfini), who has been assigned to kidnap her just in case Jerry gets
any
deceptive ideas while on his journey.

Once in Mexico, Jerry locates the person and the pistol, but things go
terribly wrong when the man is accidentally killed and several locals
steal
his transportation. Becoming suspicious, Jerry's accomplice, Ted (J.K.
Simmons), is sent to find Jerry and declare the rising stakes at hand.
Meanwhile, Samantha and Leroy become emotionally candid and share useful
information of their past experiences involving love. While Leroy is a
homosexual, he still lusts for romantic fulfillment, as the sentimental
killer gives Samantha some advice of her own.

"The Mexican" is not really a romantic comedy like many audiences will
expect; it is a somewhat coarse, violent adventure with undertones dealing
with forgiveness and the strength of love. Actually, the relationship
between the characters of Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts is quite trite.
Except
for the third act, whenever on screen together, the two characters do
nothing but bitterly argue and fight. The performances keep the romance
alive; clearly Pitt and Roberts are the right choices for the parts. Brad
Pitt progresses into a somewhat comedic role, and he often struggles with
it. But I certainly thought his performance was funny. He gives his
character the perfect amount of charm and sweetness. Julia Roberts is a
little annoying but puts an effective edge in her character. We actually
end
up caring about both of their fates.

There are a lot of little things to like in "The Mexican" like the scenes
in a Mexican bar, shuttered with a dark atmosphere and authentic
cinematography by Dariusz Wolski; dim lights give the rooms a greenish
tint,
creating a realistic and believable mood for the scenes. The soundtrack
furnishes the movie with a genuine zest. A lot of the dialogue is witty
and
smart, with scenes that are well-written, often funny, and keep our
attention. The comedic elements keep the movie interesting and fresh. The
film does an excellent job with informing us about the history of the
pistol
and the plot's complications are curiously intriguing. Leroy's
homosexuality
introduces relationship issues that give his character depth. Although
often
bloody and shockingly profane, "The Mexican" is not mean-spirited or
nasty-but enlightening and whimsical.

The film is directed by Gore Verbinski, who also provided us with
fast-paced entertainment in the 1997 family comedy "MouseHunt." "The
Mexican" is much different from that film, but still has the energy and
stride to keep us engrossed. Although not what many people will expect, I
found "The Mexican" to be a surprising delight.

<|_=00=_|>

Pitt and Roberts were a good match, and James Gandolfini really was the best
part of this movie.  A young man (Pitt) has to go to Mexico and retrieve an
antique pistol for a mobster, much to the chagrin of his girlfriend
(Roberts).  Pitt encounters a lot of snags and hang ups trying to complete
the task, and unknowingly, his girlfriend is being held as insurance until
he finishes the job.  Worth seeing!  B+
<|_=00=_|>

Okay, I admit it. I'm a Julia fan. But before I saw this movie I'd heard so
much about it being terrible that I had incredibly low expectations - so I
guess I was going in to see it from a different angle to most people.

I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I actually saw 'Mouse Hunt' or
whatever it's called once on TV, didn't think too much of it, and I was
hoping that 'The Mexican' would be different. Luckily, it
was.

Brad Pitt gives a sweet performance as Jerry, the accident prone hero, but
the best part of the movie is the chemistry between Julia Roberts as Sam and
James Gandolfini as Leroy - an unlikely relationship between a kidnapper and
a kidnappee (is that a word?). 

I'd advise people to see this movie with an open mind. If you expect
miracles you'll probably be disappointed. But I actually did really like
it.

Oh, and it made me cry. Four times. How embarrassing is that? Maybe I'm
getting my period or something.
<|_=00=_|>
Take "All About Steve" (cute dysfunctional romcom), toss in "3 Days in
the Valley" (gritty crime drama), a little bit of "Silver Streak"
(roadcom) and a hint of "Deathtrap" or possibly "Fargo" (dark comedy),
then whip them all mercilessly with an eggbeater until it's
unrecognizable, bake at 425 degrees for 2 hrs 3 mins, and there you
have "The Mexican".

If you enjoyed all the films I mentioned above, you'll like this. It's
polished, as any Hollywood flick with Brad Pitt & Julia Roberts would
be, but it's quirky and odd enough to set itself apart from the others.
The story is about a lovable loser (Brad Pitt) and his crazy
therapy-inducing girlfriend (Julia Roberts) who end up trapped in a
bloody battle to get a cursed gun known as "The Mexican". The plot has
plenty of twists & turns to keep you entertained on the surface. But
the real story is about unlikely relationships: not just Brad & Julia's
bipolar romance but also unlikely friendships & loyalties that spring
up between kidnappers & kidnappees, assassins & victims, American
profiteers & Mexican defenders... like a good Clint Eastwood movie
("The Unforgiven", "Gran Turino"), the point is that it's easy to apply
labels, but how often do you get a good look at what's underneath?

I mentioned that this is a dark comedy, and indeed there are about half
a dozen killings. What makes it different from, say Pulp Fiction or
Heathers, is that the film doesn't gloss over the deaths with comedic
gags. That's where this film is unusual... It has a place for comedy,
and it has a place for tragedy. It doesn't really mix the two. Thus you
may find your emotions wrenched around a bit, and that may be
disorienting to some viewers. But if you're ready for a wild ride
(exactly what this movie claims to be), you'll love it. And it has a
cool dog in it too.

Other good movies in the same genre include "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" (Brad
Pitt & Angelina Jolie), the hilarious "My Cousin Vinny" (Joe Pesci,
Marisa Tomei) and the classic "Foul Play" (Chevy Chase & Goldie Hawn).
<|_=00=_|>

Being quite a harsh critic myself, I was surprised to see how badly recieved
this film was. Admittably the film tended to drag a little length and was
missing something to make it a little more entertaining.

But the film has some interesting characters, situations, and scenery to
make this film highly watchable. Pitt and Roberts are good, but have put in
much better performances elsewhere. And spend the majority of the film
apart. 
I suspect the main criticisms of this film are mainly to do with high
expectations: in having Pitt, Roberts and the Sopranos guy
in.
      But in summary, an alright film - but nothing special.
<|_=00=_|>

I can see how some people wouldn't like the movie.  It didn't have alot to
say about the world.  It didn't inspire you to go out and do great things.
It wasn't even extremely funny.  but I still liked it.  I have become
accustomed to Hollywood, and their mindless stupid little movies.  At least
this one had better cinematography. Perhaps it was a bit overcast, and
although it might seem like the typical teenager flick actor would fit the
part better, that would have turned the movie into just another money
making
teeny bopper disaster.  But as it is the two biggest stars in HOllywood
made
this movie, and that alone made it a pretty interesting movie.  I'm one of
those people who like Julia Roberts.  I have heard many complaints about
her
as an actress, but she still tops my list of favorites.  SO maybe I'm a bit
biased towards the film, but i still thoroughly enjoyed it.

<|_=00=_|>

I didn't expect much of this film and was pleasantly surprised at how good
it was. Well written (despite what others here have said), well directed
(except for the pace which got slow), well acted (both Roberts and Pitt were
believable and very funny, and Gandolfini was funny and touching). The
criticism of Pitt, Roberts and Gandolfini is especially perplexing, as they
were all in top form.

So why all the complaints? I don't get it. Yes, it was 10-15 minutes too
long. Yes, it changed tone somewhat drastically near the end. But overall it
was surprising, very funny, interesting to look at and
fun.
