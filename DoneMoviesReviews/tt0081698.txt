I distinctly remember this movie because in the summer of 1980 I was
travelling across the United States, and only had time to see one movie of
the three big budgeted comedies that hit the theatres that
year.

The comedies that year were; 1) "Airplane," 2) "Used Cars" and 3) "How to
beat the High Cost of Living."  I went and saw film 3, and have regretted
not seeing "Used Cars" in the theatre to this day.  Some four or five years
later when it hit Home Box Office (HBO) I thought I'd die laughing, and was
kicking myself even harder for not seeing Robert Zemeckis' film in the
theatre some five years before!

"Airplane" took the box office that summer with all of its cheap gags, and
"How to Beat the High Cost of Living" spawned the popular "Kate and Ally" TV
series.  Unfortunately "Used Cars" faded into the background, but saw a well
earned and much deserved revival courtesy an HBO airing and home video
sales.

"Used Cars" is the comedy those two other films wanted to be, but couldn't. 
"Used Cars" is a better film with funnier material, better story, more
action, and more heart, and will always be remembered as the quintessential
1980's comedy.

You must see "Used Cars," but be cautioned, it's NOT a family comedy. 
There's lots of swearing, a few strippers, and other "adult" references. 
Even so, in my personal opinion, it is the funniest film made to date. 
ENJOY! :-)

One of the funniest movies ever made.  I remember watching it on video in
the early '80s and expected something really bad (from the cover on the
video cassette).  There was a movie released around the same time called
GAS, which was awful, awful, awful.  I saw Used Cars after GAS and
expected
the worst.  And Used Cars is STILL as funny as ever.  Perhaps even funnier
now (and interesting to note that Kurt Russell really displays great comic
timing in this, and it is director Robert Zemeckis' only R-rated film).
Zemeckis was one naughty school boy with this film, and those expecting
something along the order of Forrest Gump, Back to the Future or Castaway
will be in for a surprise!
If you're a fan, get the DVD - the commentary with Russell and Zemeckis
and
screenwriter Bob Gale is priceless.  I think they were drinking a little
when they did the commentary.  It is one of the most entertaining
commentaries I have heard.

A classic in bad taste, in the best Mel Brooks and Farrelly Brothers
fashion--and 50 bucks never killed anyone!
<|_=00=_|>

This is a romantic comedy, but not one I would watch with my wife! 

The tasteless jokes and one-liners roll out almost non-stop. 

The movie verifies most everything we believe about used car salesmen, the
"My boss will have a heart Attack" sales scene nearly brings me to tears I
laugh so hard.  
Russell is at his best with some of the best character actors around joining
in, I especially like the goofy Lenny and Squiggy, they just play two very
disturbed individuals.  
Don't look for any deep meaning here, just crude humor a a very funny movie.

I give it 8/10

******************SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!******************************

There are not many American films made any more which are as inherently
cynical and as satirical as this. I know Rudy gives up his chance of
becoming Senator to help Barbara but the last image we see is him
giving the spiel to an old woman. The makers knew they wouldn't be able
to get away with making a film which didn't have some sort of phoney
closure so they stuck in the big finale, but they mean for us to be
aware of Rudy's true identity; once a hustler, always a hustler.

It is also incredibly funny, packed with incidental pleasures as well
as the foregrounded plot. In many ways the film could have been
improved if they had just concentrated on the machinations of the rival
dealerships but I think the film did need something more concrete to
hang the narrative on. The last half an hour is a little disappointing
but given that the preceding hour and a bit was so good, one can
forgive them this.

There are so many things to mention I think I'll just list a few: Toby
the dog, the two guerilla broadcasters, Rudy's first commercial, Jeff
conning a customer into thinking he has killed the dog. There are so
many great moments I can't think why this film isn't better known than
it is.
<|_=00=_|>
Kurt Russell is Rudy Russo a slimy, dishonest used car salesman working
for Luke Fuchs (Jack Warden) who yearns to be in Congress, where the
real payola is. When Luke dies from one of the schemes of his evil
brother, Roy (Jack Warden again pulling double duty, who owns his own
used car lot across the street) to get Luke's car lot, as his is going
to be bulldozed to make room for a new offramp. It's up to Rudy to hide
Luke's death from both Roy and Luke's daughter, Barbara (Deborah
Harmon), whom Rudy is falling for despite himself. This movie is one of
Robert Zemeckis's best films (right up there with the first "Back to
the Future"), but whereas that's more or less a kid's fantasy, however
great it might be. This is a true blue adult comedy that wears it's R
rating on it's sleeve. And is all the more hilarious for it. Filled
with a great many quotable lines, memorable scenes, and wonderfully
zany characters, it's no wonder that I love it so much.

My Grade: B+ 

DVD Extras: Commentary by Robert Zemeckis, Kurt Russell, and Bob Gale;
Outtakes; TV spot; 8 Radio spots; Advertising Gallery; filmagraphies;
and Trailers for "So I Married an Axe Murderer", "Multiplicity" and
"Groundhog Day" 

Eye Candy: Deborah Harmon and Cheryl Rixon each get topless

This is one funny movie.  Kurt Russell shows his comedic side and is
hysterical - so are Gerrit Graham and Jack Warden.  Robert Zemeckis made a
gem very few people saw and this is my favorite movie of his.  See it if
you
want to laugh like hell.
<|_=00=_|>

first of all when this movie came out, in 1980, (when first i saw
it)
was way before cell phones, personal computers, and the
saturation
of mtv, which all have jaded our youth of today. this was a comedy
years ahead of it's time..that said. kurt russell's character
assassination of a used car salesman is a direct hit. gerrit graham's
performance is extremely brilliant as a superstitious-gambling
fanatic,
really the whole cast is incredibly funny. but it's the dual
performance
of jack warden playing twin bothers, with good and evil
inclinations,
that probably should of won him a golden globe (on that performance
alone)
he's that good...simply put, this movie is laughs,laughs, split your
pants
laughs, and more laughs. a must watch comedy. and after you've seen it
you'll want to add it to your movie library. but if you somehow don't
find
this movie funny, then maybe you need to check your sense of humor at the
door...


<|_=00=_|>
You've read the reviews and summations on other posts, but when you
watch this gem, be sure to pay close attention to the scene where Rudy
and the other 'salesmen' are ready to start selling on the morning
after their football break-in commercial. The way Rudy goes from being
"Rudy O'hara" to "Rudy Garcia" to "Rudy Washington Carver" is sheer
script genius. And when Jeff uses his shotgun to blast away high
prices, ending by saying "We blew the s---out of that overpriced
m-----F-----just like we blow the s---out of all high prices", if
you're not laughing you must be deaf and blind. There are many other
great scenes too. I rate this film 9 out of 10 (only because of the
slight letdown in the last 20 minutes).
<|_=00=_|>

It is absolutely absurd that this flick was left off "AFI's Top 100
Funniest Movies of All Time." While it loses some steam (and
irreverence} in the last twenty minutes,the first two thirds of the
movie is consistently hilarious. The omission may have occurred because
female members of the voting panel found the movie offensive. Indeed,
the main male characters manipulate and exploit women throughout. In
truth, the used car salesmen manipulate all the men they encounter too
(although they don't use their tits to sell cars).

I encourage you men to view this gem with your female significant other
even though it's not a "chick flick" like "When Harry Met Sally." If
she hates it, dump her for a woman with a sense of humor.

USED CARS was director Robert Zemeckis' follow-up to the sweet, sentimental
I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND, and, as he joked in his audio commentary, he wanted
to cut loose, swear, and do something supremely tasteless as a follow-up. He
succeeded magnificently!

This is a wild tribute to corruption, deceit, and dishonesty, in a field
second only to politics in tarnished reputations! Kurt Russell is the
crooked head salesman in a broken-down car lot, saving money to buy a seat
in Congress "where the really BIG kickback money is". His boss,
sweet-natured Luke Fuchs (Jack Warden), has a bad heart and a twin brother,
truly nasty Roy Fuchs (also Warden, who is wonderful in the dual roles)
running a competing used car lot across the highway. Evil Fuchs NEEDS his
brother's dealership, as a state highway is about to be built over his lot,
so he has an employee pose as a customer, and 'try out' one of Luke's cars
with the old man in the car. After the test drive from Hell, Luke stumbles
inside his trailer, and dies from a heart attack. 

Russell realizes any hope to raise enough cash to run for office would be
shattered with Fuchs' death, so he and his fellow employees bury the old man
and his car in the lot, and fibs that Fuchs had left town on vacation. Then
Fuchs' daughter, Barbara (Deborah Harmon) arrives, and things get
sticky!

The film becomes a live-action Warner Bros. cartoon, as 'good guy' Russell
and 'bad guy' Warden try scheme after scheme to ruin the other...Warden
offers a carnival in his lot, Russell offers strippers...Warden does TV
commercials, Russell brings in two disreputable cable guys ('Lenny and
Squiggy' Michael McKean and David L. Lander) to break into a Presidential
address with an 'R'-rated ad that would leave the FCC in apoplexy! This
insanity builds to an epic climax, as hundreds of junkyard cars, driven by
Driver's Ed students, race to fill Russell's car lot, and prevent a
court-ruled closing.

The cast is matchless; in addition to Russell, Warden, and Harmon,
outrageous humor is provided by Gerrit Graham (who gleefully shotguns
Warden's cars in another 'illegal' TV spot), and Frank McRae, as a mechanic
you DON'T want to disagree with. And don't forget a certain dog, who
outperforms nearly everyone in the cast! 

This is the ONLY 'R'-rated film Zemeckis has ever directed (the BACK TO THE
FUTURE trilogy and FORREST GUMP are among his later triumphs), yet USED CARS
was a commercial failure when first released, despite rave reviews.
AIRPLANE! came out at the same time, and, unfortunately, the public wasn't
interested in watching TWO 'over-the-top' comedies. So USED CARS languished,
until video and dvd reintroduced it to a new generation.

It's growing status a a cult classic is perhaps the BEST proof the "Crime
Pays" in USED CARS!
