Dumb laughs are easy to come by.  Dumb characters are even easier.  But when
you get a movie that is so endearingly, goofily dumb as "Baby's day Out",
you can't help but love it!

The plot is straight out of Cartoon Land, with a low bow in the Three
Stooges' direction compliments of scripter John Hughes (surprise!).  Three
of the dimmest kidnappers in history (Mantegna, Pantoliano and Haley) make
the mistake of kidnapping a rich couple's little baby, who turns out to be
far more resourceful than all three of them combined.  And a lot more
ruthless.

During the course of the day, baby Bink (Warton and Warton) leads the dumb
bad guys throughout the width and breadth of Chicago and leaves them all
bruised, beaten, burnt, plummeted from innumerable high drops and otherwise
humiliated ("we've had the living hell torn out of us by a baby," screams
Mantegna at one point).  And all the while, we're laughing.

I saw this in the theatre when it first came out and, I must admit, the
entire packed-in audience was laughing hysterically at every single
pratfall, gag and slapstick business that occurred.  I love this kind of
movie and seeing the great Joe Mantegna take his lumps so valiantly brings a
smile in itself.

It's nice to play dumb once in a while.  And even nicer to witness
it.

Eight stars for "Baby's Day Out".  If you like such laughs, it'll make your
"Day".

This movie is worth checking out. Even though it's predictable, the events
that happen as this movie unfolds are funny as hell. Especially the part
when Eddie has the baby in his lap under his coat and the police are
asking
him whether or not he has seen any babies today. The baby lights Eddie's
lighter - - the rest you'll have to see to believe. I rated this 10 out of
10 stars, and I agree with the first person who said "Drink your bottle of
milk and enjoy this predictable film," because that's exactly what you
should do. Don't take it seriously or else you'll miss the
point.

Credibility-wise, this is one of the most ludicrous movies you'll ever
see, but it's fun and I would think almost anyone would enjoy it. It's
basically "Home Alone" out on the streets and with a baby instead of a
small boy.

A baby goes wandering all over the big city with two kidnappers chasing
it. People are everywhere but nobody sees the baby but the bad guys?!
Hey, I told you it made no sense, but there are so many laughs in here,
so many goofy slapstick routines that work that it's worth your time to
check it out. I've seen it a couple of times and throughly enjoyed it
each time, as have my guests - from kids to older folks.

To movie buffs, it's kind of fun also to see Joe Pantoliano and Joe
Mantegna playing roles in which profanity is at a minimum, and they are
in it only for laughs. It's a long way from most of their roles.
Mantegna is especially impressive with his comedy. I was shocked how
funny he was.

The only criticism I had, other than totally preposterous story being a
little too far-fetched, is that one scene (at the construction site)
went on too long. The movie as a whole would have been better had it
been cut about 15 minutes. It's basically a one-joke movie and 99
minutes is too long for that.

Overall, this is a nice entertainment with a lot of laugh-out-loud
scenes. If you get a kick out of seeing a baby constantly laugh, giggle
and have a great time, then you'll really love this.

Great film in my opinion.  Baby Bink is unbelieveably cute.  With his
dimples, playfulness, and giggle, it is hard to believe why it bombed.  I
think it deserves major props for being kid-friendly, instead of the
hard-core things people are used to seeing.  It is great for all- ages, a
10
out of 10, spectacular!

...but I really love this movie! It's a pity this was released on the
coattails of "Home Alone", since it's inevitably perceived as a
knock-off. But the comparison is really unfair. "Home Alone" featured
McCauley Culkin as annoying, precocious, and self-sufficient far beyond
his years. The criminals who were his foils were reminiscent of The
Three Stooges in their ineptitude. The one quality both Culkin and the
criminals shared was a being mean spirited to some degree.

Baby Bink in "Baby's Day Out" is a true innocent who survives on luck
while remaining adorably unaffected. His criminal foils are more
reminiscent of Laurel & Hardy than The Three Stooges - cleverer and
more subtle. In this case, the quality shared by Baby Bink and the
criminals is innocence and an underlying decency.

The supporting cast is superb, led by Joe Mantegna in one of his best
comic roles.

If you're not too jaded to appreciate it, I highly recommend this
movie.

This is one of those films that should be watched when ever your
feeling really down. I have found it impossible to not laugh and
then feel better while watching this film.
You can't take this film seriously however. It's as if a Warner
Brothers cartoon was brought to life. So, you have to suspend your
disbelief and just enjoy Joe Mantegna and his hapless lackies.
Joe does a great job with character. 
Please, if you watch this film and don't like it; write me, and let me
know why you didn't like it. I like to know.

Despite being the heir to a small fortune Baby Bink has never had his
picture in the paper like other rich babies.  However his mother hires a
famous photographer to take his picture.  However when the photographers
arrive they are actually kidnappers who steal away baby Bink and demand a
ransom.  However Baby Bink manages to slip out of their sight and begins a
journey through the city of his story book.  The kidnappers try to catch him
but seem to be always one step behind.

John Hughes won't be remembered in the same way as Â‘great' filmmakers will
be - but like it or not, he knows how to do this type of film with his eyes
closed.  This never gets above the same cartoon humour of Home Alone, but it
still manages to be very funny.  The story is daft - the baby going through
the city by recognising things from his story book, however the cartoon
humour is very good throughout.  Some scenes (with the worried mother) and
the ending can't help but lapse into sentiment, but for the most part it's
sheer comedy antics.

The reason the comedy works is not due to the baby - he is cute but he never
dominates the way Mulcaly Culkin did, instead he haplessly crawls his way
around using `baby luck'.  What makes it work are three really funny
performances from the kidnappers.  One of my favourite actors Joe Mantegna
is usually above this type of stuff, but he's really funny here.  Similarly
Joe Pantoliano has been in his share of blockbusters and is funny here with
Haley.  The support cast has it's fair share of famous faces - Boyle is
lumbered with all the emotional scenes and Matthew Glave (The Wedding
Singer) doesn't have much to do.  An uncredited Mike Starr as an informant,
Fred Dalton Thompson as the cop, Cynthia Nixon (Sex and the City) as the
nanny and Anna Levine (Bad Boys, Unforgiven, The Crow) as an understanding
mother make interesting appearances.  However when the kidnappers are off
the screen things aren't as good and start to drag.

Overall you know what to expect from this.  If you're in the mood for Tom &
Jerry style cartoon humour (as opposed to Jerry & Tom humour - Mantegna fans
will understand!) then this is a really good laugh.  Simple, unmemorable but
fun!

I saw this movie five years ago and thought it was funny and then
watched it again yesterday (23rd April 2006) and i think i laughed even
harder! So i give this film a full 10, cause i believe it deserves to
be a lot higher than 4 out of 10! It is another classic from the same
mind of the creator of home alone, which by the way is another great
movie. I know that this movie is aimed at children, but the acting from
the three main characters that kidnap the baby is funny! And just to
here that one line to the fat lady, "Give her a sandwich", puts me in
stitches of laughter every time. So watch it and enjoy it as much as i
did!

Baby's Day out is pure fun. If you like movies where young children outwit
stupid grown-ups then this is the movie for you.

Joe Mantegna performs wonderfully as the leader of a trio of kidnappers who
kidnap Baby Bink but soon find him causing more trouble than they can
handle. If you liked films such as Home Alone then this movie will suit
you.

There are wonderful scenes throughout. Baby Bink escapes his captors and
starts crawling round the city and oddly, not one single adult seems to
think this is out of the ordinary. The fun is seeing the blundering trio try
to recapture him. There are some great moments, particularly when Baby Bink
ends up in the gorilla cage at the zoo and when the trio arouse the
suspicions of a policeman and Joe Mantegna hides Bink under a coat on his
lap. 

Whilst children will really enjoy this movie, adults will also get a kick
out of it. Worth viewing if you can.

Its simply one of the best movies I have watched. Superbly created
movie about a child who tackle 3 bad guys(with god always being on his
side) who tried to kidnap him. Very cute kid, funniest scenes and
non-stop comedy make this one as great movie. Its difficult to believe
that how a child can be made to act like the way one did in this movie.
The things simply happens with him. He no where seems to be working in
a movie. And this is a great thing to watch.

In the last child is shown watching a book called "Baby's trip to
China". I am eagerly waiting for any such sequel of the movie.

Good work and a must watch.
