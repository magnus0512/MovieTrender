News reaches Zion of an army of sentinels amassing on the surface many miles
above the city, clearly preparing for an invasion.  While the city prepares
for a counter attack on the sentinels, Morpheus pins his hopes on Neo and
obeys orders to stay with broadcast range to allow Neo to meet with the
Oracle.  Neo meanwhile is plagued with dreams of Trinty's death in the
matrix.  When the Oracle does contact Neo, she tells him of The KeyMaker 
the man who can get him access to the very source of the matrix.  A rescue
mission is mounted which is complicated by not only the agents, but rogue
programmes and the return of a `freed' Agent Smith.

Many reviews (here and in the press) have tended to go one way or the other.
 Some have lavished praise on this film claiming it as a milestone and even
better than the original, others have hated it and laid into it heavily. 
I'm not wanting to sit on the fence but I do feel that both camps have valid
points and that the answer is somewhere in the middle.  The main reason I
found it hard to get into this film was the heavy tone it has now developed.
 Seemingly the same bug that the Star Wars movies have caught (taking
themselves too seriously) the matrix appears in danger of getting in a bad
way.  The plot here is quite straightforward and not as twisty as the
original  however it is delivered as if every line of dialogue was
profound.  This really sucks the life out of the film as it is not profound
but rather borders on the pretentious at times due to it's
delivery.

I suspect that this was spotted and so the film is unnecessarily cluttered
with minor characters that detract from the central tale.  And so screen
time is given to Link and his wife as well as a seemingly pointless speech
from Merovingian.  This makes it feel baggy and also slightly unsatisfactory
when these strands appear to go nowhere but only fill time.  Also the plot
is a little too complex (all this rogue programme stuff) and isn't delivered
in a user friendly way  it is not always clear what the significance of
certain things are until later in the film and even then it is uneven. 
However both these criticisms will be countered if, in Revolutions, these
strands are brought together and minor characters in Reloaded are shown to
have a bigger input.

On the plus side the action is very good.  I must admit that it wasn't as
exciting as the original mainly because the plot wasn't as involving to me 
I need a good story generally to get into the action side.  However in
honesty the action still looks great and is a real leap forward from the
Matrix  a great blend of wire work and visual effects.  Occasionally the
special effects are slightly wanting (in Neo's fight with Agent Smiths it is
clear when it is a visual effect rather than the real thing) but these are
minor quibbles compared to some sterling work.  The car chase on the freeway
may be a very easy way to get an action scene but it still works very well
and is exciting.  The only downside to it is that I felt that an action
scene should have been part of the end of the film  instead the `big' scene
occurs a good 20 minutes before the end of the film.  The actual
cliff-hanger itself doesn't really work and it could have done better with a
general downbeat ending like Empire Strikes back had  did it think I needed
a reason to watch part 3?  I'm already there!

The acting suffers from the same problems as the plot  it is all too heavy.
 The clearest way this is seen is in Fishburne.  In part 1 he was very good,
especially when he exposed Neo to the matrix with a mix of playful wit and
serious touches when they were needed.  Here in part 2 he seems to be
mistaken that he is playing Othello again.  Watch him speaking to the crowds
at Zion, he really plays it like he is playing Moses or something.  In fact
all through the film he is very heavy  even compare his big fight with his
previous face-off with Smith in part 1, there he was human and vulnerable
here he is more like a rock and less fun for it. Moss is also serious but
she was in part 1 too so it's not so noticeable.  Reeves is good and at
least adds some humour but he plays it very serious again.  The additions
add colour but are mostly distractions.  The support cast in part 1 were
merely there, here the film feels it has to develop them to make a rich
tapestry but the end result is it feeling too stretched.  It's hard not to
watch Pinkett-Smith and feel that her character is more to do with the video
game than the film itself.  Happily Hugo Weaving is fun and is back with his
old sneer, while the twins are good value despite having minimal plot
impact.

Overall it was always going to be hard to follow up the first film.  There
the plot was gripping and it is difficult to make the growth of Neo's powers
as interesting as his discovery of them was.  I enjoyed the film but just
felt that the almost biblical significance that it tries to give itself was
it's undoing  luckily the action and style was it's salvation.  Hopefully I
will watch Revolutions and see how Reloaded works better in hindsight. 
Without that knowledge, many of the plot strands appear to be left loose. If
I watched this as a film by itself then it would be irritating  if the
conclusion to the trilogy can get back to the enjoyment and tone and
spectacle of the matrix at it's best then this will be a much better film in
company of it's brothers.  Far from perfect but I don't see how anyone can
totally write this film off.
<|_=00=_|>
The Matrix Reloaded has everything you could possibly want from a
summer blockbuster but it like its predecessor has a heck of a lot more
and while Reloaded is not as good as the first Matrix film it sure is
close to the standard of the original. I don't understand the seeming
reluctance to accept this film a suitable continuation of the original
film. I'll be the first one to admit that Reloaded has a few slow
points and that the story line has a tendency towards the pretentious
but the film is also highly intelligent and entertaining but most
importantly the film gets the story from A to B with adequate and in
some cases remarkable character development.

Acting wise the film is in the same kind of league as the first film of
the series with a few mediocre performances, a few decent performances
and one or two excellent performances. Keanu Reeves plays Neo pretty
much like he did in the first movie and that is not bad. His monotone
voice is canceled out by his clear and well defined body language. His
overall performance is very fitting for the character which, lets face
it, is somewhat square and Keanu's acting fits that kind of character
very well. Carrie-Anne Moss has taken a small step down. I don't blame
her as much as I blame the writing. Her character, while still
ass-kicking, is too dependent on Neo. I know they love each other but
come on. Laurence Fishbourne shines as Morpheus. His performance is
slightly more stylized than in the first film but he steals almost
every scene he is in. Other semi-known actors make glorified cameos.
Actors like Jada Pinkett Smith, Monica Bellucci and Lambert Wilson are
great examples. Gloria Foster returns as the Oracle in her (sadly) last
performance as she died during the filming. Her one brief scene is both
highly interesting and well acted. As it was with the first film Hugo
Weaving provides the best acting by far. Although his screen time is
somewhat limited he manages to leave a lasting impression and becomes
one of my favorite screen baddies of all time. His performance is for
lack of a better word fantastic.

Effect wise Reloaded is a feast. There is literally something to look
at in every scene. The "real" world has been given a face lift to make
it more interesting. The real effects, however, take place inside the
matrix and just like in the first film the effects are absolutely
ground breaking. Rivaling the likes of Star Wars and LotR and that is
saying something. The people who think the story is pretentious and the
dialog stubby will undoubtedly get their adrenaline fix in the action
scenes. Some scenes had me holding my breath and gasping at how
beautiful and overwhelming it all was and as much as I love the
philosophical aspects of the film I can watch it for the effects
themselves as well. Without spoiling anything I can say that lovers of
cool fight scenes and fx are in for a hell of a treat with this one.

In terms of costumes the film has really grown into its own. Especially
Neo's costume in The Matrix is very cool and is a great improvement
over the previous film. Morpheus' and Trinity's costumes are the same
with minor changes and they still look cool. Agent Smith's costume has
changed slightly in the color scheme. His suit has become a bit darker
as if to signify that he is no longer an Agent of the system but a
rogue agent now. Also his sunglasses have changed so that they look
more rounded so they look more like Neo's sunglasses which of course
implicates their connection. Many of the secondary characters have
their own costumes as well mirroring their own personalities.

Were the film separated itself from other action packed films is of
course in the underlying philosophical and religious aspects. Once the
film has been watched a few times for the effects you can begin to see
some of the elements. I don't think its possible to fully translate and
analyze every element of the film. Mainly because every element can be
analyzed in a bunch of different ways. Without spoiling too much I can
say that if you look hard enough you will be able to find Plato,
Baudrillard, Gnosticism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christian elements and
some more. The people who tell matrix lovers to get a life for
searching the Matrix for a deeper meaning ought to open their eyes and
watch the film one more time. With that I'm not saying that you can't
be intelligent if you don't like the Matrix I am simply asking you to
give it another chance. You really won't regret it.

The Matrix Reloaded is an excellent film and it deserves a lot more
respect than it is getting and it is definitely underrated. I don't
expect people to agree but I do expect people to respect those who love
the Matrix sequels like me. I for one think that its hard to go wrong
with Reloaded as it is funny, moving, awe-inspiring and very
intelligent. I highly recommend this film to anyone.

9/10

*** This comment contains spoilers *** 

It's a pity Reloaded looks and feels so much like a bad sequel, to so
many. Even to me to begin with even if I kind of enjoyed parts of the
ride, a lot. But to me it helps looking at it as a bridge between
beginning and end. As a part of a whole. The concept is so promising. I
haven't had the chance to see the Animatrix yet, but surely I will. I
guess I will spend hours with the game too. In Matrix I just love how
interwoven and in balance the storyline is with the way its told. It
reached out and grabbed almost everyone. This time around it seems as
if there was too much to tell and too many dollars to play with in too
short a time. Less balance. Still.. I'm thrilled. 

Spoilers ahead. (You might need them) Matrix is so wonderfully
mythological. Instead of being ethnocentric it puts the light on
eternal religious questions in such a universal way. At the same time
it formulates the original reason, philosophical questions. It is about
knowledge and faith, belief. Controll through both sense and
sensibility. The conflict between gnosticism and Judae-Christianity if
we look in the rear mirror. 

At the same time it is so biblical to a westerner like me. I won't bore
you with all the name symbolism but with Neo himself. His actual name
is Tomas Anderson and he is caught in the system (like everyone else in
the years leading up to Y2K). In the bible Tomas is the disbeliever,
and Tomas also means twin. Anders means man, as in Andros- (android).
He is the doubtful son of man who is like the rest of us, who becomes
Neo, the new one. At the same time it mirrors the first of Christianity
and how it focused on the individual. There is no need for priests or
churches (system) for the individual to reach the transcendent, for man
to reach God. (And our heroes are individuals in small groups that
fight the system, like viruses in a computer. (I just love that
Nebukadnessar looks like a bug.) 

In the first film we see the creation of (the believing) man. In
Reloaded the religious theme takes a step back. Instead it is Free will
vs. Determinism which is the main conflict. Thereby the existential
perspectives which were planted in the first film can be developed.
Here it is amusing to relate to the first existentialists that focused
so much on free will and choice, Friedrich Nietsche and Soren
Kirkegaard (one atheist and one Christian. The first captain to enroll
freely in the final battle is called Soren). 

Knowledge and faith remains as a conflict in Reloaded here represented
by Lock and Morpheus. John Locke is called the father of The age of
enlightenment which is the time of reason in our history. To me it
looks like as if the Wachowski brothers are writing a mythological
history of ideas for our time. Finally they might embrace even time
after the postmodern. 

There is a hint of a cycle here. Matrix is about birth, Reloaded about
life and Revolutions about death (rebirth). Matrix is the becoming of
man. Reloaded is man as a builder of theories and civilizations. Power
and control is formed and developed. The Merovingian (400-600) are
called the first kings of Europe and are known for their writing and
the characters in their written language. (I am sure that you can find
parallels to this "code" in the Matrix-code.) Anyway Merovingian is the
one who has the 'key master' (the key to power and control?) The middle
ages with its mystery and ghosts (lack of reason and empirical method)
follows and can be seen in the set design, armor and weapons. 

The middle ages were followed by The renaissance with all its use of
Greek mythology The wife of Merovingian is Persephone who actually
emphasizes on the rebirth theme because she gives our heroes a second
chance to get to the 'key master', and as a goddess she is symbolized
by a grain that can sprout. 

Then comes The age of enlightenment with reason and empirical method
which created the necessary conditions for a new conception of the
world and industrialism. The living-conditions thereby changed
radically for people which resulted in the revolutions of the 19th
century and ideologically in the first existentialists, Soren and
Friedrich. (Existentialism had a new upsurge when God had left us all
alone once again and the world fell apart, during and after WW1 and WW2
during last century. ) The myth can be said to have survived by fleeing
into the music and later into film via melodrama. Which leads us to
were we and Matrix are right now. 

I guess I just had too high expectations when I saw Reloaded the first
time. It got better when I saw it a second time and right now it is one
of my favorite friends, or bedtime stories. Too bad Reloaded is made in
such a way that most people seem to (eventually) enjoy and point out
the cinematography at its best. The saga deserves more. 

Anyway The Matrix concept is already a classic piece of art, the latest
transcription of the bible, a new history of mankind, the steepest
roller-coaster and much, much, more.
<|_=00=_|>

Watching The Matrix Reloaded, one is absolutely entitled to say that it is
overloaded, too lengthy action sequences for instance, and indeed, a way
too
lengthy dancing scene in Zion.
But next to that, it is obvious that this sequal to The Matrix (1999)takes
the story to a whole new dimension. Different characters define the
working
of the matrix, and the meaning of life itself, in different ways,
depending
on their onthological background. A conclusion is not (yet) given, which
adds to the movie a kind of postmodern quality.
For as far as the action sequences are concerned: Groundbreaking. You'll
see
stuff that you've never seen before. Sometimes the scenes are a little
lengthy, which harmes the narrative, but that is compensated easily by the
visual spectacle.
And yes, the Architect at the end is difficult to understand, but when you
watch the film more than once, you'll find out that it does make sense
what
he says.
All together this movie may not be as fantastic as 'The Matrix', but it is
definitely a good movie that will keep you thinking for a
while.
<|_=00=_|>

Last night I was fortunate enough to stumble across some tix to the
"Reloaded" premiere.  Since the original "Matrix" came out a few years ago
everyone has imitated its' kenetic action style, which led me to think
there's no way they can recapture that fresh and exciting edge again.  But
they did.  The Wachowskis have way out done the new "Star Wars" films and
without a doubt have far surpassed the "X-Men films."   At times the
dialogue is clunky and the Zion scenes are a little too Star Trek and Buck
Rogers, but the action is always astonishing, and the humor is always in
the
right place...if not too much in the right place...For example Neo uses
one
of the many Agent Smiths to take down other Agent Smiths sending them all
crashing with the sound of falling bowling pins.  A little goofy but fun.
The action though, I can't say enough about.  The center chase scene is
awesome and the opening cycle scene is....  Okay, no more words, "The
Matrix: Reloaded" will not disappoint and by the time you reach the
cliffhanger ending you're more than ready for a break from this double
talking, mind bending adventure.

<|_=00=_|>

When the credits for the movie came up and yet another great song by Rage
Against The Machine blaring in my ears,
I just thought to myself, what a great piece of entertainment this movie
was.

I was a big fan of the first one (like other millions were) and was
eagerly
awaiting the sequel. Although it might not be
as good as the first one in terms of it shocking us the way it did in 99
when it brought to us such a new flavour in cinema in terms
of
development in action, special effects and its terrific story. All and all
it still held up very well considering the pressure this movie had on
its
shoulders to live up to the great expectation.

I think that's why a lot of people weren't real keen on this one, because
it
had such huge pressure, and whatever the
Wachowski's produced, it wasn't going to be good enough, or people would
say
it could or should of been better. I believe the Wachowski brothers made
it
more epic and like most sequels, you can tell that it had a s*** load more
money to work with. Apart from the Zion scene and the Twins not getting
enough screen time, this movie was right up there, and for a movie just to
sit back in awe and watch
all these fighting sequences, car chases and special effects in action,
it's
a special movie.

Well done Larry and Andy showing everyone just why we go to the movies,
Pure
escapism and entertainment.

<|_=00=_|>

I tried to remove anything that might be considered a spoiler.  I also
assume that you've seen the first movie or at least know the general
gist,
so if you haven't some of this might not make sense.

Plot:
This movie beats the audience over the head with tired philosophical
ramblings again and again in an attempt to get the theme across.  We are
bombarded again and again by questions of purpose, and destiny, and
choice,
and forced to endure the long, torturous platitude sessions that contain
them.

Neo, awakened from a dream in the last movie, now
begins a period of realization about his own existence.  There are a lot
of
revelations in this movie, which I'll be vague about so they won't seem
like
spoilers.

*If you're still worried vague references will spoil the movie, don't
read
the paragraph below.*

The strength and weakness of faith is revealed.  The strengths and
weaknesses of love, and its temporary nature, are also revealed.  The
interdependence of humans and technology, and our faith in technology,
are
also revealed.  The importance of choice and experience is revealed.
Explaining further things that are revealed would go into too much
detail,
so I will refrain (as the guidelines for writing a commentary asks).
Btw,
by "revealed" I mean pounded through our ears and eyes like
nails.

Storyline:
So how does Neo and the gang get from the end of the last movie to the
beginning of the next one?  In short, they keep the faith, and use and
abuse
overly-stylized action and bullet-time like it's going out of style (and
after this display, I'm hoping movie-goers and makers alike learn to
appreciate subtlety and originality a bit more).  More on that later.  To
not spoil anything, I will say no more than the promo material already
did:
Neo is still trying to figure out the Matrix, and he is looking for
answers
while trying to save the humans, and Zion, all while baddies are going
after
him and his cohorts.  The movie pretty much picks up where the last one
left
off.

Action:
While martial arts action and gunplay peppered its predecessor in
somewhat
equal parts, this movie focuses much more on martial arts than gunplay,
adding swords, sais, etc. to the mix.  Special effects are so often used
and
waved in the audience's face that it becomes really tiresome.  I've
discussed this movie with friends and coworkers alike, and nearly all of
them found some of the action sequences--especially the "Smith fight" we
all
heard would be in the movie--to be too long and tedious.  This is a huge
red
flag for action fans, because the end of an action sequence should either
leave you wanting a slight bit more, or completely content with the
awesomeness that just occured.

These fights scenes do neither.  They are over-stylized, over-the-top
sequences that are wooden and uninspired.  In the first movie, there was
a
real sense of desperation to some of the action, a sense that fighting
was
for survival, not just looking good (which I honestly don't think they
manage in Reloaded anyway) in black and leather.  Go watch Drunken Master
or
Iron Monkey after this movie to remind yourself of what good fighting
sequences are--you won't regret it.  In addition, the "Matrix abilities"
people have in Reloaded is not consistent, and what they actually do is
not
consistent.  The first movie had its inconsistencies here, but they
weren't
too glaring--unlike Reloaded.

Special effects are poured on and on and on.  Every little thing someone
does, be it just jump, somersault, spin, and in many cases just pose, are

slow-moed, bullet-timed, or over-accentuated by some sort of destruction.
It's evident the W Bros had a ton of money to throw at this movie, and
boy
did they throw it, with no real restraint.  Sharp editors could have
really
helped this, but the first movie was such a hit that free reign was
obviously given, which brings us to. . .

Character and dialogue:
I have already more or less said the dialogue was tired and full of
philosophical platitudes.  Actors can't really bring a lot of depth to
their
character when the script and direction is shoving character progression
audience's face, or neglecting it altogether.  The audience is at no time
given nuance and substance so they can contemplate the character on their
own.

Keanu's acting performance is stiff at best.  Keanu is good at acting
confused, and that's about all he does in this film.  He makes a decent
attempt to show passion between Neo and Trinity, but it falls
flat.

Lawrence tries to make Morpheus everything from Moses to Henry V, and be
as
cool as a cat throughout.  With the script he is provided, he makes a
noble
attempt, but it also falls flat.

Moss isn't very believable either.  Her look of concern is always the
same,
much like Keanu's, and the chemistry isn't there, although in their very
physical scenes they fake it well enough.

Hugo once again brought his weird sense of being an Agent program, but he
too suffered from the script's hand.  I actually find him to be the most
interesting character of the bunch, but instead of development they just
make him an excuse for a huge, drawn out fight scene.

All in all, this movie is beyond disappointing if you had good
expectations,
and on its own, as a stand-alone movie (which is not how it's supposed to
be
taken), it's still horrible.  I don't see The Matrix as deep, but I at
least
see it as an enjoyable scifi romp that has some interesting ideas, good
action, a few funny lines, and enough restrained symbolism and elusions
to
amuse the attentive.  Reloaded fails on all these counts, and I really
hope
the W Bros will give us a better experience in the 3rd installment.
Granted, I don't have a lot of hope left for that after this
film.
<|_=00=_|>

Spoilers of both this and The Matrix follow.

I liked the original Matrix a great deal.  It was not a deep movie,
despite
Fishburne's
attempts to philosophize, but it was fairly well paced, fun, and I have a
soft spot for
Hong Kong fights.

In the original, Neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy cube worker
Anderson.  By
day, corporate drone, and by night, brave hacker.  Eventually, he
eventually
is forced to
choose between these lives by his actions - does he become an outlaw
fighting the
machine, or does he go back to the safe, forgettable world he started in.
Interestingly,
he discovers that once one is shorn of illusions, life rather sucks.  He
has
his girl by his
side and his boon companions, but he eats processed swill, dresses in
sweats, and lives
in a truly skungy bit of machinery.  Still, the truth makes him
free.

At least part of the fun of that first movie lay in the "what if it were
me"
questions raised
in the viewer's mind.  What if _I_ were capable of the impossible?  What
if
I were "The
One".  It does not even matter that much what you are The One example of,
with a cool
title like that.

Further, agent Smith made a wonderful bad guy, as he embodied all of the
fear of
authority that we carry with us.  He was as unstoppable as a terminator,
and
as
merciless.

At the end of the Matrix, Neo must return to the Matrix to share his good
news of
freedom.

This movie fails to completely to carry through on the ideas of the
original
movie, and it
does so with such lack of gusto, such poor scriptwriting and such poor
editing that I
cannot believe they had planned these changes.  When the dialog is at a
fifth grade level,
with various long words dropped in randomly, I find it hard to believe
that
they
understand what they are saying.

My short list of characterization failures:

The Oracle goes from mildly helpful, if deceitful to utterly
obstructionist
without any real
reason.

Major "personalities" of the matrix are introduced without need - the
keymaster, for
example, was a cute idea, but just not that interesting a
character.

Fishburne loses his "advisor" role, and gets nothing to replace it
with.

The people of Zion are not particularly likable, nor would you really
_want_
them running
the world.

Special effects problems:

The fight scenes are pointless and intermitable.  In The Matrix, you felt
Neo could lose,
and that he had to become something greater in order to survive.  In The
Matrix
Reloaded, he is merely the viewpoint character of a particularly poorly
plotted video
game.

The fight on the freeway looked quite fake, and not that
interesting.

Pacing problems.

As I mentioned above, the fight scenes were interminable.

The rave went on too long - everyone in my row at the theater was looking
at
their
watch.  Not because we mind good dancing and good orgies, but because we
did
not
know about the people pictured, nor did we care.

Whatever hack wrote the creator's soliloquy should be blacklisted from the
business.  It
meandered, used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand,
and
was a waste
of time and a pacing killer.  The creator's speech could have been done in
a
tenth the
time, and with more peril as "Zion exists to give rebels a place to go so
they do not
destroy the Matrix.  There are now too many people who do not believe; the
matrix is in
danger of crashing and killing every person hooked up to it.  Further, the
earth cannot
support even the people in Zion, let alone these others.  You may choose
one
person
from Zion to form the new Zion, while I wipe the memories of the people
currently in the
Matrix."

Instead, we got a long, drawn out bunch of twaddle.  If someone argues
that
it is deep,
ask for a transcript, and try breaking down the sentences.  Each one is
too
long by
several clauses, and uses words with clearer, shorter synonyms.

So, in summary, not worth seeing.

I have seen the third one, and despite what a number of reviewers have
said,
skip it.  It
does not save this turkey.

The reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were "deep" should
go see
some truly deep movies.  Perhaps read a book or two on rhetoric and
debate,
and
perhaps a bit of philosophy.  This movie is just not hard to understand,
but
it is hard to
stomach.

   ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***
Continued...

From here on in the whole movie collapses in on itself. First we meet a
rogue program with the indication we're gonna get ghosts and vampires and
werewolves and the like. We get a guy with a retarded accent talking
endless
garbage, two 'ghosts' that serve no real purpose and have no character
what-so-ever and a bunch of henchmen. Someone's told me they're vampires
(straight out of Blade 2), but they're so undefined I didn't
realise.

The funny accented guy with a ridiculous name suffers the same problem as
the Oracle, only for far longer and far far worse. He has a simple point
about cause and effect, makes it, then continues to make it and make it
until it becomes convoluted and stupid. His final line before walking off
is
comparable to Storm's "do you know what happens to a toad..." line in
X-men
in levels of utter bland baddness. The chocolate cake is such a lazy,
pathetic cliche and Monica Bellucci as the wife does nothing other than
exactly what we expect the moment we see her.

And then we get another kung fu fight!!! WHY? Neo is, allegedly, The One.
He
can do anything. He has the ultimate power and what does he use it for.
Kung
bloody fu all the time. And while he can stop 1000 bullets, he still gets
cut by a sword and still makes a meal of 5 undecipherable henchmen
(vampires?). I wanted to see mind blowing powers. I wanted to see him do
the
wildest, craziest most insane s*** to people because he can do anything. I
got the same as before without the 'wow'.

The fabled car chase. That can't be bad. Well... no, it's not. It's just
not
what we've been tyold it was going to be. ALL the cool shots from this
scene
are in the trailer. Every one. So all possibly Wow has been taken from us
so
all we now get is a good chase sequence with, guess what, a kung fu
fight!!!
OK, it's not Neo, but you'd have thought he'd have explained to his
closest
friends about the reality of the Matrix. At least taught them something.
It's not hard.

"Hey, Morpheus, don't worry about what happens to you in the matrix. It's
not real. As long as you understand that nothing's real then nothing can
really harm you."

There you go. Simple.

OK, so the chase is not bad. It's never boring and it doesn't seem like 16
minutes. It's just so underwhelming. And still, it gets
worse.

The final climax to the movie is quite probably the worst imaginable. They
have this whole elaborate plan that involves three crews. They then only
show it sporadically between Morpheus's over long, super preachy,
monologue.
To make it worse, they never clearly define what this plan that needs 3
teams is. You know basically, but you don't know who's doing what, when,
so
when one crew goes down you just don't care and you don't know how this is
going to affect what goes on.

I'll sum it up though, it happens so Trinity can get back into the Matrix
to
setup the end. That's the only reason it happens. Which raises the
question,
why did they need to send 6 people originally? Trinity gets in in five
minutes by herself!

Neo's journey to the centre of the Matrix (so to speak) is handled equally
lazily. Ooohhh!!! He runs into another 100 Agent Smiths!!! Woooooo!!! That
must've taken a lot of thought. Only now they're in a corridor so the
fight
has no scale and is over in a moment. Man, what a grand
finale!!!

And then the Architect!!!

Remember everything I said was bad about the Oracle and the foreign guy?
Add
them together and double it, that's how truly appalling the Architect is.
The only reasonable potential of him is he's about to set up the
cliffhanging climax.

And then he blows it!

Let's look at the options he gives Neo. Choose one door and all humanity
dies (except 27!!!). Choose the other and all humanity dies!!! Considering
choice is something this film tries to explore it doesn't really give it's
hero one. If he had a choice of Save humanity and the missus dies or Save
the missus and kill humanity there's the potnetial for inner torment and
tension. Also, with Trinity being mid fall, the potential of a real
cliffhanger that would've made seeing the third more essential. But no. He
has save no-one or save the missus.

Now, the very worst thing about the original Matrix was Neo dying and then
coming back to life right at the end. The year it came out everyone was so
annoyed by how stupid Jar Jar was they didn't notice that the very end of
The Matrix made him look him Steven Hawking. "The Oracle told me I'd fall
in
love with the One, and I love you".... Come On!!!! How can the whole world
have missed how utterly terrible that was?

So, what do the Wachowski's do in the sequel? Well, they make the ending
of
the original look better. How? Well, by doing almost exactly the same
thing
again (only swapping characters) only so much worse I think my f a and r
keys would be worn out if I kept writing far before I got to
worse.

And the cliffhanger is just not really a cliffhanger. It's a
reminder.

Basically, this film is just bad. I really didn't want it to be bad, but
it
is. Bad in just so many ways. And to make matters worse, this isn't a film
with not enough budget. It's not a film with too short a schedule. It's
not
a film that's been rushed out. It's not a film where too much influence
has
come from the outside. This is exactly the film the Wachowski's set out to
make with Warner's fortune fully behind them. And that's what makes this
so
awful. At least Rancid Aluminium can say that it didn't haev enough time
or
money.

Matrix Reloaded. The worst film ever made? Maybe not quite. The most
disappointing and defalting film ever made.

Undeniably.

During one University Class on Film Violence our tutor went around
class asking the students to nominate a film where we felt the violence
was unrealistic . My nomination was the Randall Wallace debacle WE WERE
SOLDIERS down to the fact every time an American was killed there was
always enough time for the dying soldier to make a short speech as to
how much he loved his wife/mom /pet dog . One of the other students , a
young lad called Ivan , nominated the battle between Neo and the
multiple Mr Smiths' from THE MATRIX RELOADED . I remember thinking it
was a rather good nomination since it seemed to go on far longer than
needed and that Neo could have escaped the fight anytime he wanted .
Having recently seen the film again I have to say it's a brilliantly
obvious nomination since the sequence is ridiculous and unconvincing as
is the whole movie 

It's obvious that when THE MATRIX was released it was produced to be a
stand alone one off movie . Hollywood being Hollywood however it
doesn't stop people coming up with bad ideas if the motive is money .
RELOADED is a bad idea but its problem is that it's not only a bad idea
but it's a bad idea badly done 

A common complaint amongst the more analytical comments on this page
criticise the way when characters speak it sounds like they're giving
the most profound speeches in he history of cinema in a film that is
just an action franchise movie . Thisis entirely correct we get set
piece followed by long pretentious sententious dialogue followed by set
piece , followed by long talky scenes followed by set piece 

What really drags the film down is that the set pieces are both
overlong and very badly done . Watch the scene that Ivan criticised and
you'll notice that much of it is done via computer animation .
Especially the bit where Neo holds on to the pole and and kicks the
myriad of Smiths out of the frame . You'll be expecting Bugs Bunny to
appear chewing a carrot asking " What's up doc ? " It becomes literally
cartoonish . There's also a set piece on a freeway where a couple of of
ghostly twins try and eliminate the good guys often in hand to hand
combat . What lets this down is that both the choreography and editing
are very loose . You can see in your head the actors thinking " one two
three one two three left right left " as they try and assault one
another 

The original film was one of those rare movies that mixed a high
concept plot with genuinely exciting action sequences . This sequel has
none of that . It is nothing more than a cynical exercise in making
money . The only half decent thing about it is that it's only slightly
better than the following film THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS
