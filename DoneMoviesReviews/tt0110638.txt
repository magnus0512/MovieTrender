In the late 1970s two young girls named Virginia and Grace Kennedy
caused great interest in the academic disciplines of psychology and
linguistics. The girls, identical twin sisters, had developed a private
language quite incomprehensible to outsiders. Even after they had
learnt English, they continued to communicate with each other in their
secret language, which was partly a mixture of distorted English and
the German that was their grandmother's native tongue, but which also
contained some inexplicable vocabulary items. 

This was an example of an uncommon, but not unprecedented, phenomenon
known as 'idioglossia' or 'cryptophasia'. 'Nell' tells the story of an
even more extreme example of the same phenomenon. An eccentric and
reclusive old woman named Violet Kellty is found dead in her home, a
wooden cabin without electricity or running water in a remote mountain
are of North Carolina. The local doctor, Jerry Lovell, visits the
property to certify the death and discovers that, unknown to the
community, Violet had a daughter, Nell, living with her. Nell is unable
to speak English and can only speak an unknown language. Although in
her late twenties, she has never been outside her home and the forests
which surround it, and knows nothing of the outside world. 

A psychiatrist, Paula Olsen, sent to investigate the case, decides that
Nell is mentally retarded, but Lovell, who is becoming increasingly
fascinated by this strange young woman, contests this diagnosis. The
judge responsible for deciding Nell's future, decides that she should
be kept under observation for three months so that more information can
be obtained. Jerry and Paula move into the woods to observe, and
gradually start to find out more about Nell's past. They learn that she
had a twin sister, May, who died as a child, and that her
seemingly-strange speech is actually a mixture of distorted English
learnt from her mother (who had a speech defect as the result of a
series of strokes) and words remembered from a private language spoken
with her twin. The question they have to resolve is whether Nell should
be committed to a mental institution or allowed to continue her life in
the woods. In order to do so, they find that they need to learn how to
communicate with her. 

The most outstanding feature of the film is Jodie Foster's performance
in the title role- a remarkable one even by the standards of this
talented actress. Throughout the film Foster speaks only in Nell's
unearthly-sounding private language, but is able to use this, together
with gestures and facial expressions, to convey a full range of
emotions. The nearest parallel is probably Marlee Matlin's equally
remarkable performance in 'Children of a Lesser God', another film
about difficulties in communication. What emerges most powerfully here
is the traumatic nature of Nell's position- hitherto happy in her
limited world, she is suddenly confronted with a range of people and
situations she never knew existed. Foster certainly deserved her Oscar
nomination; whether she deserved to win I cannot say, as I have never
seen 'Blue Sky', the film for which Jessica Lange won the award. 

At the heart of the film is a triangular relationship between Nell,
Jerry and Paula. Paula initially leans towards the view that Nell
belongs in an institution, and clashes with Jerry who takes the
opposite view, but as the film progresses she comes to share his
opinion and his concern for Nell. The two first become friends and then
fall in love, brought together by Nell, who forms the third side of the
triangle. One can say that there are also love-relationships between
Nell and Jerry and Nell and Paula, but because these relationships are
platonic rather than sexual in nature they serve to bring Jerry and
Paula together rather than divide them. This means that Jerry and Paula
play key roles in the film; fortunately, Liam Neeson and Natasha
Richardson both play their parts very well, although in a more
understated manner than Foster. 

Many of the criticisms which have been made of the film are, I believe,
due to misconceptions. The film critic of The Guardian, for example,
criticised it for being overly politically correct in its treatment of
the 'mentally challenged'. Apart from the fact that that is an odd
criticism to find in a newspaper which is one of the strongest bastions
of political correctness in Britain, it is made quite clear in the film
that Nell is neither mentally ill nor mentally handicapped. She merely
speaks a different language (both literally and metaphorically) from
the rest of the world. Some have taken exception to the brief scenes of
nudity, but the purpose of these is not eroticism, but rather to
demonstrate Nell's innocence.

Another criticism which I have seen made of this film, both on this
board and elsewhere, is that it is pushing a trite or simplistic
'message', normally along the lines of 'nature is better than
civilization' or 'ignorance is bliss'. In my opinion, this criticism is
misconceived; 'Nell' is not a didactic film of that sort. Certainly,
Nell herself has many admirable characteristics- gentleness, the
ability to love and to be loved, a capacity for joy and a love of
nature- but nowhere in the film is there any argument that one has to
be ignorant or a feral child of nature in order to share these
characteristics. If there are villains in the film they are not
abstractions such as 'civilisation' or 'modern society', but rather
those individuals who want to exploit Nell for their own ends- the
journalist hungry for a scoop, the rowdy town youths who want to use
her either for mockery or for sexual pleasure, and the academic
Alexander Paley. Paley is keen to have Nell committed; he tries to
justify this as objective concern for her welfare, but his motives are
really self-seeking. He sees Nell as a first-class subject for research
which will bring him kudos in the world of academia. 

What gives the film its power is not any obvious 'message' but its
deeply poetic and spiritual tone, deriving both from the acting of the
three central characters and the exquisite photography of the North
Carolina landscapes. It is a film from which different viewers will
draw different conclusions- some may see it, for example, as a
religious allegory about the redeeming power of love, while others may
view it in a more literal way. It may be too quiet and poetic for some
tastes, but in my view this is an unjustly neglected work, one of the
finest and most powerful films of the nineties. 10/10

I just watched this movie for the second time. One word:
wow!

This is one of the rare gems that you can tell when actors and actresses
put
everything into their performances, and actually go beyond the role. How
can
I tell? At the very end of the movie, the emotion of the moment that
Jodie's
character feels towards the scene with the little girl reminding her of
her
lost sister is enough to make Jodie herself cry and wipe away a tear.
Incredible. It's very rare to see that level of immersion into a role
where
the actors involved feel real emotion about a scene. I'm willing to bet
that
moment of grace at the very end of the movie wasn't scripted nor acted on
Jodie's part. You simply cannot get more heartfelt emotion into a scene
than
what was shown at the end of Nell. Brilliant and well-acted movie by all.
A
definite 10.

I haven't seen or read the play 'Idioglossia' on which this movie was based,
but its title indicates where the emphasis was probably placed... on the
attempt to communicate and understand this woman who was raised under
extraordinary conditions.  Movies don't usually thrive when done in the same
tight, focused manner of a stage play, so it's customary to expand
adaptations with additional locations, events, and subplots.  Unfortunately
for 'Nell' these are utterly conventional, filled with stereotypes and a
sampling of the usual cliches.  This takes time and attention away from the
fascinating core story and the superb performance by Jodie
Foster.

The story begins with the discovery that a reclusive old woman has died and
has left a grown daughter alone in their remote cabin.  Originally she is
thought to be a "wild child" since she doesn't understand English and only
utters what sounds like gibberish.  Besides that, her behaviour is very
peculiar and everyone's first impression is that she is also somewhat
retarded, if not mentally ill.

But the movie and Foster display an understanding of their subject matter
almost unique in a Hollywood movie.  A true "wild child" (that is, a child
who grows up isolated from human contact without learning a language) pretty
much never can learn to speak normally or function independently in society.
 But this isn't the case for Nell.  She lived with her loving mother all her
life and did indeed learn to speak as any child would.  It's just that the
language we hear her speak is unique to herself (the definition of
'idioglossia') which was caused by a couple of different
circumstances.

Her mother had suffered a stroke (if I recall correctly) which drastically
affected her own ability to speak clearly, and this was the model for Nell's
own speech, never having heard any other.  Nell also had a twin sister who
died when they were children.  Typically twins develop their own language
("twin speech") to talk to each other when they are very young.  Also
typically they tend to outgrow and forget this language as they grow older. 
The movie postulates that Nell and her sister never discarded their
language, not implausible considering their circumstances, and that Nell
retained into adulthood much of that language even after the death of her
sister.

The final elements of Nell's seemingly odd behaviour is simply a matter of a
clash of cultures.  Nell and her family were essentially a people unto
themselves, living in isolation and out of contact with the rest of society.
 Some of their customs and beliefs were generated from the traumas suffered
by the mother, others spontaneously arose from simply living the life they
were leading.  These seem peculiar to outsiders from our own, very
different, culture; though it's just ordinary life to Nell.  Even more
peculiar is the outside world to Nell.  The shock and recoil that she often
undergoes comes from being suddenly confronted by inexplicable, unimagined,
and overwhelming events totally beyond a lifetime's experience and coming
directly on the heels of the death of her mother.

When the movie centers on these elements it is entirely engrossing.  Foster
is fully convincing in her role, and clearly understands the complex nature
and history of Nell.  Despite everyone's first impressions, Nell is never
anything but an intelligent adult woman confronting a strange and often
hostile world, and attempting to adapt to it as best she can.  Her
interactions with Neeson's and Richardson's characters are often complex and
traumatic enough to keep the film moving in the absence of the other,
extraneous, elements.

Had the movie concentrated more intently on this interaction and devoted
more time to it, which is really the whole point of the film, or had it done
a better and more original job of expanding it's vision during it's
adaptation to film (those parts involving the sheriff's wife showed
unexploited potential), 'Nell' could have been a great film.  Certainly the
superb cinematography shows one of the great advantages of film over the
stage.  But there was too much time spent on weak scenes for the movie to
ever fully blossom. 

So overall, despite its flaws, 'Nell' is a good film with many fascinating
elements and an excellent performance by Jodie Foster.  And that makes it
well worth watching.

This film really surprised me, because it was really good. But it mostly
surprised me, because I read here that this would be a drama and I must say
I disagree. Drama stands for sadness and melancholy, whereas this film stood
for humanism. I mean Nell is basically as happy as can be and who are we
(the people in the film) to tell her that her way of life is not good? I
know this might sound strange, but I see this film as a metaphor for human
behavior. We reject what is not like us (race, religion, gender, sexual
preference, skin color and so on) and think those people ought to be like
us, because they are not normal'. Well you tell me who is more normal: Nell
or the people who want to put her away; Nell or the journalists; Nell or the
boys in the bar? I will tell you: Nell, Nell and Nell. I can recommend this
film to everyone and I hereby want to thank all people involved and
especially Jodie Foster for her great performance.

Nell is one of the most captivating, moving and thought provoking films I
have ever seen in my life. The acting all round is superb, including a
truly
fine performance by Jodie Foster. This film is nothing short of
spectacular,
boasting a strong script, beautiful scenery and excellent direction.
Overall, Nell is nothing short of breath taking. I strongly advise to see
it. You won't be disappointed.
<|_=00=_|>
remember this film, and subsequent VHS tape, getting a fair share of
publicity when it was released. The story certainly was different and
so interesting to me (on the first viewing) that Jodie Foster's
constant incoherent phrases didn't bother me. They aggravated a lot of
other viewers, however. However, after three looks at this film, 

I had had enough, too, not because of Foster but because this is a
disturbing film. It's not a lot of fun to watch. The fact I watched it
three times tells you it's pretty darned good.

Liam Neeson played a no-nonsense good guy. Natasha Richardson also adds
to this unique story. 

I would definitely recommend this film to first-time viewers but be
wary it's different and not always pleasant to see and hear. I don't
want to say more in fear of spoiling the story, but kudos to Foster for
an outstanding effort.
<|_=00=_|>

Having never seen this film before, I "stumbled" on to it this morning about
10 minutes after it started on A&E and was so mesmerized that I watched the
whole movie, and really liked it! It is well acted (Jodie Foster is
INCREDIBLE), as is Natasha Richardson and Liam Neeson, and it's just an all
around GOOD movie. I recommend it very highly, and stopped short of giving
it a "10" because it didn't have one of those neat what-happened-to-her
title-over endings, though the ending IS
a good one.
<|_=00=_|>
I can't think of another movie better than this one that I have seen
anyway so I nominate it for a ten. The thing about great art is it
engages the consciousness of the perceiver creatively with the same
amount of energy the perceiver invests. That might sound like a lot of
pseudo-babble so let me try again. What you see is what you get with
great art--and this relationship happens unpretentiously. In an ideal
creation there is nothing presumptuous about the art. No doubt there
are moments of stereotypes, but these could be just as easily blamed on
bad acting from the supporting cast, or simple lapses in composition. I
don't think anyone could seriously say stereotypes are a fundamental
weakness of this flick, mainly because the use of stereotypes is
serving a larger purpose to the story--at least as I see it. This is
probably one of the most complex, multi-layered movies I have ever
seen. We witness all the archetypes of good storytelling utilized in
ever-meshing ways. How sexual violence is a fetish, and how an innocent
mind sees it as simple playing. And in every scene we are given, the
meaning of Foster's character and what she represents grows. The ending
under these terms is truly remarkable and frankly a surprise if
witnessed representationally. I mean these are heavy comments on
reality folks. I didn't see the play the screenplay was based on, but
over and over again I kept thinking "Who the hell wrote this thing? Who
directed this?" It is masterful, and if you can't see it that way, I
don't know, go read some books on critical theory, on the development
of human consciousness, on Aristotle's's poetics, etc. It is
counterpoint perfection--extremely well crafted, and a powerful
commentary on not only our culture and "civilization," but what it
means to be human in this contemporary moment. Oh yeah, Jodi Foster is
outstanding. We could make a case that she and her character are the
center of this movie, except that it is the world unfolding around her
that makes this such great drama. I think I have to go back to her
Disney-era movies to think of a truly awful movie she has made. But
that shouldn't count either. I never thought those movies were all that
bad, but then I simply watched them as a kid.
<|_=00=_|>

It was a great and simple story. Simply about a woman raised in the wild,
unable to speak proper english due to her mothers stroke and she is trying
to be brought into "civilisation".

Neeson and Foster are the stars of this film!! Not just because of their
star status but they really showed talent in this film. Foster is brilliant
as the vulnerable but independent Nell and Neeson is great as her "guardian
angel". 

This film has its funny bits but the ending... well if youre dead sensitive,
get the tissues out. When Nell speaks in the courts, I was causing a
flood!!!!

I give it a 10/10. Definetly one to keep forever.

I bought the DVD of this film, which I was completely unaware of,
because of a review I accidentally came across. Jodie Foster's
performance as Nell made an almost incredible character totally
believable. How she didn't get an Oscar for her performance says more
about the Oscars than about the enormous range and empathy of this
superb actress.She was assisted by a wonderful complementary and
vulnerable performance from Liam Neesom and the sensitive exploration
of a very difficult subject by Michael Apted. I found myself crying
without immediately understanding why. I then realised that the film
had plumbed the depths of my humanity to levels I did not realise
existed. It confronted the question of what it is to be a fully
individual human being going beyond our place in a so called civilised
society to our almost instinctive spiritual responses to the natural
world and to relationship. This is a truly deep and rewarding film
which deserves a wide audience. My only criticism is that the
transition to Nell's independence was hurried towards the end in the
interests of dramatic denouement.
