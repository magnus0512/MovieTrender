Harrison Ford\u2019s career started in 1964 when he travelled to\u00a0California in search of a voice-over job.\u00a0He never received that position, but instead signed a contract with\u00a0Columbia Pictures where he earned $150 weekly to play small fill in roles in\u00a0various films.\u00a0 Through the 60\u2019s Harrison\u00a0worked on several TV shows including Gunsmoke,\u00a0Ironside, Kung Fu, and American Style.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until 1967 that Harrison received\u00a0his first credited role in the Western film, A Time for Killing. Dissatisfied with the meager roles he was being\u00a0offered, Ford took a hiatus from acting to work as a self-employed carpenter.\u00a0This seemingly odd diversion turned out to be a blessing in disguise for\u00a0Harrison\u2019s acting career when he was soon hired by famous film producer George\u00a0Lucas.\u00a0 This was a turning point in\u00a0Harrison\u2019s life that led to him be casted in milestone roles such as Hans Solo\u00a0and Indiana Jones.\u00a0 Since his most famous\u00a0roles in the Star Wars Trilogy and Raiders\u00a0of the Lost Ark, Harrison Ford has starred in over 40 films.\u00a0 Many criticize his recent work, saying his\u00a0performances have been lackluster leading to commercially disappointing films.  Harrison has always worked hard to protect his off-screen\u00a0private life, keeping details about his children and marriages quite.\u00a0 He has a total of five children including one\u00a0recent adoption with third and current wife Calista Flockhart. In addition to\u00a0acting Harrison Ford is passionate about environmental conservation, aviation,\u00a0and archeology.", "adult": false}
