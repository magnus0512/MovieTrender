His work on the series has earned him several awards and more than \u00a360 million.\n\nRadcliffe made his acting debut at age ten in BBC One's television movie David Copperfield (1999), followed by his film debut in 2001's The Tailor of Panama. Cast as Harry at the age of eleven, Radcliffe has starred in seven Harry Potter films since 2001, with the final installment releasing in July 2011.
