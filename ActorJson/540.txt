He started his career in Canadian film and television projects, where his portrayal of Stanley Raymond Kowalski in the TV series Due South was his first international success. After years acting in over ninety Canadian and international projects he became widely known for his portrayal of the Cylon Leoben Conoy in the reimagined Battlestar Galactica, and following that, his role as record producer Lew Ashby in the Showtime TV series Californication. Regularly cast as a bad guy in movies and even more often in his numerous guest appearances in television series, his participation in Canadian productions gives him an opportunity to show a broader palette of his acting abilities, which have been recognized by several awards.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Callum Keith Rennie,\u00a0licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "adult": false}
