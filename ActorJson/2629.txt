Armstrong grew up in County Durham in North East England. He first became interested in acting through Shakespeare productions at his grammar school. Since his career began in the early 1970s, he has played, in his words, \"the full spectrum of characters from the grotesque to musicals... I always play very colourful characters, often a bit crazy, despotic, psychotic.\"\n\nHis numerous credits include six different Dickens adaptations and seven series as eccentric ex-detective Brian Lane in New Tricks. Armstrong is also an accomplished stage actor who spent nine years with the Royal Shakespeare Company. He originated the role of Th\u00e9nardier in the London production of Les Mis\u00e9rables and he won an Olivier Award for playing the title role in Sweeney Todd.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Alun Armstrong (actor), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "adult": false}
