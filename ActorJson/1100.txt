He was awarded the title of Mr. Universe at age 20 and went on to win the Mr. Olympia contest a total of seven times. Schwarzenegger has remained a prominent presence in the sport of bodybuilding and has written several books and numerous articles on the sport.\n\nSchwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action film icon, noted for his lead roles in such films as Conan the Barbarian, The Terminator, Commando and Predator. He was nicknamed the \"Austrian Oak\" and the \"Styrian Oak\" in his bodybuilding days, \"Arnie\" during his acting career and more recently the \"Governator\" (a portmanteau of \"Governor\" and \"Terminator\").\n\nAs a Republican, he was first elected on October 7, 2003 in a special recall election (referred to in Schwarzenegger campaign propaganda as a \"Total Recall\") to replace then-Governor Gray Davis. Schwarzenegger was sworn in on November 17, 2003, to serve the remainder of Davis's term. Schwarzenegger was then re-elected on November 7, 2006, in California's 2006 gubernatorial election, to serve a full term as governor, defeating Democrat Phil Angelides, who was California State Treasurer at the time. Schwarzenegger was sworn in for his second term on January 5, 2007.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Arnold Schwarzenegger, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "adult": false}
