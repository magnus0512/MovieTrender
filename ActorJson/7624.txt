In addition, he headed the first major successful challenge to the industry's censorship organization, the Comics Code Authority, and forced it to reform its policies. Lee subsequently led the expansion of Marvel Comics from a small division of a publishing house to a large multimedia corporation.\n\nHe was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Stan Lee, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "adult": false}
