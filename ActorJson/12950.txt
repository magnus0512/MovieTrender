(Kieselbach), a ballet dancer, and George Harris Kennedy, an orchestra leader and musician. He had German, Irish, and English ancestry. A World War II veteran, Kennedy at one stage in his career cornered the market at playing tough, no-nonsense characters who were either quite crooked or possessed hearts of gold. Kennedy notched up an impressive 200+ appearances in both TV and film, and was well respected within the Hollywood community. He started out in TV westerns in the late 1950s and early 1960s: Have Gun - Will Travel\u00a0(1957),\u00a0Rawhide\u00a0(1959),\u00a0Maverick\u00a0(1957),\u00a0Colt .45\u00a0(1957), among others; before scoring minor roles in films including\u00a0Lonely Are the Brave\u00a0(1962),\u00a0The Sons of Katie Elder\u00a0(1965) and\u00a0The Flight of the Phoenix\u00a0(1965). The late 1960s was a very busy period for Kennedy, and he was strongly in favor with casting agents, appearing in\u00a0Hurry Sundown\u00a0(1967),\u00a0The Dirty Dozen\u00a0(1967) and scoring an Oscar win as Best Supporting Actor for his performance in\u00a0Cool Hand Luke\u00a0(1967). The disaster film boom of the 1970s was kind to Kennedy, too, and his talents were in demand for\u00a0Airport(1970) and the three subsequent sequels, as a grizzled cop in\u00a0Earthquake\u00a0(1974), plus the buddy/road film\u00a0Thunderbolt and Lightfoot\u00a0(1974) as vicious bank robber Red Leary.\n\nThe 1980s saw Kennedy appear in a mishmash of roles, playing various characters; however, Kennedy and\u00a0Leslie Nielsen\u00a0surprised everyone with their comedic talents in the hugely successful\u00a0The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!\u00a0(1988), and the two screen veterans hammed it up again in,\u00a0The Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear\u00a0(1991), plus\u00a0Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult\u00a0(1994).\n\nKennedy remained busy in Hollywood and lent his distinctive voice to the animated\u00a0Cats Don't Dance\u00a0(1997) and the children's action film\u00a0Small Soldiers\u00a0(1998). A Hollywood stalwart for nearly 50 years, he is one of the most enjoyable actors to watch on screen. His last role was in the film\u00a0The Gambler\u00a0(2014), as\u00a0Mark Wahlberg's character's grandfather.\n\nGeorge Kennedy died on February 28, 2016 in Middleton, Idaho.", "adult": false}
