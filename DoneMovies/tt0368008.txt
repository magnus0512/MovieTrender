Brokering the incident for political capital, Shaw eventually becomes a vice-presidential nominee, while Marco is haunted by dreams of what happened -- or didn't happen -- in Kuwait. As Marco (now a Major) investigates, the story begins to unravel, to the point where he questions if it happened at all. Is it possible the entire unit was kidnapped and brainwashed to believe Shaw is a war hero as part of a plot to seize the White House? Some very powerful people at Manchurian Global corporation appear desperate to stop him from finding out.", "video": false, "id": 14462, "genres": [{"id": 18, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 53, "name": "Thriller"}, {"id": 9648, "name": "Mystery"}], "title": "The Manchurian Candidate", "tagline": "This summer everything is under control.", "vote_count": 428, "homepage": "", "belongs_to_collection": null, "original_language": "en", "status": "Released", "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "imdb_id": "tt0368008", "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/2EK85HcE4qNdpRHkUWNC1CjNsTW.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Paramount Pictures", "id": 4}, {"name": "Scott Rudin Productions", "id": 258}, {"name": "Clinica Estetico", "id": 1274}], "release_date": "2004-07-30", "popularity": 8.011489, "original_title": "The Manchurian Candidate", "budget": 80000000, "vote_average": 6.2, "runtime": 129}
