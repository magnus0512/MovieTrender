When Mac McDonald loses his son in an accident, the ensuing 17 years of bitterness and pain erodes his love for his family and leaves him angry with God ... and just about everyone else. Mac's rage stonewalls his career in the police department and makes for a combustible situation when he's partnered with Sam Wright, a rising star on the force who happens to be a part-time pastor and a loving family man. Can they somehow join forces to help one another when it's impossible for either of them to look past their differences-especially the most obvious one? Every day, we have the opportunity to rebuild relationships and heal deep wounds by extending and receiving God's grace. Offer THE GRACE CARD ... and never underestimate the power of God's love.", "video": false, "id": 54897, "genres": [{"id": 18, "name": "Drama"}], "title": "The Grace Card", "tagline": "Never Underestimate The Power Of Grace ...", "vote_count": 10, "homepage": "http://www.thegracecardmovie.com/", "belongs_to_collection": null, "original_language": "en", "status": "Released", "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "imdb_id": "tt1544600", "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/ytv8uZOvCPj0d7fz37BhwcQYZgH.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "GraceWorks Pictures", "id": 33632}], "release_date": "2011-02-25", "popularity": 4.585765, "original_title": "The Grace Card", "budget": 200000, "vote_average": 6.5, "runtime": 101}
