From then on, Whangara chiefs, always the first-born, always male, have been considered Paikea's direct descendants. Pai, an 11-year-old girl in a patriarchal New Zealand tribe, believes she is destined to be the new chief. But her grandfather Koro is bound by tradition to pick a male leader. Pai loves Koro more than anyone in the world, but she must fight him and a thousand years of tradition to fulfill her destiny.", "video": false, "id": 1088, "genres": [{"id": 18, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 10751, "name": "Family"}], "title": "Whale Rider", "tagline": "", "vote_count": 118, "homepage": "http://www.whaleriderthemovie.com/", "belongs_to_collection": null, "original_language": "en", "status": "Released", "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "mi", "name": ""}], "imdb_id": "tt0298228", "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/gk0gnxKDrRGa1J8cN6bYz1aHLW6.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "South Pacific Pictures", "id": 654}], "release_date": "2003-01-30", "popularity": 5.696953, "original_title": "Whale Rider", "budget": 8000000, "vote_average": 7.2, "runtime": 101}
