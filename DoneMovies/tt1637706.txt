For sisters Liz, Miranda and Natalie, that person is their perennially upbeat brother Ned, an erstwhile organic farmer whose willingness to rely on the honesty of mankind is a less-than-optimum strategy for a tidy, trouble-free existence. Ned may be utterly lacking in common sense, but he is their brother and so, after his girlfriend dumps him and boots him off the farm, his sisters once again come to his rescue. As Liz, Miranda and Natalie each take a turn at housing Ned, their brother's unfailing commitment to honesty creates more than a few messes in their comfortable routines. But as each of their lives begins to unravel, Ned's family comes to realize that maybe, in believing and trusting the people around him, Ned isn't such an idiot after all.", "video": false, "id": 59968, "genres": [{"id": 35, "name": "Comedy"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Drama"}], "title": "Our Idiot Brother", "tagline": "Everybody has one", "vote_count": 379, "homepage": "http://www.ouridiotbrother.com/", "belongs_to_collection": null, "original_language": "en", "status": "Released", "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "imdb_id": "tt1637706", "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/lAmJ2RomLgS6wjpBWlT7WNjEiv6.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "The Weinstein Company", "id": 308}, {"name": "Likely Story", "id": 1785}, {"name": "Big Beach Films", "id": 12808}, {"name": "Yuk Films", "id": 19749}], "release_date": "2011-08-26", "popularity": 6.053078, "original_title": "Our Idiot Brother", "budget": 10000000, "vote_average": 6.0, "runtime": 90}
