Howl, the film, recounts this dark moment using three interwoven threads: the tumultuous life events that led a young Allen Ginsberg to find his true voice as an artist, society's reaction (the obscenity trial), and mind-expanding animation that echoes the startling originality of the poem itself. All three coalesce in a genre-bending hybrid that brilliantly captures a pivotal moment-the birth of a counterculture.", "video": false, "id": 38568, "genres": [{"id": 18, "name": "Drama"}], "title": "Howl", "tagline": "The Obscenity Trial That Started a Revolution.
