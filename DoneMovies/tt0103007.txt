The judge gives him another option, which he accepts -- he must live in his rat-infested hell hole until he brings it up to liveable standards. The judge gives him 120 days, during which time Louie meets many of his tenants, including drug dealer Marlon (Ruben Blades). Over time, Louie grows more sympathetic with their problems and sees the results of his own greediness. Unfortunately, Louie's father, Big Lou Kritski (Vincent Gardenia), is the real owner of the property, and he resists his son's entreaties to spend money to clean up the place.", "video": false, "id": 53287, "genres": [{"id": 35, "name": "Comedy"}], "title": "The Super", "tagline": "The best way to punish a slumlord is to make him a tenant.", "vote_count": 23, "homepage": "", "belongs_to_collection": null, "original_language": "en", "status": "Released", "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "imdb_id": "tt0103007", "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/x3QhmCjgo5aUl9wVxO6YEAOUTM4.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "JVC Entertainment", "id": 182}, {"name": "Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation", "id": 306}, {"name": "Largo Entertainment", "id": 1644}], "release_date": "1991-10-04", "popularity": 3.998354, "original_title": "The Super", "budget": 22000000, "vote_average": 5.6, "runtime": 84}
