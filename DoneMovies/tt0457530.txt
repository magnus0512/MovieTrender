Divided by their diverse reactions to a nascent ideology, the Steeds struggle to hold together as the strength of their convictions and their filial bonds are tested. The stirring narrative of the faith that led a persecuted people to Missouri and beyond is one of the most poignant untold tales of American history. It is the account of a valiant struggle to exercise the rights promised by a fledgling nation. \"The Work and the Glory: American Zion\" unearths the story of the passion behind the movement which eventually launched the largest American migration and the colonization of the West: the vision of a promised land in America.", "video": false, "id": 14631, "genres": [{"id": 18, "name": "Drama"}], "title": "The Work and the Glory II: American Zion", "tagline": "", "vote_count": 6, "homepage": "http://www.workandtheglory.com/", "belongs_to_collection": {"poster_path": "/t1gKSuUPja7SLhBgNnfB7b6Vkqn.jpg", "backdrop_path": null, "name": "The Work and the Glory Collection", "id": 243738}, "original_language": "en", "status": "Released", "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "imdb_id": "tt0457530", "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/txGAAfWVjSVIhJxFaSBzAuhUEQc.jpg", "production_companies": [], "release_date": "2005-10-21", "popularity": 0.80974, "original_title": "The Work and the Glory II: American Zion", "budget": 6500000, "vote_average": 8.0, "runtime": 100}
