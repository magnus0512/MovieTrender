Curmudgeonly old Frank lives by himself. His routine involves daily visits to his local library, where he has a twinkle in his eye for the librarian. His grown children are concerned about their father\u2019s well-being and buy him a caretaker robot. Initially resistant to the idea, Frank soon appreciates the benefits of robotic support \u2013 like nutritious meals and a clean house \u2013 and eventually begins to treat his robot like a true companion.
