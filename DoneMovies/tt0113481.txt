In a dystopian 2021, Johnny (Keanu Reeves) is a data trafficker who has an implant that allows him to securely store data too sensitive for regular computer networks. On one delivery run, he accepts a package that not only exceeds the implant's safety limits - and will kill him if the data is not removed in time - but also contains information far more important and valuable than he had ever imagined. On a race against time, he must avoid the assassins sent to kill him and remove the data before it, too, ends his life.", "video": false, "id": 9886, "genres": [{"id": 12, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Drama"}, {"id": 878, "name": "Science Fiction"}, {"id": 53, "name": "Thriller"}], "title": "Johnny Mnemonic", "tagline": "The hottest data on earth.
