With his navigation equipment and radio disabled, the man sails unknowingly into the path of a violent storm. Despite his success in patching the breached hull, his mariner's intuition and a strength that belies his age, the man barely survives the tempest. Using only a sextant and nautical maps to chart his progress, he is forced to rely on ocean currents to carry him into a shipping lane in hopes of hailing a passing vessel. But with the sun unrelenting, sharks circling and his meager supplies dwindling, the ever-resourceful sailor soon finds himself staring his mortality in the face.", "video": false, "id": 152747, "genres": [{"id": 28, "name": "Action"}, {"id": 12, "name": "Adventure"}, {"id": 18, "name": "Drama"}], "title": "All Is Lost", "tagline": "Never give up.", "vote_count": 708, "homepage": "", "belongs_to_collection": null, "original_language": "en", "status": "Released", "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "imdb_id": "tt2017038", "adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/ygQQHmscHQWmJ2uQzXdxLE9Yszz.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Sudden Storm Productions", "id": 6742}, {"name": "FilmNation Entertainment", "id": 7493}, {"name": "Treehouse Pictures", "id": 14580}, {"name": "Before the Door Pictures", "id": 14861}, {"name": "Washington Square Films", "id": 14862}, {"name": "Black Bear Pictures", "id": 22146}], "release_date": "2013-10-18", "popularity": 9.23843, "original_title": "All Is Lost", "budget": 9000000, "vote_average": 6.6, "runtime": 106}
